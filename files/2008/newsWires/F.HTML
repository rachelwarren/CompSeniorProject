<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are just thrilled, we are elated, it's an amazing victory,&quot; said John Stemberger, attorney and head of Florida4marriage.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a sad night but in a lot of ways, it's a great night for a lot of Americans. John McCain is a great man, a hero. But Barack Obama is our president so I hope he does a great job. I'm sure he will.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Republican chairman Jim Greer reacts to Obama's victory: &quot;No matter how good of a swimmer you are, an extremely strong current can push you back. It was a very close race. The Republican Party of Florida still has and will continue to have the best political organization in the nation but with all the hard work and all the commitment and all of our grassroots volunteers, the current, the anti-Republican current, in many ways was extremely strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the effect of the election cannot be pinned on the ground game,&quot; he said in an interview outside the state GOP headquarters in Tallahassee. &quot;We had a very competitive game. We did 33 percent more in phone calls and door knocks than we did in 2004. Simply at the end of the day, there were just some political environment issues we couldn't overcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his earlier criticism of the campaign: &quot;I think the party and the McCain campaign worked very well together as we came to the conclusion. Everybody always has ideas but at the end of the day, no matter what we had done on the ground game, I don't think we could have overcome any of this. I don't see anything more we could have done to overcome this anti-Republican environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The freshman Democratic House member moments ago told the Buzz he was going to call his Republican opponent in the House District 32 race and concede defeat. &quot;From the day I got elected, they said they would take their seat back,&quot; Sasso said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's plain politics and that's what it is, it's hardball. I would have liked to work with Republicans and Democrats and try to get some good things done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greer, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, said months ago (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/2008/05/greer-rep-tony.html) that the Cocoa Beach Democrat was a marked man. The man who replaces Sasso in the Republican-heavy district: Steve Crisafulli.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic U.S. Rep.-elect Suzanne Kosmas addressed supporters in New Smyrna Beach following her overwhelming victory over three-term Rep. Tom Feeney in a central Florida district smack in the I-4 corridor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, I commit to you that I will be an independent voice in Washington focused on the people of this district -- not on any political party,&quot; Kosmas said, according to a text released by her campaign. &quot;I believe that we won this race because voters, whether Democrat, Republican or Independent, have placed their faith in this common-sense, bi-partisan commitment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kosmas, a Realtor and former state House member, will be one of up to four new faces in the state's 25-member House delegation. Feeney's fellow Orlando-area Republican, Ric Keller, also conceded defeat, to Democrat Alan Grayson. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all those people out waving campaign signs were eager volunteers pushing candidates they believed in Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just a job for me,&quot; said Lamar Graham, one of four men holding anti-Obama signs at East Bay Drive and Belcher Road. &quot;I've already put in my vote for Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graham, 20, and the three others were day laborers with Able Body Labor, a temporary staffing agency headquartered in Largo and with an office in Clearwater. They were paid minimum wage to stand from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. and hold the signs that encourage folks to vote for the Republican nominee John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four were among an undetermined number of day laborers placed at high-traffic corners throughout North Pinellas County. A worker at Able Body Labor's Largo office declined to comment on the day laborers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The signs featured Democratic nominee Barack Obama's name circled in red with a slash through it similar to symbol used in the Ghostbusters' movies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beneath the circle was a warning that Obama wanted to &quot;distribute your wealth to those who haven't earned it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One sign holder who didn't want to be identified said: &quot;I'm just getting paid to do it and I don't have any opinions on what the sign says. I'm just doing it for the bucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late night on Amendment 2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's still very early. But the state is reporting 62% in favor of Amendment 2, which bans gay marriage in the state constitution. But it's not saying which precincts are reporting. The amendment needs 60% to pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A look at Tampa Bay counties shows it's going to be very close. In Pinellas, where Gov. Charlie Crist voted for it, it fails at 54%. In Pasco, it passes at 63%. In Hillsborough, it passes at 62%. In Orange, it's just at 60%. In Palm Beach, early reports have it at 50%.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does Pasco hold a clue for Obama?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unofficial vote is quickly coming into view in Pasco and while Barack Obama is down, he may find some encouragement in this bellwether county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 96 percent of the precincts reporting, John McCain leads 50 percent to 48 percent, or roughly 5,700 votes. But consider that four years ago, George Bush won by 20,000 votes, a victory that drew national attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unofficial analysis of early voting returns showed Obama picked up more of the independent vote in Pasco.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign is spreading misinformation about voting irregularities in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At issue: A campaign news release with an all-caps headline, &quot;ELECTION DAY IRREGULARITIES IN BATTLEGROUND STATES.&quot; It cites a CNN blog (http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/11/04/undervotes-reported-in-florida/) that says ballots are being rejected because people are not filling out a page with constitutional amendments. That is true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the campaign omitted the amendment part and added this line to the blog summary: &quot;In Palm Beach County, FL, Many Voters Are Reporting Trouble Locating The McCain-Palin Ticket On The Ballot Because It Appears On The Second Page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's absolutely erroneous,&quot; Palm Beach elections official Robert Weiner told the Buzz. &quot;McCain-Palin is No. 1 on the first page.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN blog:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West Palm Beach (CNN) - Florida's Palm Beach County is reporting problems at a couple of polling stations: so-called &quot;undervotes,&quot; where machines reject ballots because some voters are not filling out the second page of the ballot, a spokesman for the county Board of Elections confirmed. The page contains proposed amendments to the Florida Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman said these undervotes are legal. The scanner spits the ballot back and reminds the voter to vote on the second page, the spokesman said, adding that the voter then has the choice of voting or registering the undervote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in some cases people simply forget to fill out the second page, but most voters seem to be intentionally skipping that part of the ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The town of Palm Beach is also reporting minor sporadic voter machine failures, the spokesman said. A handful of machines had to be replaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One polling station in the county opened one hour late because of a problem with their precinct voting list.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">College campuses are turning into a real hot spot for problems with long lines, according to Ben Wilcox of Common Cause in a conference call with reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As our sister blog Bay Buzz (http://blogs.tampabay.com/baybuzz/2008/11/few-machines-me.html#more) has reported, voters at the University of South Florida campus in Tampa were waiting 2-1/2 hours to cast their ballots, prompting Hillsborough County's supervisor of elections to dispatch 10 more voting booths. And the wait times at the University of Central Florida exceed three hours, even though the elections office has increased the number of privacy booths there from 12 to 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orange elections spokeswoman Kathy Pierson said despite the long lines, students are waiting their turn. &quot;Everybody is very patient and passionate about their vote,&quot; Pierson said. &quot;We're expecting a turnout in excess of 85 percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Divining voter intent on those absentees </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a scene being repeated in all 67 Florida counties, county canvassing boards are examining thousands of absentee ballots to determine voter intent, then re-creating the voter's choices on a separate ballot. That's necessary so the duplicate ballot can be read by a ballot scanner and counted as a valid vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tallahassee, the Leon County Canvassing Board has already met twice and reviewed 246 re-created absentees (out of more than 26,000 cast county-wide). The board has at least two more meetings scheduled on Election Day. At left, Supervisor of Elections Ion Sancho displays a ballot in which a voter filled in the oval next to Barack Obama's name and also bubbled in the write-in line for president and wrote in Obama's name as well. That was counted as a vote for Obama because the voter intent is clear, and the ballot reflects only one choice for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other ballots weren't so clear. At least two voters wrote in &quot;Mickey Faust&quot; for president. One voter voted for all presidential candidates but one. One ballot that crossed two ovals was thrown out. It's a slow and tedious process. &quot;This is more fun at midnight,&quot; Sancho said. </SPAN></P>

In Tallahassee, it was a $1,200 buy for about 30 spots, scattered throughout five Clear Channel stations. Orlando had less available, unsure of figures just yet. They also bought another 12 spots on the Florida News Network, a statewide radio network (see their stations here (http://www.fnnonline.net/fnn/files/List%20News%20Affiliates.pdf)) , for $820 a piece, or $9,840 total.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voting across Florida is off to a smooth start, Secretary of State Kurt Browning said Tuesday morning, with only a couple of early morning miscues. He said one precinct in Palm Beach County opened an hour late because a precinct clerk insisted on finishing paperwork before unlocking the doors. Some voters were turned away as a result, he said, but &quot;that situation was quickly rectified.&quot; In one Leon County precinct, a late opening was the result of locks being changed on a building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are ready,&quot; Browning said. There were scattered reports of lines, but he said waits were no more than about 20 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Pasco County election supervisor said he did not foresee a very late night awaiting returns, because ballots are counted as they are cast at the nearly 7,000 precincts across the state. But if many returns are still not in by 10 p.m., he'll &quot;start pacing the floor.&quot; Browning said returns on the state Web site may take a little longer to post because some counties prefer to put the numbers on their own Web sites first. Counties are required to send their results to the state by 11:59 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browning urged voters who see problems or have questions can call their county supervisor of elections or the state voter assistance hot line, at 1-866-308-6739. The line received about 350 calls by about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a Browning press briefing Monday, an alarm began wailing. Tuesday, as he spoke, a loud construction noise made Browning difficult to hear. &quot;I apologize,&quot; he said. &quot;As long as we have problems here and nowhere else, it's all right.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding Saturday's front page: I cannot believe anyone would be remotely interested in hearing the 911 call made during someone's most horrific nightmare come true (&quot;Mother, Her 3 Sons Discovered Dead&quot;). Our city would be better served by attending a sporting event to see people at their finest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, it was with great sadness and pride that I attended Friday night's football game between Plant and Chamberlain. While two great football teams were battling on the field, there was a bigger battle being waged in the stands. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Plant fans in the bleachers - and medical personnel - were performing CPR on a gentleman attending the game, the entire Plant side could be heard reciting the Lord's Prayer, praying the gentleman would be taken care of by the One who could help. I read nothing of this in Saturday's paper, and I am quite sure Tampa could be better served by hearing people pulling together to help one in need the only way they could, rather than preying on someone else's horror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where is the humanity? We keep hearing &quot;our country needs change,&quot; so let's start where it matters - in everyday life. I am still at odds as to whether I would have wanted my children to have been in the stands to witness humanity at its finest or simply thankful they were off enjoying Halloween festivities, preventing them from witnessing something so distressing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the football teams on the field, they behaved in a manor befitting young men destined for greatness. My thoughts and prayers go to the gentleman's family.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slim-Fast Campaign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that this election cycle has ended, it is time to evaluate the election process and the wear and tear on American citizens. This cycle has lasted almost two years. It proved to be the most expensive election in U.S. history and the most tiresome. This campaign trend cannot continue unchecked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is impossible for elected officials to do the job they were elected to and run for office during an expanded campaign season. Some would argue it is better for the elected officials to be out campaigning since they do less damage to society when they are not legislating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't have all the answers, but campaign funding, primaries and length of campaigns need to be put on a diet. Group the primaries. Limit campaigns to 30 or 60 days prior to a primary, and limit the barrage of spending by candidates, PACs and public or private entities. Citizens need relief now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ExxonMobil posted a third-quarter profit of $14.83 billion. Please understand we are talking about profit/net income, not gross revenue. This amount represents a 58 percent increase compared to the same period last year. Gross revenue for the third quarter was $137.7 billion, up 35 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They accomplished this while reducing production 8 percent compared to the same period last year. While all Americans were struggling with $4-a-gallon gasoline, this great American corporation was applying the great American shaft to all of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't get me wrong. They were not alone. Chevron and ConocoPhillips reported comparable increases. ExxonMobil is the largest, so I believe they should be the target. What can we do? Immediately begin to boycott all Exxon brands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ongoing boycott of the largest villain, I believe, is more effective than not buying gas for one day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sam Rashid's analysis of the current political climate is the best one we have seen this political season. Personally, it brings memories of the similar situation in 1959, when Cubans were delighted to get rid of seven years of dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like it now appears in this country, the young university students and the middle class were instrumental on achieving that change. Unfortunately, the net result of that change was to trade seven years of dictatorship for 50 years, and counting, of another one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is interesting that Jimmy Carter has held a very low profile during this campaign. After all, Carter is the Bush of the Democratic party, and obviously their operatives have done a great job of keeping him out of sight.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undecided With Cause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday on television, Tribune columnist Daniel Ruth wondered how anyone could still be an undecided voter. &quot;Just make up your mind,&quot; he said. Well, I can tell Daniel why there are still undecideds and why it is difficult for them to &quot;make up their minds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are not part of the Democratic or Republican extreme, you are probably worried about both McCain and Obama and their positions on many issues - and for good reason. Trying to decide who will do the least damage to the country after being elected is not an easy thing to do. History shows us that avoiding the worst candidate is perhaps more important than selecting the best.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lots of people love to complain about the large amounts of money spent on political campaigns. They never mention this money is spent entirely in America, mostly at American small businesses. It keeps money moving. If money doesn't move, economies don't work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps candidates should be allowed to receive donations from overseas. That money also would be spent in America. What a wonderful way to reduce the foreign trade deficit!</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a year ago you'd told Melanie Lee's senior government students that they'd wait in line for two hours on a record cold day in October, they'd have guessed concert tickets were on sale. And for tickets, they could stay under the covers and buy them online. But that was before many of them turned 18, before the economy plummeted, threatening their hopes for college loans or well-paying jobs, and before the Obama- McCain election took hold of young would-be voters in a way teachers say they haven't seen before. Schools around the county are responding to the unusual interest in politics with mock elections, presidential debates and field trips, like the one Lee's students at Palm Beach Lakes High took to an early voting site.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This time around, I just feel the level of discourse in this campaign. I think it's raising the interest level among young people,&quot; said Brad Schutzman, a social studies teacher at Conniston Middle School, where students ran a school-wide election with some help from the adults. &quot;They hear big millennial ideas. That's what appeals to kids. They get the big ideas. They don't get the little stuff.&quot; Those big ideas drove record numbers of young people around the country to register and to vote in the primaries. In Palm Beach County, about 4,000 signed up during voter registration drives held at high schools this year. Since the last presidential election, registration in the nation's largest tossup state jumped 6.5 percent among those under 35 to 3.1 million, eclipsing voters 65 and older, who dropped to 2.9 million. Carlos Pabon Jr. is one of those newly registered. He was among 40 Palm Beach Lakes High 18-yearolds who piled onto a school bus last week to exercise their newly acquired right to vote. He cast his ballot for Barack Obama. &quot;This year we're making history whoever you vote for because there'll be a woman in office (as vice president) or an African-American,&quot; he said. Students not yet 18 aren't allowing age to keep them out of the electoral process. Chris Fernandez, 17, a senior at Saint Andrew's School in Boca Raton, planned to spend his weekend making calls on behalf of John McCain, whom he calls the &quot;right man for the job.&quot; Even middle and elementary school students are paying close attention to the issues this election. The economy was on the mind of Jennifer Milian, a sixth-grader at Conniston Middle in West Palm Beach. &quot;If my mom wasn't paying so much taxes and it went down for her, she wouldn't be complaining so much when I ask for something,&quot; she said. Some schools have created elaborate election lessons to give students a place to plant their electoral passions. Students at Grandview Preparatory School in Boca Raton spent the last six weeks acting as a candidate, a campaign worker, a journalist or a foreign affairs, environmental or economic expert. Each campaign was given a budget and forced to make decisions, such as whether to spend $500,000 to place an ad in the cafeteria, where it would get maximum exposure. At Saint Andrew's School, 15-year-old Jeff Nadel is so convinced that young people want their say that he founded a chapter of a national organization to change the voting age to 16. &quot;Young people recognize that all of these issues and the decisions that are being made today, whether it's in regard to the environment or Social Security or the economy, it's going to affect the youth so much longer,&quot; he said. The real question of this year's election is whether young people's excitement will translate on Tuesday. Young voters seem to have the same attention span for politics that they have for the newest track on their iPod. Only 66 percent called themselves certain to vote, compared with 90 percent of all voters, in a new NBC-Wall Street Journal-MySpace poll. Not so for newly registered voter Sabrina Adolphin. On Tuesday, after two hours in line, she fed her completed ballot into the machine at the Military Trail polling place. Poll workers erupted into applause, a tradition for first-time voters. &quot;I'm ready to do it again,&quot; Adolphin beamed. ~ laura_green@pbpost.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What students are saying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mia Montano, 10 Palm Beach Gardens Elementary Supports: McCain ?He's not for abortion, he has experience in the military, he knows a lot of things that other people wouldn't know. He was captured as a prisoner, how much more do you need?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jermaine Leeks, 11 Palm Beach Gardens Elementary Supports: Obama ?He's my color. It'll be history if he does become president. ? He will bring the people in Iraq back. My cousin is in the war in Iraq. If he dies, I'm going to be really mad.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cassandra Monaco, 12 Wellington Landings Middle School Supports: McCain ?He has more experience then Barack Obama does. I really like his ideas to cut taxes for bigger businesses so he can offer more job opportunities. I think Sarah Palin really knows our country.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Gallego, 12 Wellington Landings Middle School Supports: Obama ?I think he can help us in the economy. McCain is older and he doesn't look like he can help us much. Obama has more experience. He'll help us get through this.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erik Littlefield, 13 Carver Middle School Supports: McCain ?I find McCain's plan better. Barack Obama wants to take soldiers out of Iraq. We're winning the war, what would be the point to take us out? Other countries would see us as a weak nation.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashely Weatherspoon, 13 Carver Middle School Supports: Obama ?I feel he can make our economy a better place. He's trying to give tax breaks to everyday people and McCain is trying to help the rich. ? There's something about the power in his voice. I really have to listen.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who could have predicted that in a World Series battle between a Red team (Phillies) and a Blue team (Rays), one presidential candidate would delay the deciding game to spread his message, while his opponent promised that, if elected, he'd never let politics stand in the way of a good ballgame? Who would have envisioned the country's First Hockey Mom hearing a smattering of boos while dropping the first puck at an NHL game, while her counterpart for the vice presidency bungled the nickname of Tampa Bay's baseball team? And who expected some of the NBA's biggest stars, including Dwyane Wade and LeBron James, throwing their stylish hats into the political fray, while in NFL locker rooms, political debates reached the point that Cleveland Browns coach Romeo Crennel warned players to keep it civilized so that they wouldn't lose their focus on football? You know Tuesday's presidential showdown between Barack Obama and John McCain has reached historic proportions when it permeates the seemingly impenetrable walls of locker rooms, tearing athletes away from ESPN to catch CNN (for a few minutes, anyway). &quot;You'd be a fool not to pay attention,&quot; said Dolphins cornerback Nathan Jones, who calls this election &quot;one for the ages.&quot; Ageless is more like it, because even college athletes are paying attention.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Gators linebacker Brandon Spikes often wears an Obama shirt, and when the sight of it reaches across the aisle to the offensive side of the locker room, it triggers a hearty retort from quarterback Tim Tebow. Meanwhile, Jonathan Phillips, a kicker from Wellington, said for true entertainment, check out the offensive line's meeting room, &quot;where it gets really ridiculous and there's a lot of screaming going on.&quot; If this is what's meant by electoral college, that's fine with UF coach Urban Meyer. &quot;I love when our guys talk about that stuff,&quot; he said. &quot;I just think that's great and that's very mature. When I was 18 years old, that wasn't at the top of my list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some remain mum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Predictably, many sports figures are reluctant to reveal their allegiances, afraid they'll lose endorsements or fans. But many have openly aligned themselves with Obama (Wade, Alonzo Mourning, Shawn Marion, Charles Barkley) or McCain (Curt Schilling, John Elway, Richard Petty, the Florida Panthers' David Booth). Good luck figuring out the allegiances of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Heat owner Micky Arison and boxing promoter Don King, who according to donation records have made campaign contributions to both Republicans and Democrats during the years. Traditional politics were measured by those leaning to the left or the right, but this election also revolves around the center ? specifically, the Heat's Mourning, who helped spread a &quot;Get Out and Vote&quot; message to several Florida colleges, including UM. The line between sports and politics is further blurred by Obama bombarding NFL fans with commercials and buying space on EA Sports video games. He and McCain are planning a last-ditch satellite interview during tonight's Redskins- Steelers game in ? talk about coincidences ? Washington. Mourning, who gave $25,000 to the Democrats in '04, didn't always have such political interest. &quot;When I was in college, I didn't realize the power I had to vote,&quot; said Mourning, who attended Georgetown. &quot;I didn't understand the history behind voting. I didn't understand 40 years ago right here in the state of Florida it was virtually impossible, it was very difficult, for an African- American to register to vote. &quot;Out of respect to my parents and grandparents who suffered and went through all of that, it would be a disservice to them if I didn't do this.&quot; Former Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman once said that in his dozen NFL seasons, he could count on one hand the number of teammates interested in such real-world matters. Today, those discussions aren't hard to find at the Dolphins' camp in Davie. &quot;Politics, religion,&quot; defensive end Vonnie Holliday said, &quot;those are things you don't really talk about too much. But this is a year where guys are talking and guys are aware.&quot; Holliday is an Obama supporter who is happy he can tell his 3-year-old son that he, too, can be president one day. Holliday also looks at Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin and tells his daughter, 8, that similar opportunities await. In any other year, Holliday adds, he might back McCain, who &quot;has a great platform.&quot; Not every athlete is so forthcoming with his political views, instead following the lead of a Michael Jordan, who remained apolitical. Financially, that might be wise. &quot;I would always caution players against talking about what they're going to do behind the drapery when they pull the lever,&quot; said California-based agent Gary Wichard, whose clients include Jason Taylor. &quot;I think it's somebody's own personal opinion. If people love a player because he's sacking a quarterback or throwing a touchdown or Dancing with the Stars, let them love them for that. Don't bring personal issues into it. You just don't have that interaction one-onone to explain yourself.&quot; That explains athletes such as Dolphins rookie guard Donald Thomas, who earned a political science degree at UConn and now makes a science of being politically correct. Who's getting Thomas' vote? &quot;Oh, man,&quot; said Thomas, on injured reserve with a foot injury. &quot;I've always been told to keep my party alliance private, so I'm not going to speak on it. But I am for a change, I'll put it like that, so you can decipher it how you want to.&quot; Players fret tax hikes Fullback Casey Cramer prides himself in talking politics without hinting about his choice. &quot;Who do you think I'm going to vote for?&quot; Cramer asks a reporter after several minutes of grilling. Problem was, he offered zero clues. &quot;I'm giving you nothin'!&quot; he said. If he did, coach Tony Sparano wouldn't mind. Sparano said he never asked players to suppress political views because &quot;they're entitled to their own opinions.&quot; Sparano's opinions revolve more around a 4-3 defense than national defense. &quot;Me, I've got a little more of a one-track mind,&quot; he said. An informal poll in the Dolphins' locker room points to Cramer, from Dartmouth, as a player teammates envision going into politics someday. &quot;Would I love to be in office?&quot; Cramer said. &quot;I would love it. Would I love to have to do the things to get into office? No.&quot; That's what bothers the Panthers' Booth about this election. &quot;It seems like everybody, instead of saying what their campaign is going to do, is just saying what the other campaign is not going to do,&quot; said Booth, a Detroit native. Panthers defenseman Noah Welch was a politics major at Harvard, meaning he attended Obama's alma mater and is leaning toward supporting him. But Welch does play a sport Palin has been pushing. &quot;She's always saying she's a hockey mom,&quot; Welch said, smiling as he adds, &quot;It started off pretty cool but she's used it a lot in her speeches. I think she's got to switch that up a little bit. If any more people hear about it, they might start hating hockey.&quot; One issue prominent in the minds of Wichard's clients is how Obama's tax plan would affect them. &quot;They all talked to me: ?Man, we're going to get killed with Obama's tax increase,' '' Wichard said. Which is good news for McCain ? in some cases. &quot;I'm one of the guys in this world that's going to get hit,&quot; Wade said. He nonetheless supports Obama, saying, &quot;It's not about that. It's about bettering our world.&quot; The Dolphins' Jones agrees. &quot;You have a lot of guys who have come from one lifestyle ? maybe they came from a lower income ? and maybe now you have money, so that poses a conflict in your head,&quot; Jones said. &quot;In this election you've got a party that's kind of for the middle class and you've got another party that's kind of for the rich, so which one do you go with? Well, I'm kind of rich now, but I wasn't rich and I may not always be rich.&quot; Adds Marion, who attended an Obama fund-raiser on Miami Beach: &quot;A lot of people are probably Republicans with their money and Democrats with everything else.&quot; Post staff writers Edgar Thompson, Chris Perkins and Ben Volin and correspondent Chuck King contributed to this story. ~hal_habib@pbpost.com</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a political science professor, I've been dismayed by the emotional charges of &quot;socialist&quot; and &quot;communist&quot; in the presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What readers should know is that almost every advanced democracy in the world offers its citizens a range of benefits: guaranteed health insurance or health care, guaranteed sick leave and vacation time, heavily subsidized higher education and more. Offering these benefits does not make these countries less &quot;democratic&quot; - democracy being defined as a freely elected government that adheres to the rule of law. Some market-oriented economies have been quite authoritarian, and some democracies have had considerable government intervention in the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What many do not realize is that the United States is the major democratic outlier when it comes to welfare benefits. Almost every industrialized democracy in the world - including our closest allies, such as Israel, Britain, Australia and Japan - offers considerably more welfare benefits than any politician has ever dared to offer in the United States. For example, Barack Obama has discussed a government-sponsored health insurance program; in Israel, they have a mandatory health insurance program that would be sure to leave American conservatives fuming. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not advocating for any particular system - each system has its costs and benefits. But it's important to recognize that offering government-sponsored health insurance will not turn America &quot;communist&quot; - that is, unless you want to call Israel and Japan and Australia communist as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maria Rost Rublee, Ph.D., assistant professor, University of Tampa, Oldsmar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationalized health carewould be too costly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a U.K. citizen by birth and American by choice, I don't understand why nationalized health care would be good for America. The cost would impoverish our country and reduce the standard of health care the vast majority of Americans receive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To continue receiving health care benefits in the United Kingdom, British citizens pay income tax, national insurance tax, value added tax (17.5 percent), capital gains tax, capital gains inheritance tax and stamp duty. And no, they don't get free prescriptions - $11 is the cost for working people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than leave themselves at the mercy of the overwhelmed and underfunded National Health Service, several of my relatives pay out of their own pockets for additional health insurance coverage of $150 or more per month. Don't forget, the very poor, retired, blind and disabled already receive government-funded (paid for with your tax dollars) health care in America. The &quot;47-million uninsured&quot; comprise, among others, healthy young people who don't feel the need for insurance and a large number of illegal immigrants. The federal government has an insatiable appetite for your tax dollars, and a nationalized health care system would be an endless gravy train for Congress.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A prescription for boldness - Oct. 21, editorial on health care</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A system unprepared</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps it's just as well that health care coverage for all develops slowly. If it were started tomorrow, there would not be enough primary-care physicians to care for all the people seeking attention, since the more recent medical graduates have abdicated their responsibility for primary care to foreign medical graduates and osteopaths because of economic and lifestyle considerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not simply a matter of insurance coverage. The entire medical nonsystem has to change, including real attention to decreasing costs, perhaps aided by tort reform, producing enough of the proper types of physicians to meet patient needs. This also includes improvement in quality of care, controlling the costs of medical education, changing physician reimbursement, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, change medicine back to a profession rather than a business. Good luck!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurance roulette</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report about Medicare omitted a significant consideration: All insurance is a &quot;bet,&quot; a gamble if you will. The insurance companies are betting they will take in more in premiums than they will have to pay out. You are betting they will pay out more in claims than you pay in premiums. They have actuarial tables that statistically prove they will win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's kind of like Las Vegas but not as much fun. They depend on your fear that you will lose more than you can afford. Good luck with that bet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ID is accessible</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My late wife wasn't able to drive, but upon going to the bank she showed a Social Security card and was told by the teller that she didn't exist just by means of that. Then we went to the motor vehicles department and paid $15 for a nondriver's photo ID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do these folks, if they have Social Security or SSI checks deposited in a bank, withdraw funds from the bank without ID? They must find the means to get to the store to meet their needs, so why can't they get out for a photo ID?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the state should create a mobile photo ID van and give these folks a free ID at their house.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Obama's Spanish ad an effort to deceive?Oct. 31</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaching out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I first read the implied criticism of Sen. Barack Obama's effort, I thought it was because his lips moved but the Spanish was dubbed in. Upon discovering that he actually spoke, I was incredulous that anyone would imply that making such an effort was deceptive. But then we're talking about Republican strategists here, who seem to exalt being the party of &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a former Peace Corps volunteer who speaks two Asian languages, I understand why Henry de la Torre responds as he does (&quot;It's a courtesy he's showing us&quot;). It exemplifies, as Obama's campaign strives to do, reaching out to connect with people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During my Thailand Peace Corps tour, natives were equally impressed that an American would take the trouble to learn their language. As Obama apparently is, I was blessed with the ability to pronounce clearly, which generates a warm response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe John McCain and Sarah Palin think it's &quot;unpatriotic&quot; to speak anything but English (I know Jeb Bush didn't). If not, I suggest they starting cramming on a Berlitz course; maybe they can sneak in a message before the election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Storck is quoted as saying of the volunteer, &quot;This is an elderly gentleman, and he was simply making a comment.&quot; The reported age of the volunteer: 72. Hmm.</SPAN></P>

If you haven't been paying attention, or maybe you simply don't believe what you hear in the litany of TV ads, here's a last-minute primer on the key planks of each candidate's economic plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supported Bush administration's $700-billion plan to buy troubled securities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates reduction of corporate taxes to spur economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proposes new $300-billion plan for the government to buy subprime mortgages and convert them to fixed-rate mortgages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proposes a suspension on rules that say people age 701/2 must begin cashing in retirement accounts, so they may avoid locking in recent losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wants to eliminate taxes on unemployment benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will guarantee all savings, beyond normal limits, for six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Favors cutting the capital gains tax by half, to 7.5 percent, for two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supported Bush administration's $700-billion plan to buy troubled securities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Offers a $500 tax credit to workers; will raise taxes on singles who make $200,000 or more and couples who make more than $250,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Favors a temporary $3,000 tax credit to businesses for each new job created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will temporarily allow people to withdraw up to 15 percent of their retirement money, to a maximum of $10,000, without penalty. (Normal taxes apply.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Favors mandatory 90-day freeze on some foreclosures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wants the federal government to lend money to state and local governments in need of credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Source: PolitiFact.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Straight talk on bailout, economic future</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John B. Jung Jr. was in the bay area last week, and the senior managing director of BB&amp;T Capital was not shy about tackling some thorny issues about our struggling economy, patchwork financial bailout and where we're heading. North Carolina's BB&amp;Tis prominent in the Tampa Bay area. It has remained relatively untouched by the stock market and balance-sheet tsunami that has laid waste to so many financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jung told an audience at the St. Petersburg Yacht Club that the U.S. economy came closer last month than many people realize to the brink of meltdown. So he appreciated the extraordinary efforts by the federal government to add liquidity, bolster sagging bank capital, guarantee money market funds and ease widespread panic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jung also raised intriguing questions about the ongoing bailout. Among them:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Was the cheap sale of Wall Street's Bear Stearns just a $50-billion gift to buyer JPMorgan Chase?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Was the sale of Washington Mutual (again, sold to JPMorgan Chase) just another way to prevent the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. from getting stuck with the failure of an institution too big to handle?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Was the decision to let Lehman Bros. fail an arbitrary test to see what would happen if a Wall Street firm was not bailed out?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jung's remarks were refreshing because he posed questions most people still are not willing to ask. He also criticized the country's political leaders for lacking the nerve and discipline to focus on longer-term challenges. For example, just because gas prices have dipped, is that reason to stop the critical national debate about energy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hidden message in much of Jung's remarks? Prepare for a great deleveraging. Prices on many things may fall from their recent heights, he warned, and that will need to be reflected, in turn, with cuts in costs, including wages. Ultimately, that's not necessarily bad, he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Supporters roar and sing for Obama, stay up late for McCain. Biden races through.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They wore Hawaiian shirts and flip-flops and clutched foot-tall margaritas, but this was a different kind of concert for Jimmy Buffett fans Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one, it was free. And for another, even the parrots on their heads wore Obama pins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel a volcano of change,&quot; said Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa. &quot;You can hear it on the 'Coconut Telegraph.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They roared. The name of the rally? &quot;Last Chance for Change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Election Day closes in, Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain are clawing for Florida's 27 electoral votes, staging a flurry of personal appearances and sending big-name stand-ins like Jimmy Buffett when they can't be here themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain held a midnight rally Sunday and will be in Tampa first thing this morning. Obama is in Jacksonville today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The equation is a simple one. Obama can reach the magic 270 electoral votes even if he doesn't carry Florida, but McCain cannot. So for McCain the late, hard push to win Florida is about survival; for Obama it is about reaching checkmate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Chroman, who spent the week volunteering for Obama, took a break in the stands of the Ford Amphitheatre in Tampa for Sunday's free Buffett concert. He was among about 15,000 who showed up for the free show that ran a full hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wore a tie-dye shirt, and said he understood why Buffett would support Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They both stand for positivity,&quot; he said. &quot;Jimmy is one of the most optimistic people I've ever seen. Obama's call for hope rings a similar tune.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Cameron from Brandon sang a different song. As an outnumbered McCain fan, he came strictly for the music, and said he'd ignore the politics. &quot;I still like Jimmy Buffett,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain isn't going it alone in Florida. At Square One Burgers in South Tampa earlier in the day, about 225 people turned out to see former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them were New Jersey residents Carl Ceragno and A.J. O'Connor, who happened to be in town. They hadn't been to any McCain rallies yet, but didn't want to miss a chance to see their Northeast neighbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We really wish he could've stayed in the running,&quot; Ceragno said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we love McCain, too,&quot; O'Connor quickly added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani walked through the standing-room-only restaurant crowd to cheers of &quot;Ru-dy! Ru-dy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani got serious. He said polls that show Obama in the lead are &quot;just trying to psych you out,&quot; and he said he expects McCain to pull off &quot;the greatest comeback victory&quot; in history. &quot;Right now,&quot; he told the crowd, &quot;we need John McCain more than he needs us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He brought up remarks by Obama's running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, who recently told supporters that Obama would be tested by a foreign crisis soon after coming into office. Giuliani suggested that might be good reason to elect somebody else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody tested Dwight Eisenhower. Nobody tested Ronald Reagan,&quot; Giuliani said. &quot;Nobody with half a brain is going to test John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a three-stop swing across North Florida, Biden focused on the economy. He spoke to a crowd of more than 1,000 at Langford Green at Florida State University in Tallahassee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He borrowed the old Reagan campaign slogan - &quot;Are you better off today than you were four years ago?&quot; but offered it with a twist: &quot;Democrats and Republicans know we're not better off,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden talked about the &quot;longest walk a parent can take&quot; being the walk up the flight of stairs into their child's bedroom to tell them they're going to have change schools because a parent has lost a job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, if we can help Wall Street, we should be able to help Monroe Street,&quot; said Sen. Biden, referring to one of Tallahassee's main commercial arteries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden drew comparisons between McCain and President Bush, pointing out how McCain said on Meet the Press last week that he and Bush &quot;share a common philosophy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't call yourself a maverick if all you've been in the last eight years is a sidekick,&quot; Biden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida State and Florida A&amp;M university students packed the speech, which also drew a couple of dozen student protesters who chanted &quot;John McCain&quot; and made siren noises throughout Biden's speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're witnessing history right now,&quot; said Florida A&amp;M junior Antonio Rosado, 23, who voted for Obama and Biden on Thursday. &quot;Obama is the best candidate for the economy. It won't change right away, but he's the best person to jump-start it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA - A proposed Sangria's restaurant in Seminole Heights needs approval from the city's Architectural Review Commission before its owners can remodel and enlarge a former auto repair shop.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when Tony Pashos was an obscure lineman buried on the Baltimore Ravens' depth chart in 2004, the 325-pound offensive tackle couldn't resist starting a political conversation with any teammate willing to listen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Pashos] is the type of person who's always arguing and debating somebody about something, and he really likes stirring it up with people about politics,&quot; said retired Ravens linebacker Peter Boulware, a former All-American at Florida State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With another presidential election being decided Tuesday, Pashos, now with the Jaguars, has been more vocal than ever, trumpeting Republican candidate John McCain to many teammates who favor Democratic nominee Barack Obama in a politically divided locker room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes, the discussions with Obama supporters such as defensive end Reggie Hayward and running back Fred Taylor can get animated, but Pashos likes it that way. He welcomes the point-counterpoint challenge. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fred [Taylor] does a great job of [arguing] because he's an Obama guy, and we sit down after hours and hash out both sides,&quot; Pashos said. &quot;We go on and on. Even though I'm not voting for Obama, I love the fact he's young and fresh and has made a lot more people aware and wanting to learn [about issues].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Hayward: &quot;With Tony, sometimes [election conversation] is an argument, sometimes it's a debate. We have fun with it, but no hard feelings. It's a good thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pashos views the 2008 election as more than just a chance to share his philosophy on different issues. It's also an opportunity to test himself for his post-NFL career, where he's strongly leaning toward attending law school as a precursor to entering the political arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It goes to my nature of wanting to help out and give time to help people in need,&quot; said Pashos, whose Pashos Pals program takes foster-care kids on monthly trips through the 4th Judicial Guardian Ad Litem system. &quot;I feel in politics right now, there aren't as many people looking out for the little guy. I like to be the guy stirring the pot and getting things done. I'd like to go [into politics] and make an impact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Football has been a segue into politics for several ex-NFL players -- Jack Kemp, Steve Largent, Heath Shuler -- and former Canadian Football League quarterback J.C. Watts, all of whom attained fame in sports before being elected to Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boulware, 33, had no inkling to be a politician until he ran into former FSU safety John Davis in early 2007 at an alumni function. Davis knew a Florida House seat in Tallahassee was becoming vacant. He thought Boulware might be a good candidate, and after consulting several friends on both sides of the political aisle, Boulware threw his hat in the ring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Boulware faces Democratic challenger Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, a Tallahassee attorney, for the District 9 seat in the Florida Legislature. The Ravens' all-time sack leader (70) and four-time Pro Bowl pick is trying to become the first Republican to ever be elected from that district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not trying to play up the angle that I'm an expert. I'm just running as someone who wants to serve people,&quot; said Boulware, whose campaign has raised nearly $500,000. &quot;I just want to do a good job. I'm not doing this to launch a political career or become a big-time politician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pashos, who grew up in a fiercely Democratic, low-to-middle class income family outside of Chicago, started leaning more toward a politically conservative view after attending the University of Illinois and graduating with a history degree. Though he's a registered Republican, the 28-year-old doesn't consider his views extreme right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm somebody who likes to know why things are the way they are,&quot; Pashos said. &quot;I want to learn more about certain issues and ideas, see how they affect my life and my family. It started when I was a little kid around the television, watching the news with my dad every night and following elections throughout the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not hard right [wing], and I'm not to the left. I watched both the Democratic and Republican conventions. A lot of it is just a bunch of rah-rah, so you have to go and find the meat of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter how the presidential race turns out, Pashos remains most passionate about education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I was running [for president], I'd say, 'How about finding a way to get the best education, the best schools for kids to give them hope and empower them with knowledge,' &quot; Pashos said. &quot;I believe there needs to be more spending and attention toward education programs. If you give me the same amount of money that they spend on the war [in Iraq], $10 billion a month or whatever, I guarantee you I could impact every major city in this country by building new grammar schools in some of the worst neighborhoods.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KICKER JOSH SCOBEE: &quot;I'm for [John] McCain because I think his policies stand for things that I stand for. [Barack] Obama, on the other hand, is going to bring some things to the table that I don't like, especially taxing 5 percent of Americans. A lot of us [NFL players] happen to fall in that category, and I think it will negatively affect our economy. I don't think it'll help for us to have a mostly Democratic Congress and a Democratic president. I grew up Republican, my whole family is Republican. There's always a couple things in any candidate that you don't like, but with McCain, the good things outweigh the bad things.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEFENSIVE END REGGIE HAYWARD: &quot;I'm not a big advocate of the war [in Iraq]. I support my troops 100 percent, but when we have an opportunity to bring troops home and save lives, I'm 100 percent for that. [John] McCain may have an exit strategy. I just don't know what it is. I feel like [Barack] Obama is giving us a closer exit strategy to get these kids back home, so they can get back in school and living productive lives instead of fighting a war that may not be worth it. I understand there are times that you have to have [war] because some evils are out there you have to take care of. But I think we've been over there for a while and we've done enough. My whole thing is we have enough problems at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HE'S UNDECIDED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUARTERBACK DAVID GARRARD: &quot;I just don't like what either [McCain or Obama] is about. I'm pro-life, and I don't like Obama's stance on that or his stance on spreading the wealth. We still need to take care of people, but you can't just spread the wealth. I think that would put the country in worse economic standing. McCain, I just feel like it's the same old song. Obama doesn't believe in all the things I believe in, but I'd be proud to have him as president because I think it's pretty cool thing to have our first black candidate. I don't have anything against McCain. I'm just so torn, but I'll probably pull the lever for one of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA-More than 125 million Americans will cast ballots in the presidential race by the time polls close Tuesday night, and the final results could once again come down to Florida. So what will the 12 million voters in the Sunshine State decide? It just might be up to you. In Florida, Sens.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama and John McCain have targeted most of their time and resources along the state's traditional cradle of swing voters: the suburbs and towns that pepper the Interstate 4 corridor from Orlando to Tampa. But the most exciting presidential race in a generation-whether the measure is the record television ratings, an astonishing $1 billion in campaign donations or the historic primary turnout - also has raised questions among voting blocs that usually need little persuasion. Will traditional Democratic voters in Palm Beach County's Jewish communities turn out for Obama, despite false Internet rumors that he is Muslim? Will Republican voters in North Florida's Bible Belt pack the polls for McCain, a candidate whose conservative credentials have been repeatedly questioned? Does &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; help McCain win back the thousands of Floridians who now say they trust the Democrat on tax issues? Can Obama capitalize on the 600,000 newly registered Democrats this year - mostly black, Hispanic and young Floridians - and wipe out President Bush's 2004 victory margin in the state of 380,000 votes? Central Florida &quot;It's not about race,&quot; says Marilyn Auer, 78, a Democrat from Melbourne supporting McCain. Auer, who is white, said she voted for every Democratic candidate since Harry Truman in 1948 and would support Hillary Clinton if she were the nominee. But she won't support Obama, the first black nominee for a major party, because &quot;he doesn't have enough experience.&quot; On the western end of the Interstate 4 corridor, Sheila Wiersma, a registered Republican and mother of a 14-yearold, said she's &quot;pretty much decided.&quot; &quot;Obama,&quot; the Plant City resident said. &quot;I think we need a change in Washington. From what I've seen, he has the experience and he understands the issues that affect me in the middle class.&quot; The two women represent many of the unpredictable voters who make up Central Florida's politically fickle Interstate 4 corridor, where voters have become increasingly familiar with the Obama and McCain campaigns. Of the 14 days Obama has campaigned in Florida, he spent part of 12 in Central Florida. McCain has aired more than half of his Florida television commercials in the Orlando and Tampa markets. But to win Florida this year, both candidates also will have to depend on other areas of the state. &quot;The idea that you can look at a state as nuanced as Florida and say this one strip of 150 miles is it, that's oversimplification,&quot; former Democratic Gov. Bob Graham said. South Florida In South Florida, the question is not whether Democrats will win Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties. It's by how much. Recent polls show Obama has shored up support among Jewish voters who preferred Clinton by nearly 4-to-1 in January. But the experts are watching to see whether these voters turn out in the large numbers they have in the past. McCain has dispatched Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., to the area several times, but Obama has countered with Hillary Clinton and Al Gore. Turnout among black voters in South Florida is also a question. More than 500,000 of Florida's black voters stayed home in 2004, but Obama campaign officials said black voters account for 20 percent of the 3.4 million voters in the state who have cast early ballots. &quot;To have a black leader this close to the White House is phenomenal,&quot; said Richard Celestin, 22, a native of Haiti. Celestin has lived in Miami for 10 years, but followed through with plans to become a citizen to vote for Obama. &quot;He's been motivating me,&quot; he said. North Florida Democrats hope motivated black voters will help them win Duval County, the heart of a Jacksonville media market that is roughly the size of the West Palm Beach market. Bush won Duval County in 2000 and 2004 by more than 16 percentage points, but Obama will spend precious time on Monday - the day before the election - to make his third stop of the general election in Jacksonville. &quot;It says a lot when, at this stage in the game, you're campaigning on your opponent's side of the field,&quot; Democratic pollster David Beattie said. The Panhandle also includes pockets of Democrats, such as Leon County, the home of Florida State University, and Gadsden County, the only county in Florida to vote for Walter Mondale against Ronald Reagan in 1984. This area, however, is a stronghold for Republicans, who must come out in droves for McCain to win the state. McCain won most of the Panhandle in the Republican primary, but by close margins. Many conservative voters said they became more excited about the GOP ticket when Sarah Palin was nominated as the vice presidential candidate. &quot;She just energized everyone,&quot; said Joe Rega, a father of nine children who supported Mitt Romney in the primary. &quot;I don't think he could have picked anyone better.&quot; Brett Doster, Bush's Florida campaign manager in 2004, said the Republican base has &quot;come home&quot; for McCain, but the party's legendary turnout machine will be tested in the final days to turn undecided voters. &quot;McCain has ground to make up, no question,&quot; he said. &quot;And that's the big question: Can McCain's blitz over the last 72 hours to the people in the undecided column overcome the motivation in Obama's base?&quot; ~ mike_bender@pbpost.com</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OCALA - Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin rallied three Central Florida cities on Saturday, telling crowds that her ticket was the safe pick on Election Day. &quot;The rousing speeches of our opponent, they can fill a stadium. But they cannot keep our country safe,&quot; Palin said at Sims Park in New Port Richey.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for a season, a man can inspire with words. But for a lifetime, John McCain has inspired us with his deeds.&quot; Democrats accused Palin of resorting to &quot;scare tactics.&quot; &quot;Floridians are tired of the Bush- McCain scare tactics that seek to divide us as a country,&quot; Obama spokesman Bobby Gravitz said. &quot;Obama will never hesitate to defend America, and he will chart a new direction from the failed McCain-Bush economic policies so we are stronger here at home.&quot; Obama's camp has attempted to tie McCain to unpopular President Bush for most of the general election. But McCain did release a new ad Saturday with another Bush. Former Gov. Jeb Bush speaks Spanish directly into the camera for a 30-second ad that will air in the state. According to a translation, Bush tells viewers the choice on Tuesday is between &quot;a president who raises your taxes, or one who defends working families.&quot; In Ocala, Palin painted Obama as a tax-and-spend liberal, despite the Democrat's economic plan that is based on tax cuts for the middle class. She also told the crowd that McCain would balance the federal budget, and its $1 trillion deficit, within four years. However, the campaign's top policy adviser, Doug Holtz-Eakin, told Fox News last week that would be difficult given the recent meltdown of financial markets. &quot;You can trust John Mc- Cain and me to keep our promises, because we're the only candidates in this race who have a track record of reform,&quot; Palin said in Ocala. ~mike_bender@pbpost.com</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI - Hillary Clinton is emerging as a significant player in the final presidential campaign strategies for both Democrats and Republicans in Florida. She campaigned for Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama at a Puerto Rican restaurant here Saturday before heading to the Orlando area for an appearance aimed at Central Florida swing voters.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party of Florida, meanwhile, has sent a four-page mailer to female voters showing GOP nominee John McCain and Clinton together and praising Clinton for leaving &quot;18 million cracks in the glass ceiling.&quot; &quot;Senator Clinton knows how to reach across the aisle to solve problems. Both she and John McCain have shown the American people proven results, not pretty words,&quot; the mailer says. Republican Party of Florida spokeswoman Erin VanSickle said the mailer &quot;reminds women who may have supported Hillary Clinton that John McCain and Sarah Palin will bring opportunity and reform, whereas Barack Obama will hurt women, their families and their businesses by taking more tax dollars out of our purses and redistributing the wealth.&quot; Asked about the mailer Saturday, Clinton imitated a politician's disclaimer at the end of a TV or radio ad: &quot;Well, I'm Hillary Clinton, and I do not approve that message.&quot; U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Pembroke Pines, said she couldn't believe it when she received one of the Republican mailers. &quot;For them to suggest that they embrace Hillary Clinton and think the world of her is outrageous when they've spent decades trying to take the Clintons down,&quot; Wasserman Schultz said. &quot;The voters in Florida are going to see through that.&quot; Clinton was scheduled to appear at a morning rally, but her flight from New York was delayed. Instead, she stopped by the Old San Juan restaurant and spoke to about 150 supporters outside before briefly going inside and shaking hands. The restaurant is in the Little Havana area of Miami, where Cuban-Americans have traditionally given strong support to Republicans. But state Rep. Luis Garcia, the only Cuban-American Democrat in the Florida House, told the crowd the area has changed from Republican red since the 2004 presidential election. &quot;Little Havana went blue two years ago,&quot; Garcia said. Clinton reminded the crowd of her husband's presidency from 1993 to 2001. &quot;You know very well that everybody was so much better off when we had a Democrat in the White House,&quot; she said. ~ george_bennett@pbpost.com</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through Saturday, according to the Democrats' latest tally, 38 percent of all Florida voters have cast ballots -- 4.2-million votes in the bank -- and 331,274 more Democrats have voted than Republicans. Another 710,066 independents have voted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have cast nearly 52 percent of the 2.55-million early votes, and Republicans nearly 31 percent. Republicans have cast about 48 percent of the 1.65-million absentee ballots returned and Democrats about 36 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Btw, early voting was scheduled to end in Pinellas at 4 p.m. A neighbor just told me she drove by the St Pete location and at least 75 people were still waiting to vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rudy Giuliani to reporters moments ago:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to have people in Florida right to the very end because we know how important it is. And we know we have to win Florida, and we will. Everything we see is enormous enthusiasm all through the state of Florida. I think there's a real growing sense that as you get down to the end, John McCain is the right man for the country and the right man for the state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani was joined on a conference call with Sen. Mel Martinez, who declared equal optimism for McCain in the closing moments of the race. &quot;I know what it takes to close in this state is to close strong and I think we are closing strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about robo calls blasting Obama, Martinez said he had heard some from Democrats suggesting that seniors could lose Social Security benefits. That's an old tactic, Martinez said, adding, &quot;I guess we can call that Lawton Chiles style of campaigning.&quot; He quickly qualified his remark to say he was not speaking ill of the dead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of them were New Jersey residents Carl Ceragno and A.J. O'Connor, who happened to be in town.

There's also a couple of dozen McCain supporters about 100 yards away chanting &quot;John McCain, John McCain&quot; and making siren noises.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quote of the week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no doubt in my mind that if Charlie Crist had been picked as the vice presidential nominee, we would not be discussing the closeness of the Sunshine State in this election.&quot; - Florida GOP chairman Jim Greer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meet the winner and winner of the week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winner of the week Florida House Democratic Leader Dan Gelber, D-Miami, is the week's hands-down winner for persuading Republican Gov. Charlie Crist to extend early voting hours in Florida. Gelber, a lawyer, convinced the governor that he had the legal authority to do so, and Crist issued the executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winner of the week II Feeling generous, we won't stamp anyone as a loser this week and instead name Charlie Crist our other winner. Even if McCain loses Florida with an assist from Crist's early voting extension, Crist will come out fine. After all, he needs many of those Florida Obama supporters in his corner for re-election in 2010, and generating some bipartisan good sure helps.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who's winning Fla?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case you missed it, Barack Obama wins the White House if he wins Florida. Two days to go. Where's Florida tilting? More here. (http://www.tampabay.com/news/article885903.ece)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point in 2004, the rolling average of polls compiled by RealClearPolitics.com showed President Bush leading Florida by 0.6 percent. Bush wound up winning by 5 percentage points, despite an unprecedented voter mobilization effort by independently operating Democratic groups. As of Saturday, the average of recent polls showed Obama leading by 4.1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It looked as if Florida was an electoral has-been, disrespected by the national parties for jumping the line with its primary. But we're back. Times Tallahassee Bureau Chief Steve Bousquet reviews our evolution from pariah to powerhouse. Our 27 electoral votes could swing another election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 3, 2007: The Legislature votes to move up the date of Florida's primary to Jan. 29, 2008. Analysis: Now largely forgotten, this was No. 37 on Republican House Speaker Marco Rubio's &quot;100 Innovative Ideas for Florida's Future.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 25: Democratic National Committee votes to strip Florida of all of its convention delegates for scheduling its primary one week before party rules allow. Analysis: A power play by DNC chairman Howard Dean that everyone knew couldn't last, and it didn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sept. 1: All major Democratic presidential candidates boycott Florida because of the state's decision to hold an earlier primary, threatening the state's reputation as a kingmaker in presidential politics. &quot;Selfish,&quot; snaps state Democratic Party chairman Karen Thurman. Analysis: Ignore Florida at your peril.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov. 8: The Republican National Committee votes to strip Florida of half of its delegates for advancing the primary. But all delegates would be restored at the August 2008 convention. Analysis: The response was more muted, but the feelings were hurt just the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov. 28: Eight Republican presidential contenders square off in a CNN/YouTube debate at St. Petersburg's Mahaffey Theater. Analysis: Mike who? Fred who? There was no talking snowman as in a previous YouTube debate, but a questioner waved a Bible and asked candidates if they believed &quot;every word of this book.&quot; CNN said the debate drew a large number of young viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan. 26, 2008: Three days before Florida's critical primary, Gov. Charlie Crist endorses John McCain for president. &quot;I don't think anybody would be better,&quot; Crist says at a Pinellas County Republican dinner. Analysis: Crist's endorsement was worth a few percentage points, enough to deliver Florida for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan. 29: McCain wins the primary in Florida, where Republican voters also deliver a crushing blow to the presidential dreams of Rudy Giuliani, while Democrats clearly favored Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama. The GOP nomination is now McCain's, while cracks are evident in Obama's Florida base. Analysis: Giuliani's post-9/11 message of domestic security didn't fit the times and he picked the wrong state as his firewall. &quot;From hero to zero,&quot; said MSNBC's Keith Olbermann.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 21: Obama ends his nine-month boycott of Florida with a rally at Tampa's St. Pete Times Forum. On a few days' notice he draws 16,000. Not a sellout, but close. Analysis: Obamamania hits Tampa Bay, and not for the last time. But after stiff-arming Florida for so long, the Illinois senator still has a lot of catching up to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 24: The Democratic Party votes to restore all of Florida's 211 convention delegates; less than a week later, the Republicans follow suit. Analysis: Take that, Howard Dean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 29: McCain shocks the political world and picks Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate. That morning, McCain calls Crist, a VP also-ran, to say he decided to &quot;go in a different direction.&quot; Analysis: As later news reports said, McCain's advisers decided he needed a game-changer, but Palin brought a bundle of good and bad to the ticket, and polls showed that she scared away women and independents who are crucial to McCain's hopes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sept. 16: Campaigning in Jacksonville, McCain declares: &quot;I believe, still, the fundamentals of our economy are strong.&quot; The sound bite will reverberate for weeks on cable channels. Analysis: In the middle of the biggest Wall Street collapse since the Great Depression, McCain's words became instant fodder for an Obama attack ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sept. 21: A Sarah Palin rally draws a crowd estimated as high as 60,000 in The Villages, the boomers' mega-retirement community north of Orlando. Analysis: It was Palin at her best, firing up the Republican base while enhancing the reputation of The Villages as the No. 1 Florida destination for GOP candidates (exit 329 off I-75).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sept. 29: In the GOP-leaning Sarasota-Bradenton market, Obama raises $750,000 to McCain's $209,000. &quot;We have far more momentum,&quot; a local Democrat says. Analysis: The Democrats had far more money, too - the reverse of what usually happens in Florida races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sept. 30: State Republican chairman Jim Greer (shown here in June with former Gov. Bob Martinez) calls a meeting of party and McCain staffers that leads to reports of dissension between the camps. A day later, a rolling average of polls shows Obama ahead in Florida for the first time. Analysis: If McCain loses Florida, pundits may point to this as a turning point. If McCain wins Florida, Greer may want to hunt for an olive branch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oct. 19: The state reports that Democrats had a 2-to-1 advantage in registering voters in Florida in 2008 and signed up 657,775 more Democrats than Republicans. Analysis: Democrats have a big advantage in new voter registration in a state with a history of voting for Republican presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today: It's Joe Biden's turn to return to Leon, Alachua and Volusia counties, capping a week that saw visits by McCain, Palin, Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, Joe Lieberman and others. Analysis: They all get it: Florida, Florida, Florida.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Get everybody in your family, anybody that can vote,&quot; comedian Chris Rock exhorted more than 1,000 people at a pro-Barack Obama rally in the College Park area of Tampa. &quot;Get your retarded uncle. Get him to vote. Anybody you know with an arm, bring him down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forty miles north in New Port Richey, at least 5,500 people turned out to see Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin kick off a three-stop tour of Central Florida. And in Miami and Winter Park, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton stumped for Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember, Florida, we're a nation at war. We need somebody who talks about wars that America is fighting, and isn't afraid to use the word victory. We need John McCain,&quot; Palin told the enthusiastic crowd at Sims Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early voting ended Saturday in many Florida counties (except Pinellas, where voting continues today from noon to 4 p.m.), so the campaigns are shifting their emphasis to get every possible vote Tuesday. Polls show a tight race for Florida's 27 electoral votes, and both sides are slicing and dicing the electorate to mobilize their supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why Palin was in Pasco, Polk City and Ocala on Saturday. Stressing familiar Republican themes of limited government, national defense and, especially, taxes, she was working to help win these Republican-leaning areas with similarly big margins as President Bush did in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's why Rock appeared in a heavily African-American neighborhood at a Little League field a couple of blocks from an early voting site. And it's why Clinton, particularly popular with Hispanics, was in Miami and Central Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like we've been in a long, long race and we can see the finish line,&quot; she told a fired-up crowd outside Old San Juan Restaurant in Little Havana. &quot;We can't let anybody stop us or trip us up or divert or distract us. We have to get across that finish line. Everything is at stake that we care about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers handed out stickers that read &quot;Hispanics for Change&quot; and arranged for buses to take people to early voting sites and to canvass neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you have already voted?&quot; Clinton said. A sea of hands shot up amid a roaring cheer. &quot;Well, here's what I want you to do: I want you to make the case for Sen. Obama, and it's not hard to make....</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It took a Democratic president to clean up after the first President Bush. It's going to take a Democratic president to clean up after this President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flood of activity continues today as former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani campaigns for McCain at 9:30 a.m. at Square One Burgers in South Tampa; Joe and Jill Biden hit Tallahassee, Gainesville and Daytona Beach; and Obama supporter Jimmy Buffett holds a free get-out-the-vote concert at the Ford Amphitheatre in Tampa at 3 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, fresh off a Saturday Night Live appearance, is scheduled to hold a rally in Miami after midnight tonight, and then hold a rally outside Raymond James Stadium in Tampa later Monday morning. Obama will campaign in Jacksonville on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave Rodgers, 58, a Republican from Holiday at Palin's rally, discounted the polls showing McCain behind Obama. He said the undecided voters will go for McCain because of questions over the economy and national security, and McCain's experience. Those factors played into his decision to back McCain after the third debate, even though he had planned to sit out the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember back to the 2004 election, we were behind, too,&quot; Rodgers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Mason-Dixon poll released Saturday shows a neck-and-neck race in Florida with Obama leading McCain, 49 percent to 47 percent and 5 percent undecided. That means Florida could come down to whichever side has the stronger voter turnout effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very, very worried. I have never seen people so much as now,&quot; said Laura Vianello, 59, a Republican activist who was waving signs for McCain outside the Cuban restaurant Versailles on Saturday. &quot;Obama is much more organized, and I hate to say that because I'm a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many voters who turned out to see Chris Rock sported &quot;Obama is my president&quot; T-shirts, and many of them said they already had voted. Rock joked during his seven-minute routine about the numerous houses owned by the McCains and said the Republican nominee can't relate to their lives and struggles. &quot;When you go to somebody for help, you want somebody who can relate to what you have to say. Like if I have problems (picking up women), I wouldn't call Brad Pitt because he wouldn't know what I was talking about,&quot; Rock quipped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is hardly the only celebrity working to turn out votes in Florida. Comedian George Lopez will be campaigning for Obama in Miami and Tampa on Monday, and the McCain campaign on Saturday released a new TV ad featuring Jeb Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of Florida face an important choice,&quot; the former governor says. &quot;Do we elect a president who'll raise your taxes, or fight for working families? A president who'll spread your income, or let you keep what's yours?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With days remaining until the presidential election, you may feel as if you're drowning in political media. Believe me, I feel your pain. - Still, I hope you find the strength to peruse the Five Biggest Election Media Lessons/Trends I've seen during the 22 months we've spent watching Barack Obama and John McCain run for president:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 The new medium politicians must own is online. Forget the Nixon/Kennedy comparisons on the candidates' TV images: The medium where Obama really outflanked McCain is the Internet. Online, Obama raised many millions of dollars, spread videos touting his candidacy, debuted a &quot;fact-checking&quot; Web site to combat negative rumors and used e-mail lists to mobilize volunteers and potential voters. &quot;While McCain was using his resources to own the news cycle, Obama was registering voters,&quot; said media analyst Andrew Tyndall. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 Instant fact-checking emerges. Back in 2004, when the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth raised questions about Democrat John Kerry's war record, news outlets took weeks to vet the incendiary charges. This time around, Web sites such as FactCheck.org and the St. Petersburg Times' PolitiFact.com vetted claims made during the debates within hours. Both the candidates and media know: These days, attack, response and vetting must be immediate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 Political satire achieved what journalism couldn't. Despite constant cable TV coverage, it took The Daily Show's Jon Stewart and Saturday Night Live's Tina Fey to puncture some of the campaigns' biggest absurdities, from the media's love for Obama to Sarah Palin's populist pandering. No wonder CNN and Fox News now have shows blending comedy and news; this is where the cultural action is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4 Liberals developed a media echo chamber to mirror conservatives. Just as talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, the Washington Times newspaper and Fox News Channel create an echo chamber of right-leaning messages, liberals developed a smaller but similar media structure - including MSNBC, blogs such as the Huffington Post and Daily Kos, and the Air America radio network. 5Political success equals positive coverage. A Project for Excellence in Journalism study discovered McCain got more negative coverage because his campaign wasn't as successful. Stories on McCain grew harsher as Obama's poll numbers improved and McCain's actions during September's financial crisis drew criticism. &quot;The old 'nothing succeeds like success' adage was completely reinforced by our study,&quot; said PEJ associate director Mark Jurkowitz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ti-Vo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Simpsons, 8 tonight, WTVT-Ch. 13: Trust schlubby Homer Simpson to come up with a sidesplitting Halloween episode two days after the holiday ends. Still, the show's annual &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; episode shines, powered by gory, animated takes on Mad Men, a Simpson-ized version of Peanuts' Great Pumpkin story and an Election Day bit on a malfunctioning touch-screen voting machine. For Floridians, it may feel just like home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ti-Vo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law &amp; Order, 10 p.m. Wednesday, WFLA-Ch 8: Stuck with a disintegrating Wednesday night lineup, NBC made its best decision so far - bringing back its mothership crime drama early, re-energized by new blood. Jeremy Sisto and Anthony Anderson make a wry pair as the show's new detectives, and British actor Linus Roache is masterful as the show's sharp, competitive American assistant district attorney. Best of all, the mothership avoids the schmaltzy unreality of its spinoffs, returning with an episode about a murderous street brawl and the havoc unleashed when Sam Waterston's district attorney ruthlessly bends the law to prosecute the fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the list</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides the cable news channels, online political Web sites may have benefitted most from this 22-month election cycle. According to the online usage tracking site comScore.com, top political Web sites HuffingtonPost.com, Politico.com and DrudgeReport.com saw in the past year audience increases of 472 percent, 344 percent and 70 percent, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top political Web sites in September, according to comScore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HuffingtonPost.com, 4.5-million users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politico.com, 2.3-million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the site</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, St. Petersburg entrepreneur Frank Maggio dreamed of creating the first nationwide TV-based trivia game network, allowing viewers to play from home and earn prizes. But technology problems, the crashing economy and a fruitless fight with the Nielsen ratings company forced him to find a new dream: an online network of ad-supported trivia sites.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is with the inability of the local TV stations' sound engineers to correct the volume issue? I like to listen to the local news and weather early in the morning before anyone else is up. But as soon as one of the station goes to a commercial break, the volume increases 20-30 decibels. This is so terrible that my family has asked I no longer listen to the TV ... Shame on the stations. ... Please find some money in your budget to hire a sound engineer and correct the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALLOW THE LEGAL GUNS INSIDE </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year the Jacksonville fair has installed metal detectors at all entrances. It is supposed to deter crime, but it is also a deterrent to law-abiding citizens. Even with a valid concealed-weapons permit, you are not allowed to enter with a firearm. While some may see this as a good thing, I see it as an open invitation for criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RACE DOESN'T DETERMINE VOTE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've heard, if you're white and you vote for John McCain, you're being racist. It's not all about racism. I don't know why everybody has to make everything about racism. I am white and I am voting for McCain because I know who his friends are and I'd like to sleep at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN EDITORIAL HELPED ME DECIDE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've had a hard time deciding who to vote for this presidential election. But after reading Nancy Peek McGowan's article in the Viewpoint section of Wednesday's paper, I finally made up my mind. After reading her very opinionated and misinformed article, it's Barack Obama all the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BIDEN ISN'T READY TO BE NO. 2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If something were to happen to Barack Obama when Obama is in office and this Joe Biden would take over as president, this is scary. This guy is an absolute flake. You can see him rant and rave, screaming on TV ... This guy does not have it to be president, and the possibility exists. This is scary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NO PULSE, NO VOTE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I cannot believe that you are allowed to vote in Florida when you're dead. If you are not alive on Election Day, your vote should not count. My grandfather died a couple of years ago, and I know beyond any shadow of a doubt who he would have voted for. Should I be able to vote in his place? Of course not! If you're not alive, you shouldn't be able to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHEERS TO LICENSE BUREAU</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A real treat on Halloween. I have nothing but praise for the Driver's License Bureau on Beach Boulevard. I only had a simple renewal, but I was expecting the worse - to have it take too long ... This office has truly got its act together: extremely well-organized, efficient and friendly. I was in and out in less than 20 minutes. Great job!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILLIPS ARTICLE NEW T-U LOW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times-Union has sunk to an all-time low. Your ad about an interview with Josh Phillips 10 years later, after the murder of Maddie Clifton, is a horrendous thing to do. Why give him credibility by interviewing him? Who cares what this person has to say? The hurt this will cause the family is unbelievable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LACKING SOUTHERN MANNERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have you been to a Gator game? Talk about rude! I think that Southern people who want to throw us Northern people under the &quot;rude&quot; bus need to step back and watch the &quot;true Southerners&quot; who are &quot;not rude&quot; at your next Gator game - and see how they treat other fans. ... Let's focus on being one state of non-rude Floridians and not focus on where you come from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To rant or rave about something, call (904) 366-6373 and leave a message; send an e-mail to rantsandraves@jacksonville.com; go to Jacksonville.com, keyword: T-You; mail items to Rants &amp; Raves, The Florida Times-Union, P.O.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday was a glorious day. Even though the Buccaneers and the Rays lost, the stock market is playing limbo with my 401(k) (How low can you go?) and I'm stuck in a wheelchair, the weather was too nice to be inside. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So my wife and I decided to take an excursion and shop for towels. We were accompanied by our elder son, 22, who was either bored, desperate or both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some might call this spate of cool, dry air Chamber of Commerce weather, or the reason the rent is so high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the reason, I'm thankful for it. The sun warms my face and the wind kisses my cheek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bored/desperate son is a bargain hunter. So our first stop is Linens 'n Things. They are going out of business and are advertising 10 to 30 percent off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arriving at the store, we are greeted with black on yellow banners screaming: &quot;going out of business&quot; and &quot;all merchandise 10 to 30 percent off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There may have been bargains at that store. But, taking 30 percent off already overpriced merchandise is no bargain. We left without buying anything. But we'll return when the discounts become even steeper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next stop on our excursion was Penney's, which was having a sale, according to the bored/desperate son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penney's, my wife will say to all who will listen, is her &quot;favorite store.&quot; In her wallet is a well-worn Penney's charge card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entering Penney's through the shoe department, we saw no signs of a sale on the outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working our way past the men's department, my wife remarked that her only complaint was the displays of merchandise cluttering the aisles. That illustrates a key difference in our respective personalities. I would have hit or run over the displays. She prefers to complain ad nauseam to anyone not in charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both methods accomplish the same thing: nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mine has the advantage of making me feel better and providing entertainment to shoppers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We ended up buying about $50 worth of towels at my wife's favorite store, and the displays were intact when we left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racists, stay home</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This political campaign season has been about ideas, not race. We can all take pride in that. For some, though, everything is about blacks against whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are you racist? This field test should help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask yourself this question: if Barack Obama were white would I vote for him? Ditto for John McCain. Simply change the race of the other candidate. If you're a racist, then stay home Tuesday.</SPAN></P>

And the best part is that we get to enjoy an extra hour of the weekend because daylight savings time ends at 2 a.m. Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extreme outdoors </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't even try to keep your feet on the ground at the Adrenaline Project, which combines outrageous action sports and hip music. Bikes and boards will be flippin' and flying in stunt demos all day today in Vinoy Park in St. Petersburg. Then it's your turn on the 300-foot zip line, inflatable games, bungee bounce and rock climbing wall. The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus is the music headliner at 8:30 p.m., but you'll also hear Whole Wheat Bread, Part One Tribe and Full Fledged Unit. The fun runs 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. at Fifth Avenue NE and North Shore Drive. $20. Go to adrenalineprojectstp.com for the schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See Jimmy Buffett for free!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's right, Parrotheads, he'll play a free concert Sunday in Tampa to support Barack Obama for president. Which means things could get a little tricky if you're a John McCain Parrothead. Awkward. The rally is open to all Florida residents and students, but you still need tickets, which are limited to two per person until they run out. For locations, go to fl.barackobama.com. The show starts at 3 p.m. at the Ford Amphitheatre, Interstate 4 at U.S. 301 N. No banners or signs permitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida feast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think of the Ruskin Seafood Festival as an early Florida-style Thanksgiving with a bounty of shrimp, grouper, mullet, oysters, clams and much more. There's also a boat show, crafts, live entertainment and a kids area with rides and games -- all along the waterfront at E.G. Simmons Park. No alcohol, but Fido can come on a leash. It's 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. today and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday at 2401 19th Ave. NW. Cost is $5 for adults, $4 seniors and kids under 12 area free. Free shuttle from parking area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Send E.T. home</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The classic story of a lost little alien and the little boy who takes him in will be shown at Al Lopez Park in Tampa as part of Bank of America's Sunset Cinema series. According to imdb.com, director Steven Spielberg shot the 1982 film in chronological order to get a real response from the actors (mainly the children) when E.T. departed at the end. (Try not to sniffle when E.T. points to Elliot's heart and says, &quot;I'll be right here.&quot; Awwwww.) The movie starts at 7 tonight, but come anytime around 5 for good seating. It's free, and the address is 4810 N Himes Ave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stock up on art and crafts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is prime art show season, and it shows in our event listings. These caught our eye:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Art Harvest. As art shows go, this is one of the biggies, since more than 50,000 people attend each year.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Citrus County Festival of the Arts. More than 100 artisans will be set up around the Historic Inverness Courthouse Square today and Sunday for the 37th incarnation of this juried show. If you're driving up from St. Petersburg, map your trip so that it takes you along the scenic route through Floral City, with its majestic oak canopy framing U.S. 41. The festival runs from 9:30 to 4:30 p.m. both days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Art Arbor. Friends of Boyd Hill Nature Park stage this autumn family festival, which has 70 arts and crafts vendors.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Music in the air</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Witchstock. It's billed as a cross between Woodstock and Halloween, but let's keep our clothes on and the air free of recreational substances, 'kay? In fact, bring the whole family -- adults, kids and pets -- in costume for contests and prizes. Songs from Woodstock will be played all day, with music by Flycatcher and The Defendants. You'll find vendors with food and beer, plus psychic readings. It's 3 p.m. to midnight today along Florida Avenue in Palm Harbor. Free.</SPAN></P>

Show runs noon to midnight. $25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Know your bungalows</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soak in the color and architecture as you stroll among 10 restored homes - plus cool vintage travel trailers - at BungalowFest in the historic Kenwood neighborhood of St. Pete.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has faced the Truth-O-Meter 159 times, most often on issues involving taxes, the economy and energy. Many of the claims involved his tax plan, such as the one below about small businesses. We've also examined Obama's claim that his tax plan would reduce taxes on 95 percent of working families, which we rated True. But he has sometimes mistakenly said &quot;95 percent of Americans&quot; or 95 percent &quot;of you,&quot; which earned a Half True.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've checked many Obama claims on energy, including one that people could save all the oil from new drilling by fully inflating their tires and getting tuneups (True). And we examined his contention that oil companies are failing to drill on 68-million acres where they have rights (False).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many attacks against Obama have also been about his tax plan, often suggesting he would raise taxes on the middle class. We found the attacks frequently distorted the truth, because Obama's plan would increase taxes only on families earning more than $250,000 per year. But we found McCain was correct that as a senator, Obama has not challenged his party leadership on any major issues and that McCain was right that Obama sought $932-million in political pork. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've examined more than two dozen attacks against Obama from anonymous chain e-mails. The overwhelming majority of these e-mails have been wrong, often ridiculously so. No, Obama is not a Muslim, he did not take the oath of office on a Koran, he did not refuse to say the Pledge of Allegiance, he did not refuse to thank soldiers in Afghanistan, he does not want to unilaterally disarm our nation and he does not want to replace our national anthem with I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statements by Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most small businesses won't be subject to tax increases</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000&quot; and would not see a tax increase under Barack Obama's plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Oct. 15 in a debate in Hempstead, N.Y.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study of his tax plan by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group, indicates that Obama is right. His plan would roll back the Bush tax cuts on the top two tax brackets. In practice, this means that people with income above $200,000 for singles and $250,000 for couples would see taxes increase. It's not easy to identify small businesses because of the way people file taxes, but two analyses by the Tax Policy Center confirm that about 2 percent would see their taxes increase under Obama's plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama goes too far to make his point on gas tax holiday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A gas tax holiday is a gimmick that &quot;every economist says will just go into the pockets of the oil companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, May 13 in a Q&amp;A in Cape Girardeau, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that economists have found oil companies don't pass the full benefit of gas tax holidays on to consumers. For that and other reasons, the vast majority of economists who have opined on the issue opposed the holiday. But to say every economist believes the break would just go to the oil companies is an exaggeration. Even harsh critics of a gas tax holiday said consumers would see some benefit. Obama takes a fact in his favor - that the nation's economists have come down on his side in the gas tax debate - and stretches it a bit too far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's health care plan expands existing system</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Barack Obama's health care proposal, &quot;if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Oct. 7 in a debate in Nashville, Tenn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans often falsely characterized Obama's health plan as being government-run, which prompted him to assert that it would rely largely on the current system in which employers provide private health insurance for their employees. His plan would essentially take today's system and seek to expand it to the uninsured. Obama has said he would like his plan to be universal, in that everyone has health care coverage, but it only mandates coverage for children. He is correct that under his plan, people who want to keep their current insurance should be able to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has consistently opposed the war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I opposed this war from the beginning. I opposed the war in 2002. I opposed the war in 2003. I opposed it in 2004 and 2005 and 2006.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Sept. 12, 2007, in Clinton, Iowa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama opposed the war as a little-known state senator, and he spoke out notably at a Chicago antiwar rally in 2002. In 2003, when he began campaigning for the U.S. Senate seat for Illinois, he reiterated his opposition in several debates and meetings. So his claim to have long opposed the war is true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, abortion numbers have declined</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although we have had a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years, abortions have not gone down.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Aug. 16 in TV interview with megachurch pastor Rick Warren</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his appearance at Warren's church in Lake Forest, Calif., Obama asserted that abortions have not gone down during the Bush presidency. But in fact, the numbers have gone down. The New York-based Guttmacher Institute reported that in 2005 the country's abortion rate fell to 19.4 abortions per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44, continuing a trend that started after the abortion rate peaked in 1981 at 29.3. The institute says the rate of abortions is at its lowest point since 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">68-million acres aren't going untouched</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil companies &quot;haven't touched&quot; 68-million acres where they already have rights to drill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Aug. 4 in Lansing, Mich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The line sounds good as a Democratic rebuttal to Republican support for more drilling in Alaska and off the U.S. coast. But Obama's statement is misleading, inasmuch as it suggests that oil and gas companies have access to 68-million acres of oil and gas fields that they deliberately are not drilling. That is simply not true. Years of exploration and federal permitting must be completed before leased land yields oil or gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attacks against Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the U.S. Senate, Obama's no maverick</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, Oct. 7 in a debate in Nashville, Tenn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limiting our examination to Obama's four years in the U.S. Senate, it would seem that McCain is on mostly solid ground. Congressional Quarterly each year tallies what it considers the key votes that took place in the previous 12 months. Of the 41 Senate votes tallied by CQ between 2005 and 2007, Obama sided with a majority of his caucus on 36 of them. On three, he did not vote. On one, he voted with 21 colleagues against the nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court, a vote that evenly divided the Democratic caucus. And last, there was a 2005 tort reform vote. CQ did not consider the Office of Public Integrity votes to be among the most important of 2006 or 2007. So McCain is correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An absurd claim about a sex-ed bill that never passed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's one education accomplishment was &quot;legislation to teach 'comprehensive sex education' to kindergartners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, Sept. 9 in a television ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The origins of this claim go back to Obama's days as a state senator in the Illinois General Assembly. But the bill never passed, and Obama was not a sponsor or a co-sponsor. He just voted for it in committee. So calling it one of his accomplishments is incorrect. The McCain&nbsp;ad also distorts the impact of the bill on young students. The bill specifically mentions that instructional material must be age appropriate. It specifically mentions teaching children how to &quot;say no to unwanted sexual advances&quot; and &quot;nonconsensual physical sexual contact.&quot; This is a ridiculous claim, because it wasn't an accomplishment for Obama and it distorts the purpose of the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is a Christian, and he was sworn in on his Bible</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama was sworn into office, &quot;he DID NOT use the Holy Bible, but instead the Kuran (Their equivalency to our Bible, but very different beliefs).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chain e-mail, from Dec. 19, 2007</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the chain e-mails we examined say Obama is a Muslim. One contended that his middle name is Mohammed (Pants on Fire). Another one took a different route, distorting Bible passages to allege that he is the Antichrist. (also Pants on Fire). The claim about the Koran seems to be inspired by the 2007 swearing-in of Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., the first Muslim elected to Congress. Ellison used a Koran that once belonged to Thomas Jefferson. But as for Obama, he is a Christian and took the oath on his own Bible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's tax plan hits $200,000 and up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama plans &quot;a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, Aug. 11 in an Internet ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A snarky Web ad from McCain calls Obama &quot;The One&quot; and shows his supporters saying things like &quot;Hot chicks dig Obama.&quot; The ad says that for supporters of Obama, &quot;The perks are amazing, like a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year.&quot; It's a gross distortion of Obama's proposals to say they would raise taxes on &quot;everyone&quot; who earns that much. The McCain campaign's evidence are Obama's votes on budget resolutions. But budget resolutions are nonbinding, don't have the force of law and don't include precise details on taxes or spending. And Obama's tax plan would only raise taxes on people making more than $200,000 if single or $250,000 if married filing jointly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has Obama over a pork barrel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama has asked for $932-million in earmarks, literally $1-million for every day that he's been in Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, Sept. 16 in a speech in Tampa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his Web site, Obama has listed every earmark he's requested - but not necessarily received - during his time in the Senate. It totals $931.3-million, even though the Illinois senator said earlier this year he would eschew any pork for fiscal 2009. Obama took office Jan. 3, 2005. Since then, there have been about 930 working days, as they are defined by most people, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. Overall, Obama's been in Congress for more than 1,350 days, if you count weekends. So how many points do you take off for McCain not saying &quot;every working day&quot;? Not many. We say Mostly True.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several ratings rank Obama lower</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, Sept. 26 in Oxford, Miss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January, National Journal magazine rated Obama the &quot;Most Liberal Senator in 2007.&quot; But he wasn't the top liberal in his two other years in the U.S. Senate, according to the magazine. He was 10th-most liberal in 2006 and 16th in 2005. And Voteview.com, a site created by political scientists that plots lawmakers on a liberal-conservative scale based on their voting patterns, calculated nine senators were more liberal than Obama. McCain's statement suggests it is a cumulative rating for Obama's tenure in the Senate. But in fact, it is true for only one rating for one year. Measurements for other years and by other groups show Obama is not the No. 1 liberal - in some cases, far from No. 1.</SPAN></P>

A president who'll spread your income, or let you keep what's yours? A president who'll spend us deeper into debt, or control spending and eliminate waste? Tough times take experienced, bi-partisan leadership. Join me and vote for Senator John MccCain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What has Barack O'bama's commitment to reform ever shown you? He only served about 300 days in the Senate before he became a candidate,&quot; Palin said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Democrats' big fund-raising surge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the past two months, Florida Democrats raised nearly three times as much money as the Republican Party of Florida, a reversal of recent history that could pay dividends on Election Day. Over the past year, Florida Democrats have raised $29.4-million, compared to the state GOP's $25.8-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the current period, Aug. 22 through Oct. 30, Democrats raised $20-million in the latest period compared to the Florida GOP's $7.8-million. This imbalance is due largely to massive infusions of money to Florida from the Democratic National Committee and the Obama campaign. The DNC sent about $7.5-million to Florida and the Obama campaign $5.3-million. The largest local Democratic donor during the period appears to be the Florida Education Association, a teacher union, which gave at least $300,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party spent nearly twice as much as it raised in the period with $13.1-million in expenditures, including $830,000 in credit card bills. Democrats spent $23-million in the same period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Truth-O-Meter has rated 153 claims and attacks from John McCain. Many have involved wasteful spending and his reputation for fighting political pork. We found, for example, that he was pretty much on the mark about a government program to study the DNA of bears and that he was right that President Bush and the Republican Party have presided over a 55 percent increase in domestic spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We noted that McCain has been pretty consistent opposing pork projects for his own state, but he can't claim a perfect record. He sought $10-million for an academic center to honor the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and he asked the Environmental Protection Agency to provide $5-million toward a wastewater project in Nogales, Ariz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We rated many of McCain's statements on Iraq, including his claim that Saddam Hussein said he had wanted to obtain weapons of mass destruction (True), and McCain's claim last summer that casualties and deaths were at the lowest point since the war began (Half True). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's attacks on McCain have tried to link him with Bush and portray McCain's economic plan as favoring wealthy families and big corporations. We found that Obama was right to say McCain votes with Bush 90 percent of the time, but that Obama was misleading in saying McCain's plan offers &quot;billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies.&quot; Actually, all companies would benefit from McCain's proposal to cut corporate taxes, not just the Democrats' favorite bogeyman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've also checked several of McCain's more unusual claims, including one that the Broadway musical Mamma Mia! sells out consistently (True) and that the average South Korean is 3 inches taller than the average North Korean (also True).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statements by McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spoke up early, held hearings on global warming</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming ... five years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, June 17 in a TV ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the Congressional Record shows that McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that. On Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Lieberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights. Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, called McCain &quot;a huge leader on this issue in the Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's change in posture, not position, on drilling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've always said it's (offshore drilling) up to the states and I still say that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, June 18 in Springfield, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opponents have accused McCain of flip-flopping on offshore drilling, but we found McCain's record is not so clear. In June 2003, McCain was among 10 Republicans who voted for an anti-drilling amendment proposed by Democratic Florida Sen. Bob Graham, but in August 2006, McCain voted in favor of a bill that authorized drilling in about 8.3-million acres of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. In reviewing his statements over the years, we found McCain has consistently been in favor of letting states ultimately decide whether to drill. The difference now is that he's become a cheerleader for the cause. If it's not a change in position, it's at least a change in posture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fannie, Freddie and John, at odds in 2006</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie ... but Democrats blocked the reforms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, Sept. 30 in an advertisement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain did indeed co-sponsor a bill that would have enhanced oversight of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, private corporations created and sponsored by Congress to lower the cost of mortgage capital. McCain signed on 17 months after it was introduced, after a damning federal report on accounting practices at Fannie Mae was released. The McCain campaign has also noted that in 2003 he was one of five Republican senators to co-sponsor a prior bill to tighten oversight of Fannie and Freddie. Still, if he &quot;fought&quot; for reform, it wasn't exactly guns-a-blazin'. McCain overstates his role in pushing for Fannie and Freddie reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas tax holiday much more costly than McCain suggests</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The price of a gas tax &quot;holiday&quot; would be about the same as &quot;a Bridge to Nowhere (or) another pork barrel project.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, April 24 in interview on Fox News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A gas tax holiday would cost the federal government about $9-billion in lost revenue, according to 2007 figures from the IRS. And McCain is way off with his suggestion that it could be paid for by eliminating the famous &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; or another pork barrel project. When Congress was considering the project, the federal cost was estimated at just over $200-million, so it would actually take 45 Bridges to Nowhere to make up for the shortfall in gas tax. He's also way off with his suggestion that the holiday could be paid for by eliminating a pork barrel project. The average pork project costs $1.3-million, so it would take more than 6,900 of them to pay for the tax holiday. The math is so far off that we've got to set the meter ablaze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hussein did say he hoped to get WMD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the United States invaded Iraq, Saddam Hussein wanted to acquire weapons of mass destruction, and &quot;he said so himself after his capture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, June 4 in St. Petersburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim is based on information from the Iraq Survey Group, which interviewed scores of people, including Hussein's top advisers. After his capture in 2003, the survey group gained access to information gleaned from Hussein during detention. Hussein's interrogator for the group, George Piro of the FBI, told 60 Minutes that Hussein told him he wanted to pursue weapons of mass destruction again. &quot;He wanted to pursue all of WMD,&quot; Piro said. &quot;So he wanted to reconstitute his entire WMD program.&quot; Granted, the Survey Group came from the U.S. intelligence community, which got the weapons question wrong before the invasion. But it's the best record publicly available, and it supports McCain's statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was front and center, uncovering a wasteful mess</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saved the taxpayers $2-billion on a bogus Air Force Boeing tanker deal where people went to jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, Nov. 28, 2007, in St. Petersburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, McCain was front and center in a well-publicized effort that killed an Air Force plan to lease 100 Boeing 767s and use them for refueling tankers. The plan eventually led to one of the more notable Washington scandals in years, resulting in prison terms for a top Boeing official and the Air Force's No. 2 weapons buyer. It is well-documented in media and government reports that McCain was quick to identify the $23.5-billion deal as a bad one for taxpayers. He found it in December 2001 and tucked into a little-noticed amendment to the 2002 defense budget. Other senators and watchdog groups took up the fight against the deal, but only after McCain and his staff revealed the makings of a scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atacks against McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama knows McCain's intentions better than McCain?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. McCain would pay for part of his (health care) plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare - $882-billion worth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Oct. 17 in a speech in Roanoke, Va.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $882-billion figure comes from an analysis of McCain's plan by the Center for American Progress Fund, a left-leaning think tank. Because McCain's campaign says the plan would be &quot;budget neutral&quot; - meaning it would be paid for by savings from Medicare and Medicaid - the Center for American Progress assumes the savings would come from cuts to the big health programs. But McCain has never talked about Medicare cuts to pay for his plan. Instead, his campaign says it would overhaul Medicare reimbursement policies, streamlining treatments, cracking down on fraud and waste, and more use of generic drugs, among other savings. So Obama is making a big leap with this one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama&nbsp;ad distorts McCain's stem cell position</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;has opposed stem cell research.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Sept. 16 in a radio ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one time, McCain did oppose embryonic stem cell research. But then he changed his mind. &quot;I have talked with numerous scientific experts. I believe that under stringent safeguards and under the most rigorous kinds of procedures, that this can help in finding the cure for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other serious diseases,&quot; he said. In June 2004, McCain was among 58 U.S. senators - most of them Democrats - who signed a letter urging President Bush to change his position and allow federal funding for scientific research on embryonic stem cells. And McCain has backed up his words with his votes in favor of it in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High earners get a break under McCain's plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain &quot;is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Oct. 7 in a debate in Nashville, Tenn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To come up with that number, the Obama campaign cites numbers from a Forbes magazine study of the average CEO compensation in 2007 for the 500 largest companies, not the Fortune 500. And yes, it comes to about $705,000. But the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center did a more conservative analysis that said CEOs would receive a tax rate decrease of 2.1 percent, or about $270,000. That's still a big number, but not as big as $700,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking it straight from the records, Obama nailed it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain has voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Aug. 28 in a speech at the Democratic National Convention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number is based on a &quot;presidential support&quot; score from Congressional Quarterly, which rates how often lawmakers back or oppose the president. Since 2001, McCain has, in fact, backed the president's position an average of 90 percent of the time. By congressional standards, that's solidly partisan, but hardly marching in lockstep. McCain supported Bush as infrequently as 77 percent of the time in 2005; and as high as 95 percent of the time in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's tax plan doesn't ignore middle class</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. McCain's tax plan provides &quot;virtually nothing to the middle class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Biden, Oct. 2 in vice presidential debate in St. Louis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent studies of McCain's tax plan show that wealthy Americans would benefit the most, but his plan does have provisions that would help the middle class. Chief among these is an increase to the exemption taxpayers claim for each dependent. It's currently $3,500 and would go up by $500 each year beginning in 2010 until it would reach $7,000 in 2016. After that, it would be indexed for inflation. McCain also would tweak the alternative minimum tax and extend President Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, currently set to expire at the end of 2010, which expanded the child tax credit. So it's wrong to say McCain's plan would provide little relief to middle-class Americans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says McCain &quot;voted to let governments charge rape victims&quot; for forensic exams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Planned Parenthood, Oct. 1 in a TV ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad attributes the charge to McCain's 1994 vote on a crime bill that included the Violence Against Women Act, which included a provision that required states to provide free forensic exams for rape victims. Planned Parenthood's logic: Because McCain opposed that bill, he voted to let governments charge victims for their rape kits. But McCain opposed it not because of the Violence Against Women provisions but because it included wasteful spending and had a provision that would have banned so-called assault weapons. And Planned Parenthood conveniently ignores the fact that McCain voted in favor of the act several other times and actually spoke in favor of it on the Senate floor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The half-page ad in a Spring Hill circular features photos of Barack Obama and Osama bin Laden.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A political advertisement in a Spring Hill circular implying that terrorists are waiting for Sen. Barack Obama to win the presidency before attacking the United States again is generating vitriolic responses from a number of local residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The half-page advertisement appeared this week in the Scene Magazine, which is delivered free to 70,000 Hernando County mailboxes. Paid for by a group called Concerned Citizens for America, the ad features a photo of Obama and another depicting three apparent terrorists with shoulder rockets standing behind Osama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They ask, &quot;Osama, when should we attack again?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bin Laden replies, &quot;Wait for the CHANGE!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underneath is the text &quot;Vote For Someone With Real World Experience&quot; next to the McCain-Palin campaign logo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another advertisement from the group appears on a different page promoting the Republican presidential ticket and attacking Obama, but it is more traditional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pat LaGrassa, an independent voter supporting Obama, called the magazine and the U.S. Postal Service to ask that the magazine never get delivered to her mailbox again. Representatives at both said they couldn't do anything about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She called it &quot;the most disgusting ad I've seen in my life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is going into homes where there are children seeing this,&quot; she said. &quot;It's a bunch of garbage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group responsible for paying to have the ad run is a mystery, which puts the advertisement's legality into question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal records show there is an organization by that name, but it is based in Rockford, Ill., and appears to be a local group that opposes gay rights. Recent finance reports show limited or no activity and nothing to tie it to Florida, according to Federal Election Commission records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal law requires any group that makes an independent expenditure costing $1,000 or more within 20 days of the election to file a disclosure report within 24 hours. It's unclear how much the group spent on this ad or whether similar ones appear in other publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Sobczak, publisher of the magazine, which is a monthly publication based in Spring Hill, would not provide any information about who purchased the advertisement space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magazine features mostly advertising and local community event listings. Sobczak said the ad was the first political advertisement he had published and was likely the last. He vowed never to do it again after getting a number of nasty phone calls from upset residents Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the content gave him pause at first, but he approved the purchase because he said it doesn't differ much in his mind from the negative advertising he sees on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We looked at it carefully,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;We thought that (it was) a little over the top because of the (bin Laden) picture, ... (but) it fits with everything you are seeing on TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertisement elicited a strong reaction in Hernando County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm from New York, and I'm really offended,&quot; said Dawn LaDuca, an Obama supporter concerned that the ad unfairly links the Illinois senator to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My nephew ran out of those towers,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shirley Guderian had similar feelings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find it absolutely revolting,&quot; she said. &quot;Unfortunately - and I talked to some of my neighbors - and they believe this. They believe (Obama) is a Muslim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has repeatedly stated he is a Christian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither the Obama campaign nor the McCain campaign responded to calls for comment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SARASOTA - After starting a two-day campaign swing in the most Democratic region of the state, Barack Obama on Thursday wrapped up his latest tour of Florida in a Republican pumpkin patch. On the day before Halloween, Obama - who visited a Fort Lauderdale barber shop, a Hollywood deli and a Plant City farmers market in other campaign stops this year - stopped by a Sarasota pumpkin patch Thursday before leaving the state for rallies in Virginia and Missouri. Mike Dull, a youth leader at First United Methodist Church in Sarasota, showed Obama around the spread of pumpkins and told the presidential candidate: &quot;We're all praying for the best man to win.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who started his campaign swing Wednesday in Sunrise, replied: &quot;That's a good prayer to make.&quot; After Obama left the downtown pumpkin market, reporters pressed Dull about which candidate he planned to support. &quot;I feel I have to vote for experience,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm going to vote for John McCain.&quot; The moment stunned Obama aides, who hoped the breezy stop would provide flattering video for the evening news. Instead, they watched as Dull repeated a central theme of the McCain campaign in front of a group of television commercials. &quot;I'm glad he stopped by,&quot; Dull said of Obama. &quot;I sold some more pumpkins.&quot; Obama donated $25 to Dull's church group, which sponsored the pumpkin patch, and bought two $6 pumpkins, which Obama said were of &quot;modest size.&quot; Before the pumpkin patch, Obama gave a midday speech to about 13,000 supporters who gathered at Ed Smith Stadium in Sarasota. Sarasota County has voted for the Republican presidential candidate in every election since 1980, but Democrats have picked up state House seats in the area and the number of registered Democrats in the county is growing. Obama told the rally about a woman named Robyn whom he met in Fort Lauderdale. She told Obama she couldn't afford an expensive medical procedure to treat her son's heart condition. Obama said Robyn wrote an e-mail, asking him to &quot;think of us&quot; on the campaign trail. &quot;Florida, that's what hope is,&quot; Obama said. &quot;That thing inside us that insists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that there are better days ahead.&quot; ~ mike_bender@pbpost.com</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a conference call to extol Sen. John McCain's plan to direct the government to spend $300-billion buying and refinancing shaky mortgages to help people stay in their homes, Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla., and a fellow former Housing secretary, Jack Kemp, found themselves on the spot over this hot-button campaign issue:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats dispute the suggestion today by John McCain's deputy campaign manager, Christian Ferry, that Republicans are strongly positioned on combined early/absentee voting in Florida. Said Ferry: &quot;Florida is similar to other states where Democrats normally have an advantage following the early vote period, Republicans have an advantage following absentee ballot voting. If you take all the absentee ballot requests, returns, and early votes that are cast, John McCain and the Republicans have an advantage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats say that when all those requested ballots and cast ballots are combined, Democrats have an advantage of 224,261 votes. As of this morning, by their count there were 306,081 outstanding Democrats absentee ballots, 232,921 outstanding from Republicans and 158,763.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An advertising circular appearing in 70,000 Hernando County mailboxes features a controversial advertisement simulating a conversation between Osama Bin Laden and three apparent terrorists saying to wait for Obama to take office before attacking next. A McCain-Palin logo appears underneath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The half-page ad, which appeared in Spring Hill-based the Scene Magazine, is paid for by Concerned Citizens for America. The group does not appear to be registered as a Florida political committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of Hernando residents are peeved. &quot;I'm from New York and I'm really offended,&quot; said Dawn LaDuca, an Obama supporter. &quot;My nephew ran out of those towers. It really pisses me off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The polling's not up to date, but ace Democratic pollster Dave Beattie offers up another reason for Democrats to be optimistic about Barack Obama in Florida: In polling conducted Oct. 5 - 22, Obama is up or tied in three Florida Congressional districts that George Bush won by at least 8 points in '04 - CDs 16, 24 and 25. And in heavily Jewish CD 19, Obama leads by 24 points.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The butterfly ballot and the famous, what, what was that other thing? The hanging chad deal, that's right,&quot; Joe Alabau said standing on the floor of the Palm Beach County Convention Center, about a mile from the former elections office that many feel gave the election to George Bush in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alabau, 53, and a few hundred others are waiting for Al Gore to appear. Even as Gore is expected to rally the troops for Barack Obama, the stain of 2000 hangs in the room. &quot;I guess he's back here to make sure it doesn't happen again,&quot; Alabau said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the lobby, former state Rep. Susan Bucher handed out fliers touting her run for supervisor of elections here. She is trying to unseat a Democrat who has been embroiled in his own controversies. &quot;Because accuracy counts!,&quot; the flier reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitch Berger, a prominent Democratic fundraiser, said his friend has been a model of rising above adversity. &quot;Certainly this will always be part of Palm Beach's and Florida's history as well as his history,&quot; he said. &quot;He has shown us all how to get up from a defeat and move on and rebuild your life. It's a good example for all of us to show we are all human and we all suffer indignities. Do you get up and overcome that or do you get defeated by that? He clearly has shown what kind of person he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rudy Giuliani will be stumping for John McCain in Tampa Sunday (9:30 at Square One Burgers, 3701 Henderson Blvd.), but after living Florida through January, he doesn't have the juice he once did. So what Republican out there can generate huge crowds? Sarah Palin, definitely. Arnold Schwarzenegger (who is campaigning in OH for McCain). Jeb, maybe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee and state GOP Chairman Jim Greer issued statements labeling a Florida Democratic Party lawsuit &quot;baseless&quot; and 'bogus&quot; and noting that RPOF has no connection to a pro-McCain mailer at the heart of the lawsuit. Democrats allege that the mailer could be used in an effort to challenge Democrats' eligibility at the polls -- a charge Republicans emphatically deny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This mail piece has nothing to do with a voter's registration status -- it is a fundraiser that has been sent to Republicans from the RNC for over a decade,&quot; said RNC deputy press secretary Amber Wilkerson. &quot;If it is mistakenly sent to a Democrat, they are removed from future RNC mailings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats Thursday filed suit in Leon County Circuit Court accusing the RPOF and Republican National Committee of an orchestrated campaign to challenge voters' eligibility at the polls Tuesday, in part by using an RNC-paid mail piece that asked older Democratic voters to &quot;verify&quot; their party affiliation by returning official-looking party affiliation cards to the party's D.C. headquarters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Republicans dismiss Obama's incursions into their traditional strongholds.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's a Democrat like Sen. Barack Obama doing in a county like Sarasota?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can do it, Sarasota. You can do it, Florida. We can decide it right here in five days' time,'' he told 13,000 people Thursday in a county that hasn't backed a Democrat for president since Franklin Roosevelt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarasota has been turning more and more Democratic lately, and Obama drew about four times as many people as Sen. John McCain did in the same community a week earlier. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the rally also underscored what makes Obama's campaign so different from past presidential campaigns: He's working even in the most reliably Republican areas of the state, opening offices and organizing volunteers in such conservative areas as Sun City Center in southern Hillsborough County and Chipley, near Alabama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the mistakes we've made in the past is not reaching into some of these really growing swing communities,'' said Steve Schale, Obama's Florida campaign manager. &quot;It's not necessarily about winning every place like Sarasota, it's about coming in and doing reasonably well. The best way to win somebody's vote is to come to their town and ask for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, the rare Florida Democrat who competes in such areas of Florida, noted that he and Joe Biden on Sunday will campaign together in Tallahassee, Gainesville and Volusia County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Contrast that in 2004,'' Nelson said. &quot;The big difference was that John Kerry spent most of his time in the last few days in South Florida. This time, Obama and Biden are all over the state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans understand that if Obama wins Florida, he wins the election. They are ramping up efforts to hold onto Florida's 27 electoral votes. The McCain campaign launched a new ad featuring Charlie Crist on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's uniquely qualified to lead our nation through a crisis. A reformer, a maverick, he'll fight out of control spending and keep our taxes down,'' says the popular governor, looking into the camera. &quot;John McCain never quits, and he'll always fight for you. Join me November 4th in voting for John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Sarah Palin is scheduled to lead rallies in New Port Richey, Ocala and Polk City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Democrats continue to send their biggest guns into America's biggest battleground state. After a week loaded with Florida campaign appearances by Biden, Obama and Bill Clinton, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton is schedule to campaign in Miami and Orlando on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of that, Al and Tipper Gore are scheduled to spend Friday in the Sunshine State. They will be in Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, ground zero for the Florida election meltdown that helped cost him the presidency eight years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida is the ultimate heartbreak state for Democrats, who four years ago felt confident they would avenge their 537-vote loss in 2000 but then fell short. This year, given their confidence in the Obama campaign and enthusiasm from rank and file Democrats, Florida could deliver even greater heartbreak if Republicans keep up their winning streak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Obama doesn't win, somebody cheated,'' said Margaret Smith, a Fort Lauderdale retiree who said she waited in line three hours to vote earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Democrat should be over-confident, said former Sen. Bob Graham, but organization will make the difference this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are Obama headquarters in towns like Perry and Chipley that have never seen a presidential candidate, much less an organized campaign, in decades,&quot; Graham said. &quot;I've never seen a campaign like this in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buzz Jacobs, McCain's campaign manager for the Southeast, dismissed Democrats' claims that Obama is poised to make inroads in traditionally conservative parts of Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even on Halloween, Floridians can't be tricked into voting for a candidate who fundamentally believes hard working Americans should redistribute their income to pay for big government programs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama in Sarasota dismissed the attacks on his tax plans that would raise taxes on families earning more than $250,000 a year, saying tax relief should be targeted to the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain and Sarah Palin, they call this socialistic. I don't know when they decided that they wanted to make a virtue out of selfishness,&quot; Obama said. &quot;You know, the next thing they're going to do is find evidence of my communistic tendencies because I shared my toys when I was in kindergarten. Because I split my peanut butter and jelly sandwich with my friend in sixth grade.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama; fluent Spanish speaker?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No puede ser.&quot; (It can't be.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, there he is in one of his latest television ads chatting away in seemingly fluent Spanish. The Obama spot is saturating Hispanic TV stations in key battleground states, such as Florida, Colorado and Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While countless politicians have made earnest, if clumsy, efforts at Spanish greetings in stump speeches, this marks the first time a non-Hispanic presidential candidate has delivered an ad entirely in Spanish, says Arturo Villar, publisher of Hispanic Marketing Weekly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is most striking is the quality of Obama's Spanish. He speaks almost flawlessly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Compartimos un sueno: que trabajando duro, tu familia puede triunfar. ... Este es el sueno Americano,&quot; says Obama. &quot;We share a dream: that working hard, your family can succeed. ... That's the American Dream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are crying foul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's deceptive. He's pretending to know Spanish when he doesn't,&quot; said Ana Navarro, co-chair of McCain's National Hispanic Advisory Council. &quot;Barack Obama will say anything in any language that he thinks will help get him elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama does not pretend to speak Spanish. Campaign staffers say Obama picked up some Spanish as a community organizer in Chicago. He recorded the 30-second ad in a two-hour sitting, recording each phrase in separate takes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My wife, Ines Lozano, a Spanish language teacher, said it's unusual that someone is able to pronounce the language so well without much practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He obviously rehearsed the phonetics, even though he may not have that level of conversational Spanish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that does raise &quot;a small ethical issue&quot; it does not rise to the level of some of the falsehoods perpetrated by candidates, said Kelly McBride, a member of the ethics faculty at the Poynter Institute, the non-profit school for journalists that owns the St. Petersburg Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lot of things on the political stage that are meant to evoke an emotional response in the audience, whether it be visual props, the setting, how they dress, and what they say,&quot; she said. &quot;It's really part of the game that's played. Sarah Palin is very, very good reading from a TelePrompTer and seeming much more informed than she really is. Is that deceitful?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more important question is what is Obama's intent - besides trying to win votes? To better communicate what he believes in, or to mislead people into thinking he speaks Spanish? I suspect it's the former, as it's hard to deceive Hispanics in their own language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To find out, I played the ad to the first Hispanic I could find. That's not hard on my street. Peruvian-born Henry de la Torre, 48, was fixing the screen on a neighbor's patio Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had already seen it on TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It surprised me,&quot; he said. &quot;He sounds really good with hardly any gringo accent.&quot; The first time he heard it he was so distracted by Obama's pronunciation, he missed the message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was clear Spanish &quot;is not his language,&quot; de la Torre said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that wasn't the point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's good that he forced himself to try and speak our language,&quot; he said. &quot;It's like a courtesy he's showing us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the way, de la Torre is voting for the first time this year. He doesn't think much of either candidate. But he likes Obama more after hearing him for the first time - en espanol.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By CATHERINE DOLINSKI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cdolinski@tampatrib.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TALLAHASSEE - First it was paper ballots. Then it was automatic rights restoration for felons, including the right to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repeatedly, Gov. Charlie Crist has embraced elections reforms on the Democratic agenda. This week, he did it again. After all nine of Florida's Congressional Democrats urged Crist to expand early-voting hours, that's exactly what he did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both parties officially commended Crist for his decision on Tuesday, which expanded early voting from eight to 12 hours on weekdays to alleviate long lines at the polls. But there was immediate - if mostly off-the-record - grousing among some Republicans, given Sen. Barack Obama's perceived advantage with early voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday, Florida Democrats claimed a lead of 384,676 early-voters over Republicans. Republicans were still compiling their report but did not dispute the Democrats' tally. The state Division of Elections did not have a breakdown by party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as he endorsed Crist's decision, Christian Coalition of Florida Director Dennis Baxley said he worries it will rake in more Obama votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It apparently is, because of the way campaigns are being operated,&quot; Baxley said. &quot;The format we have seen in the Obama campaign has been to rile up emotions and get everybody to the polls to vote before they change their mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politico blogger Ben Smith, who declared Crist's decision to be &quot;a very big deal,&quot; went on to quote an unnamed but &quot;plugged-in Florida Republican&quot; as saying that Crist &quot;just blew Florida for John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this, when media and political observers had already accused Crist of backing away from Sen. John McCain, who snubbed Florida's governor in favor of Alaska's for vice president and has sunk in the Florida polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly the governor wanted that V.P. nomination, and he didn't get it,&quot; said Lance deHaven-Smith, political scientist at Florida State University. &quot;He's got to be disappointed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how much does Crist's early-voting order harm McCain, really? An Allstate-National Journal Florida poll found 57 percent of Florida's early- and absentee voters chose Obama. But in a Los Angeles Times-Bloomberg poll, McCain led 49 to 45 among early voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't really know what the impact is,&quot; David Johnson, former director of the state GOP, said of Crist's early-voting order. Quite possibly, he said, it will boost turnout of Republicans as much as Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is, were those people going to vote on Election Day?&quot; he said. &quot;Will early voting help people vote who already wouldn't be voting?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistically, early voting has not been shown to increase voter turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Crist has recently stepped up his campaigning for McCain, complete with a television ad for McCain that began airing statewide Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That does Crist no favors with the independents and conservative Democrats who were critical to his 2006 election and will be equally important to him in 2010, said deHaven-Smith, who thinks that Crist is &quot;doing what he can for McCain&quot; and credited the governor with making the right decision on early voting &quot;in spite of the political implications.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whichever party ultimately benefits from the extra voting hours, Crist's decision remains consistent with an approach to election reform that resonates with average voters regardless of party, said Darryl Paulson, a conservative political scientist at the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg. &quot;I think it clearly reflects his personal philosophy of being 'the People's Governor.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more interesting issue, Paulson said, is Crist's willingness to test his executive authority. Both supervisors and lawmakers have questioned whether it was appropriate for Crist to call a &quot;state of emergency&quot; to override the state's election law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there wasn't an emergency, the governor exceeded his authority,&quot; said Volusia County Elections Supervisor Ann McFall, a Republican. &quot;I did not see an emergency in Volusia County.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP fundraiser Sam Rashid said election issues like early voting give Crist an easy way to pander to Democrats. But Rashid, a frequent critic of Crist, said he would not blame the governor if McCain loses Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was McCain's race to lose,&quot; Rashid said. &quot;I don't think you can put the blame for Florida at the governor's door.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By BILLY HOUSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bhouse@tampatrib.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SARASOTA - Look into &quot;the rearview mirror&quot; to see where Sen. John McCain would drive the economy, urged Sen. Barack Obama to a ballpark full of supporters in this traditional GOP stronghold Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because when it comes to our economic policies,&quot; the Democratic presidential candidate said, &quot;John McCain has stood with President Bush every step of the way.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In keeping up his campaign's eleventh-hour focus on crucial Florida, Obama also urged the crowd of more than 10,000 gathered at Ed Smith Stadium not to let up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarasota, I got just two words for you: five days!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are now five days away from changing America,&quot; Obama said. &quot;We got to work hard these last five days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poll released Thursday by the Florida Chamber of Commerce showed Obama leading Republican McCain 45 percent to 41 percent among likely Florida voters. The same poll showed McCain leading 42 percent to 39 percent on Aug. 25, and McCain up 45 percent to 42 percent cent on Oct. 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closeness of the race in Florida had both campaigns frantically arranging more campaign stops in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Obama's &quot;rearview mirror&quot; remarks in Sarasota, McCain's campaign quickly responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If voters looked into Barack Obama's rearview, they'd see that he supported every one of Washington's wasteful spending bills and has voted for higher taxes 94 times in just three years,&quot; said Tucker Bounds, a McCain campaign spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His economic proposals are driven by job-killing tax increases and out-of-control spending - Barack Obama would drive this sputtering economy off a cliff,&quot; Bounds said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Factcheck.org, a nonpartisan project of the University of Pennsylvania's Public Policy Center, says it is misleading to claim that Obama has voted for higher taxes 94 times, in part because the McCain team has padded the number by including multiple procedural votes on the same measures. The organization said Obama has voted &quot;consistently to restore higher tax rates on upper-income taxpayers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is doubtful Obama will let up on what has been a main theme of his campaign: that the Bush Administration's policies have steered the country into a worsening economy, and that McCain's economic policies would be no different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got an economic plan that's similar to Bill Clinton's,&quot; Obama emphasized, noting the former president had accompanied him at a campaign event in Orlando on Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with his remarks in Sarasota, Obama's campaign released a new TV ad Thursday entitled &quot;Rearview Mirror,&quot; underscoring the same theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Obama's speech, Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson told the crowd that he thought he smelled &quot;victory in the air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign officials also expressed confidence that the Illinois senator will do well in traditional swing-state Florida. But they stopped short of predicting they'll win the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm too superstitious for that,&quot; said Robert Gibbs, Obama's communications director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Gibbs said appearances in traditional Republican pockets such as Sarasota County and New Port Richey are designed to help excite potential Democratic voters who normally might not come out to vote in presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbs said the aim is to &quot;rearrange the make-up of this electorate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's appearance in Sarasota caused at least one person in the ballpark to think about a young Democratic politician of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw Kennedy back when I was a young kid in Pennsylvania,&quot; recalled Michael Tyrell, 55, a retired firefighter from Pennsylvania who now lives on Anna Maria Island, referring to John F. Kennedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has that same feel,&quot; he said, looking out over the festive atmosphere at the stadium.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUNRISE - Barack Obama on Wednesday returned to the South Florida arena that helped launch his general election campaign in the state seven months ago. But this time, he invited a few million Americans. The end of Obama's rally at the Bank- Atlantic Center was broadcast live across the country as part of a prime-time, 30- minute campaign commercial that aired across three of the four major networks and Univision. It was the first time in 16 years a presidential candidate bought a national, prime-time TV slot to make his closing argument since Ross Perot in 1992. &quot;If you'll stand with me and fight by my side and cast your ballot for me,&quot; Obama said, &quot;then I promise you, we will not just win Florida, we will win this election.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And together we will change this country and change the world.&quot; From Sunrise, Obama headed to an 11 p.m. rally in Kissimmee, where he was joined for the first time on the campaign trail by former President Clinton. Obama's late rallies came after Republican nominee John McCain spent most of the daylight hours Wednesday touring Florida, one of a handful of states where the outcome remains uncertain. Obama was teased about the late rallies earlier Wednesday when he taped a segment for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on Comedy Central. The segment was scheduled to air Wednesday night. &quot;I know Florida-many of my people go there to retire,&quot; Stewart joked. &quot;You might want to hold the rally early. They don't like to miss their shows at night or the Early Bird special at the diner.&quot; Said Obama: &quot;No comment on that Jon. I'm trying to win Florida.&quot; Polls show Obama has the chance to be just the second Democratic presidential candidate in three decades to win Florida. Clinton won Florida in 1996 and Jimmy Carter in 1976. Before the rally, Bob Graham, a former Florida governor and U.S. senator, predicted Obama would win the state by 4 points. &quot;John McCain is not just more of the same,&quot; Graham said, warming up the Sunrise crowd. &quot;He is positively worse than George Bush.&quot; Obama filled the 20,000- seat arena, home to the Florida Panthers of the NHL. In May, during his first general election swing through the state, Obama packed about 16,000 supporters into the arena on a twoday notice. Another difference Wednesday was the additional cameras set up in the arena to help broadcast the live feed, including a 30-foot crane that panned the crowd in a long, fluid motion. Another campaign camera was affixed to the rafters just below the third deck of the arena to display the entire audience. With light bulbs popping around the arena, Obama praised McCain for disagreeing with President Bush on how to define torture for prisoners of war. But he pummeled his rival on taxes and economic issues. &quot;When it comes to the central issue of this election, the plain truth is that John McCain has stood with this president every step of the way,&quot; Obama said. Standing behind a podium that was framed by two campaign signs reading, &quot;Vote November 4,&quot; Obama told the Sunrise crowd that his administration would push for lower taxes on the middle class, better access to health care and sharpen the focus on capturing Osama bin Laden. In Kissimmee, Obama praised Clinton, telling the crowd that, &quot;nobody makes the case for change that works for the middle class quite like President Clinton.&quot; &quot;We all wish that the last eight years looked a lot more like the eight years we had when Bill Clinton was in the White House,&quot; Obama said, according to his prepared remarks. &quot;It's time for the kind of peace and prosperity that we saw in the 1990s.&quot; ~ mike_bender@pbpost.com</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read with dismay your recommendation of Barack Obama in the Sunday paper. I really wish the media would keep their thoughts to themselves and stop trying to influence people one way or the other. This is particularly applicable to the radio and TV media. I've never seen more biased media than in this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the media only reported the news and didn't try to influence it. It's time we returned to that position in this country and just print or publish the true facts and not try to bend people's feeble minds one way or the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us use our own judgment, and don't try to sway the voters one way or the other. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doris Houdesheldt, St. Petersburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who knew?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surprise, surprise, surprise. On Sunday, the St. Petersburg Times finally announced that it recommends Barack Obama for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is there anyone who has read any issue of the St. Petersburg Times since the close of the primaries who didn't already know that the Times supported, endorsed, recommended Barack Obama?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either you think your readers are very stupid for not already knowing that, or you are very stupid for not knowing that we already knew. Have fun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alfred J. D'Amario, Hudson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good call</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for your very thoughtfully written recommendation of Barack Obama for president. I was a longtime subscriber to the Tampa Tribune, and their increasingly biased &quot;reporting&quot; related to this election has been disheartening. The last straw was their endorsement of John McCain earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this endorsement was expected, their article read like a campaign ad, with McCain as the gift the country has been waiting for and Obama as a source of great harm. They referred to the young and poor voters as &quot;disaffected&quot; and warned &quot;mainstream voters&quot; of the consequences of their involvement in this election. As a result, I have canceled my subscription with the Tampa Tribune and have just submitted my subscription to the St. Petersburg Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucie Darkes, Temple Terrace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'None of the above' should be ballot option</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a week before Election Day, many polls showed 10 percent or more of voters still undecided between Barack Obama and John McCain. One reason may well be a reluctance to select one or the other of two major candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, on Election Day, undecided voters not wanting to vote for their own party's nominee will receive a ballot that offers no acceptable option to leaving all presidential boxes blank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A resulting stream of unvoted presidential ballots could bring charges of vote tampering or technical glitches and cast doubt on the legitimacy of announced election figures, as occurred in some Florida districts the last two elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To preclude this, I believe future presidential ballots should have an additional box for &quot;None of the above.&quot; Voters could then cast a presidential ballot accurately indicating that they regard no candidate as acceptable. This would make election results a more accurate reflection of voters' opinion of the candidates presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases the number of &quot;None of the above&quot; votes would almost certainly be an eye-opener for major political parties and could bring future improvement in the quality of those nominated for our nation's and the world's most powerful political post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Corydon, Tampa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Times recommends</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No choice can be best</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have always been puzzled why newspaper editorial boards feel it necessary to recommend a candidate even though they have a bad track record. Back on Oct. 16 you recommended Ken Hagan for Hillsborough County Commission District 2 after you said he &quot;has a sorry record on almost every issue, and he is inaccessible and arrogant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excuse me if I find this thinking highly flawed and stupefying. You recommend Hagen because his challenger is &quot;a mystery man.&quot; I have been gnashing on those comments ever since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why not vote for neither one? A refusal to vote for the clown is a signal that the voters don't approve. To vote in his favor sends the wrong signal. Down the road he can refer back to all his vote-getting prowess in past elections when in fact he was the default choice. It is not un-American to not choose either one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randy Wojahn, Valrico</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cure civic malaise: Vote - Oct. 28, editorial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perplexing pick</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, the Times criticizes Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections Deborah Clark's &quot;stubborn insistence&quot; on not opening more than three early voting sites. It is well known that early voters tend to be Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Clark's vote suppression tactics shouldn't surprise anyone. More perplexing is why the Times is recommending her against her Democratic opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Branch, Madeira Beach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish to congratulate you on your very astute analysis of the two candidates for the presidency. Your analysis and view of the two candidates are very close to those I have held for quite some time watching and listening intently to both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am registered as a Republican and I am also a Korean War veteran injured by a hand grenade two days and two months before all the guns went silent. After nine months in a U.S. Army hospital and three surgeries, my &quot;glorious&quot; Army career ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consequently, I very much understand and empathize with John McCain and wish him well. However, I cannot in good conscience support his candidacy for the highest office of this country. I believe that he has made a great mistake by not choosing a better candidate for his running mate. And I dislike very much his distasteful campaign tactics. His behavior exhibits desperation and is unbecoming a future president of the United States. Sen. Barack Obama is so much more believable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teddy &quot;spreads the wealth&quot; - Oct. 27, commentary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crass ploy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I almost choked on my doughnut when I read this article reprinted from the left-leaning online magazine Slate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teddy would rise out of his grave and say &quot;balderdash&quot; to any comparison between his modest progressive income tax and the kind of soak-the-rich class warfare proposed by Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teddy would also worry that under Obama all taxpayers making up to $40,000 per year would pay no income taxes at all yet still receive a tax rebate. Bully that Obama finally added a work requirement for his largesse lest it be seen for what it is: welfare and a crass attempt to buy votes and in the process help destroy the work ethic of country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under an Obama presidency we will achieve the grim prophecy that our democracy will fail when citizens can vote themselves access to our treasury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Kriegsmann, Spring Hill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right thinking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cognitive linguistics scientist George Lakoff has just published a book titled The Political Mind, about how the unconscious mind participates, uninvited, in 98 percent of our decisionmaking. His references to the distinction termed &quot;the right/left metaphor&quot; caused me to recognize the clever use of &quot;right versus left&quot; by politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears to me that &quot;right&quot; could be, intuitively, correlated with &quot;correct,&quot; and also with a &quot;majority&quot; opinion because most people are right-handed. So, when dealing with contested issues, that &quot;cognitive frame&quot; causes my mind to automatically picture a &quot;right&quot; position favorably, while anything labeled &quot;left&quot; appears as a sinister minority opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's comforting to think that my opinions are always right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A Democratic win in any of three key congressional districts could soften U.S. policy toward Cuba.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Puerto Rican-born chef Julio Alicea, 63, used to be a Republican, votingin solidarity with the cause of Cuban exiles. Not this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are losing the American Dream. Who cares about Cuba?&quot; he said, after casting an early ballot Tuesday for Raul Martinez, the Democratic challenger of Lincoln Diaz-Balart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alicea's rejection of Diaz-Balart, the eight-term incumbent in the 21st District, is a signal that the Republican stranglehold on three key congressional seats is in serious jeopardy. The races in the 18th, 21st and 25th districts are closer than they have been in two decades, and a Democratic win in any one of them would not only change the complexion of South Florida politics but potentially soften U.S. policy toward Cuba. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are witnessing a revolution in South Florida politics,&quot; said Fernand Amandi, vice president of Bendixen &amp; Associates, a leading Hispanic polling firm in Miami that works with Democratic candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several factors are at work this year. The Democratic Party has a strong presidential contender in Barack Obama. The local candidates are much better known and better funded than previous challengers. And the souring economy has eclipsed Fidel Castro, long the defining issue of any South Florida election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cuba is not the driving force in this election, it's the economy,&quot; said Dario Moreno, a pollster with the Metropolitan Center at Florida International University. &quot;When people are worried about getting foreclosed on, losing their jobs and their health care, Cuba takes a back seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Lincoln Diaz-Balart and his younger brother, Mario, who has represented the 25th District since 2002, won their districts by comfortable double digit margins of 16-18 percent in 2006. Defeat for either of them could send a signal to Washington that support for the 46-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba is wavering, analysts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martinez, 59, the former Hialeah mayor, has tightened his race against Diaz-Balart, 54, so much that the Rothenberg Report, a nonpartisan newsletter, calls it a &quot;Pure Toss Up.&quot; The latest polling gives Diaz-Balart a 1-point lead, according to RealClearPolitics. The spread had been 11 points when the campaign began in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mario Diaz-Balart, 47, also has his hands full with another high-profile Cuban-American challenger, Joe Garcia, 45, former director of the influential Cuban-American National Foundation. Diaz-Balart's lead is 3 points, also a toss-up, according to RealClearPolitics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third Cuban-American incumbent, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, 56, is having an easier time defending her seat in the 18th District, which includes Miami Beach, against a relatively unknown businesswoman, Annette Taddeo, 41.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martinez and Garcia have run well-funded campaigns with advertising on local radio and television, a first for Democrats in South Florida. The ads have countered attacks from Republican-leaning Spanish-language radio in Miami that have branded them as &quot;traitors&quot; to the Cuban exile cause. One TV ad titled &quot;Wheel of Corruption&quot; portrays Martinez as mired in repeatedscandals, including a 1991 public corruption case for which he was convicted in federal court. The verdict was later overturned and subsequent retrials ended in hung juries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats have sent $1.1-million and a steady stream of high-profile political names to South Florida, including Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has visited eight times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Congressional Committee has responded with $600,000 in advertising. &quot;We feel good about where things are,&quot; said Carlos Curbelo, who advises the Diaz-Balarts. He cited a Spanish language TV poll two weeks ago that showed Lincoln Diaz-Balart with a 14 percent lead, and his brother ahead by 7 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt that a Cuba-less campaign hurts the Diaz-Balarts, who have built their careers on tightening the screws on Cuba's communist regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent University of Miami survey found that Cuban-American voters remain very conservative on U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba but are more liberal on social issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While polls show older Cuban exiles still strongly favor Republicans, younger second generation Cuban-Americans &quot;tend to be more swayed by economic and bread-and-butter issues,&quot; said Amandi. Polls show a majority of Cuban-Americans under 45 voting Democrat. Pollsters say Cuba barely makes the top 10 issues of most concern to Cuban-American voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absence of Cuba from the campaign was no big surprise, according to Curbelo. &quot;The voters know where everybody stands on Cuba. It's not something we need to spend our resources on,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, all the candidates support the main elements of the embargo. But Martinez and Garcia oppose current restrictions on travel to the island by Cuban-Americans with relatives still living there, as well as limits on cash remittances families send.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;His half-hour ad doesn't mention GOP rivals.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some media critics already have compared Barack Obama to John F. Kennedy when it comes to the way he handles himself on television compared to some of the less TV-friendly visuals of his rival, John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So on Wednesday, when Obama made history by placing a 30-minute infomercial on three broadcast networks and four cable channels, the biggest question was a simple one:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What would this telegenic candidate actually do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turns out, viewers got a film that didn't evoke Kennedy so much as Bill Clinton; specifically, the 1992 Democratic convention film The Man From Hope, which set then-candidate Clinton's down-to-earth biography to a series of emotional images crafted by a group of old Hollywood hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of focusing just on Obama, Wednesday's slickly produced film spliced stories of middle-class voters struggling with tough economic times alongside stretches of the candidate speaking on Iraq, energy and taxes, buoyed by clips of prominent supporters touting his case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In dozens of tiny ways, this film was built for outreach to undecided voters, from the use of average folks from contested states such as Ohio and New Mexico, to the film's big finish - a live plea from the candidate himself from a campaign stop before an audience of thousands right here in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most notably, none of the average folks featured in the film actually endorsed Obama. Instead, they reminded viewers of the tough economic issues that are working best for the Democrat right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other notable turn here: No mention of his Republican rivals, John McCain and Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Obama stuck to the themes that seem to resonate with the undecideds: tax cuts for the middle class, an end to the war in Iraq, initiatives for reducing dependence on foreign oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was during these moments that the film may have fallen flattest, presenting clips of Obama statements that we have seen before in other ads. In particular, the story of his mother telling him to stop complaining about getting up early to do homework, has played dozens of times before in campaign advertisements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Filled with folksy images - a young Obama swinging a bat, a decidedly older Obama conducting a town hall meeting - the film subtly countered McCain's recent attempts to paint him as an unknown, untested friend to radicals. Airing on CBS, NBC, Fox, MSNBC, Univision, TV One and Black Entertainment Television, the infomercial gave Obama access to a wide swath of the TV audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Combined with an appearance on The Daily Show at 11 p.m. Wednesday and cable chatter over the infomercial throughout the day before it aired, the film gave Obama a ubiquitous hold on TV outlets six days before the Nov. 4 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party of Florida had a sharp retort ready: &quot;Florida voters see through this rhetoric no matter how polished it is,&quot; read a statement released by the party shortly after the broadcast ended. &quot;Florida voters will embrace John McCain's plan to get our economy back on track, grow jobs, and reform Washington, and they will do so because they trust John McCain's leadership, not because they were sold a candidate on an infomercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An army of attorneys descends on Florida</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the days leading up to Tuesday's election, thousands of lawyers are working the polls in Florida on behalf of the presidential candidates. They insist they are interested in helping voters, not in filing lawsuits, but neither side trusts the other. The filing of a lawsuit Thursday by Democrats against Republicans, amid threats of a large-scale GOP vote challenging effort, could intensify the tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This mass mobilization of lawyers (5,000 for the Democrats, an unknown number for Republicans) owes its origins to the 2000 recount. The 36-day ordeal left Democrats feeling overwhelmed by the Republicans' legal operation. &quot;That's certainly one of my motivations,&quot; said David Sullivan, a Massachusetts lawyer heading the voter protection effort for Barack Obama's campaign in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's appropriate for Democrats to have 500 lawyers in Broward and 5,000 statewide based upon their experience in 2000,&quot; says Ed Pozzuoli, the Fort Lauderdale who is the South Florida leader of Lawyers for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those Democratic lawyers is Steven Weiss (left) of Oakland, Calif., who took a week and a half off from his practice to volunteer as a &quot;Florida Voting Rights Advocate&quot; in Fort Lauderdale. &quot;I'm mainly just making sure people are able to vote,&quot; he said. &quot;If they are walking away without a sticker on I try to find out why.&quot; So far, he said the only worrisome sign he has seen is the length of the line itself. In photo at left, Weiss is speaking with voter Oliver Shields, 29, of Fort Lauderdale, on Thursday. Shields quickly left the early voting site at a library branch because the line was so long, and asked Weiss for information on other early voting locations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Georgia has long early voting lines, too. But our neighbor to the north won't extend the hours of early voting, the way Gov. Charlie Crist did this week, declaring an emergency under an obscure provision contained in the Constitution called the &quot;Florida Elections Emergency Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, criticized by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's editorial page for long lines, says she can't extend early voting because any changes must be pre-cleared by the U.S. Justice Department under the Voting Rights Act (five Florida counties, including Hillsborough, are subject to the same pre-clearance provision).

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama just made a photo op stop at the First United Methodist pumpkin patch in Sarasota. Youth leader Mike Dull offered him a pumpkin that looked more like the head of an orange leper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to take somebody with a big heart to buy that one,&quot; Dull said, who assured the candidate he is &quot;praying for the best person to win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think you're going to have to wait for Charlie Brown to buy that one,'' said Obama, who bought a couple of normal $6 pumpkins and tossed in a $25 donation for the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So who's Dull praying will win? &quot;Personally I feel like I have to vote for experience. I'm going to vote for John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP e-mail raises charges of racism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An e-mail sent by Hillsborough County Republican Party chairman David Storck has critics within the party charging racism. At least one member of the local party has called for Storck's resignation. The e-mail, written by volunteer Ron Whitley and forwarded by Storck to about 400 party members, says that &quot;I see carloads of black Obama supporters coming from the inner city to cast their votes for Obama. This is their chance to get a black president and they seem to care little that he is at minimum, socialist, and probably Marxist in his core beliefs. After all, he is black -- no experience or accomplishments -- but he is black.&quot; Near the end of the e-mail, Whitley writes: &quot;There is only one way to stop Obama: Vote!!!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Storck prefaced the forwarded e-mail by saying: &quot;If you think it can help us win this election please pass it on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curtis Stokes, a member of the Hillsborough County GOP and president of the Hillsborough chapter of the NAACP, said Storck should not have forwarded the e-mail. &quot;He's putting fear in the minds of whomever he sent that e-mail to that Barack Obama is a black guy, and do you want to vote for a black guy, as if there's something wrong with being black. That's not the way you urge people to get out and vote,&quot; Stokes said. &quot;David Storck's not a good representative of the Republican Party if that's what' he's sending out. He needs to resign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Storck initially defended the e-mail, saying it was simply a way to tell Republicans that &quot;we need to get off our butts and vote, too.&quot; Later, Storck said he did not endorse the statement. &quot;It's one of hundreds of e-mails I sent out,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read full text of e-mail:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This e-mail was sent to me from one of our Volunteers in the Temple Terrace office. If you think it can help us win this election please pass it on. This election is now in our hands everyone can make a difference.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's a presidential election in Florida without lawsuits?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both presidential campaigns say they will not engage in widespread challenges of voters' eligibility, but a newly-filed lawsuit by a Democrat against the Republicans raises those fears. Charles Green, a Democrat in Duval County, sued the Republican Party of Florida and the Republican National Committee Tuesday. Green said he got an RNC-paid John McCain mailer that asked him to fill out a so-called Party Affiliation Voter Registration Card (earlier St. Petersburg Times story on the mailing here: http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/state/article814237.ece).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Defendants RNC [and] RPOF are acting in concert and with express and implicit agreement to engage in impermissible 'election integrity' schemes,&quot; the suit alleges. The RNC has previously said the mailing was not part of a challenge or &quot;caging&quot; operation and is merely a fund-raising pitch, nothing more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UPDATE: The Florida Democratic Party joined Green and a Glades County voter, Freddie McPherson, in the lawsuit, asking Circuit Judge Kevin Davey to order that challenged voters need not be handed provisional ballots every time a challenge is filed. The Democrats' suit cites the McCain mailer, select Florida news accounts (The Miami Herald and DeLand-Deltona Beacon, among others), as well as the challenge of an estimated 300 Glades County voters by Republican sheriff candidate. The challenge was dismissed as invalid by the county election supervisor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither the state GOP not the RNC responded to requests for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">View more photos, share yours(http://pics.tampabay.com/?category=682)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 13,000 people turned out to see Barack Obama at Ed Smith stadium. The Democratic nominee noted how the GDP has fallen for the first time this year. Obama: &quot;Now, this didn't happen by accident. Our falling GDP is a direct result of eight years of the trickle down, Wall Street first/Main Street last policies that have driven our economy into a ditch. And the central question in this election is this: what will our next President do differently? Well, Florida, if you want to know where Senator McCain will drive this economy, just look in the rearview mirror. Because when it comes to our economic policies, John McCain has been right next to George Bush. He's been sitting there ready to take over every step of the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, after twenty-one months and three debates, Senator McCain still has not been able to tell the American people a single major thing he would differently from George Bush when it comes to the economy....So you've got to ask yourself, after nine straight months of job losses and the largest drop in home values on record, with wages lower than they've been in a decade, why would we keep on driving down this dead end street?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain-Palin spokesman Tucker Bounds: &quot;If voters looked into Barack Obama's rearview, they'd see that he supported every one of Washington's wasteful spending bills and has voted for higher taxes 94 times in just three years. His economic proposals are driven by job killing tax increases and out-of-control spending -- Barack Obama would drive this sputtering economy off a cliff. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama on the McCain-Palin attacks that his tax policies that would raise taxes on families making more than $250,000 a year. &quot;The last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class. Don't be confused by these ads. Ninety eight percent of small businesses make less than a quarter million dollars. And 99.9 percent of plumbers make less than a quarter million dollars a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All boats rise. That's what happened in the 1990s, That's what we need to restore, and that's what I'm going to do as President of the United States of America. John McCain and Sarah Palin, they called it Socialistic. Now I don't know when they decided they wanted to make a virtue out of selfishness. The next thing you know they're going to find evidence of my communistic tendencies because I shared my toys when I was in kindergarten. Because I split my peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a friend in sixth grade.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI - Puerto Rican-born chef Julio Alicea, 63, used to be a Republican, voting in solidarity with the cause of Cuban exiles. Not this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are losing the American Dream. Who cares about Cuba?&quot; he said, after casting an early ballot Tuesday for Raul Martinez, the Democratic challenger of Lincoln Diaz-Balart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alicea's rejection of Diaz-Balart, the eight-term incumbent in the 21st District, is a signal that the Republican stranglehold on three key congressional seats is in serious jeopardy. The races in the 18th, 21st and 25th districts are closer than they have been in two decades, and a Democratic win in any one of them would not only change the complexion of South Florida politics but potentially soften U.S. policy toward Cuba.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Charlie Crist abruptly extended early voting hours in Florida on Tuesday, finding a legal loophole that could benefit Democrats in the election's last critical days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effective immediately upon the issuing of an executive order on Tuesday afternoon, the state's 247 early voting sites will be open from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. through Friday and will be open 12 hours over the weekend at the discretion of each county's elections supervisor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a 2005 law, early voting was limited to eight hours on each weekday and a total of eight hours on the weekend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist, a Republican, cited historic voting levels and wait times as long as five hours in some parts of the state as the motivation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's top elections official, Secretary of State Kurt Browning, had said last week that there were no legal &quot;means to extend early voting hours or days under the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 11 a.m. on Tuesday, Crist agreed and praised the state's voting laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida has been terribly embracing of making sure that every voter who is qualified has every opportunity to vote and we should be very pleased by that,&quot; Crist said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But shortly after 2 p.m., Crist called a news conference at which he released the executive order extending voting hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a responsibility to the voters of our state to ensure that the maximum number of citizens can participate in the electoral process, and that every person can exercise the right to vote,&quot; Crist explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist said he had legislative support for his plan, but he acknowledged speaking to only one lawmaker, Democrat Dan Gelber of Miami Beach. Last week, Gelber said the long lines and limits on early voting hours were tantamount to disenfranchising Democratic voters who tend to vote early. One of Gelber's top aides for most of his two-year tenure as the top House Democrat was Steve Schale, who is now Barack Obama's campaign manager in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist invoked a legal clause allowing him to extend voting hours in case of &quot;an emergency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ron Labasky, general counsel for the Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections, said &quot;an emergency&quot; has been assumed to mean a &quot;natural disaster&quot; or &quot;calamity&quot; that disrupted voting. But he did not dispute the governor's legal ability to override the law and extend early voting hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labasky said the biggest problems will be further stretching the work hours for volunteer employees and the additional expense for keeping early voting sites open longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data released Tuesday shows that nearly 1.2 million Floridians have voted early and of those, nearly 54 percent were registered as Democrats compared with 30 percent who were registered Republican voters. Crist said that did not factor into his executive order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a political decision; this is a people decision,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gelber, the Obama campaign and the Florida Democratic Party quickly sent out news releases praising Crist's actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately, some Republicans were angered by Crist's move as they scrap for John McCain in a tight race in this must-win state. Crist is traveling with McCain today and taping a TV commercial for him that will air in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But publicly, the McCain campaign backed Crist's move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that Gov. Crist's move is beneficial to the millions of Floridians that want to have their voice heard on Election Day,&quot; said McCain's Florida spokesman Mario Diaz. &quot;This is a historic election with circumstances unique to Florida that is expected to generate a record voter turnout. It is pivotal to ensure that every qualified vote is cast without the prospect of controversy hindering the end result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist's claim of &quot;an emergency&quot; raises questions of his ability to unilaterally supersede the law. House Speaker Marco Rubio, R-West Miami, successfully won a lawsuit against Crist earlier this year that voided the governor's attempt to bypass the Legislature and sign a deal with the Seminole Indians that expanded gambling at the tribe's casinos. Rubio said Tuesday that Crist may have exceeded his constitutional powers, but &quot;time constraints&quot; and political calculations made it impossible for the Legislature to defend the point. Asked if there was a question that Crist may have violated the separation of powers by expanding a law, Rubio said, &quot;I think there is one, but we're not in a position right now to assert it. I think the cost of doing that would outweigh the benefits and the public would see the Legislature as an entity that is trying to prevent people from voting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubio said he has also been dissuaded from voting because of long lines in his neighborhood. He said Crist was correct in protecting the public's faith in the voting process and he denied that longer voting hours would benefit either party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Ron Reagan, R-Bradenton, was the sponsor of the 2005 bill that set up early voting hours. He said that Crist acted correctly. But he voiced some exasperation at accusations that long lines at early voting sites were an indication that Floridians were being denied the chance to vote. Beyond the 15 days of early voting, Floridians can also vote by absentee ballots in addition to more than 7,000 voting sites on Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no reason at all to stand in line to vote,&quot; Reagan said. &quot;We've made voting so easy. In the old days there was one day, 12 hours, that's it. Now we've given you two weeks and a no-excuse absentee ballot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain must beat Obama here to have a chance, as both campaigns go full throttle.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one should be surprised that John McCain and Barack Obama are campaigning in Florida today. Or that Joe Biden is finishing up a three-day Sunshine state bus tour, while Sarah Palin may be in Pasco County on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As much as Obama has expanded the electoral battleground into formerly solid Republican states, Tim Russert's maxim still holds: Florida, Florida, Florida. Because if McCain loses those 27 electoral votes, Obama is the next president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Republicans are working overtime to prevent that, but they're in a strange new world. For the first time in decades, Republicans are up against a far bigger and better funded Democratic campaign in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to be very, very close. We're doing everything we possibly can do to carry the state,'' said state Republican chairman Jim Greer, who remains optimistic McCain will win. &quot;It's unfortunate but the Obama campaign has financial resources that the world has never seen before. Not having the resources to be on TV as much as (McCain) needs to be is a great disadvantage.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Charlie Crist was set to film a TV ad for McCain on Tuesday night, but Obama has been dominating the airwaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic nominee ran nearly 18,909 ads in Florida from Oct. 6 to Oct. 26, while the Nielsen Co. says McCain ran 5,702. From Sunday to Monday, McCain boosted his Florida TV traffic more than 300 percent, but still aired fewer than half as many spots as Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of that, Obama has nearly 500 paid organizers in Florida - about 10 times as many as McCain - and counts more than 230,000 volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rolling average of the latest Florida polls compiled by RealClearPolitics.com shows Obama leading by 3.3 percentage points, and some Democratic strategists think their voter mobilization is so strong they can win if they head into Election Day lagging McCain by a point or two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the best field organization put together at least since the 1976 Carter campaign,'' said Jon Ausman, a Democratic National Committee member from Tallahassee. &quot;The early voting is going so heavily in our direction it's going to way offset the losses we normally suffer in the absentee ballots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through Monday, nearly 20 percent of the electorate - more than 2.3-million people - had voted with mail-in absentee ballots or at early voting locations. No one knows how those Floridians voted, but so far 115,418 more Democrats have voted than Republicans. More than 350,000 independent and minor-party voters also have cast ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, by Election Day Democrats could have significantly more votes in the bank than Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican consultant Brett Doster, a veteran of both Bush-Cheney campaigns in Florida, said Republicans went into Election Day 2000 with about 100,000 more Republican votes cast than Democratic votes and that advantage rose to 150,000 in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Doster said that last-minute absentee votes will likely narrow the Democratic edge in early votes and that McCain is positioned to win the state thanks to the Florida GOP's long-tested voter turnout machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could go either way right now, but I still think McCain edges Obama,'' Doster said, noting that the Obama campaign's Florida efforts are paying off even if they lose the Sunshine State. &quot;They're forcing McCain to burn resources here that they could be spending elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has raised $14.5-million from Florida, and McCain $13.8-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have been honing their vaunted get-out-the-vote operation for years, and it typically provides a two- or three-percent advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's no longer a sure thing given the scope of the Obama operation in this state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Something is going on here. I'm seeing the same excitement that we had in 2000,'' state Sen. Tony Hill, D-Jacksonville, said Tuesday, while riding a bus through Florida with the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Republican leaders remain confident. McCain's &quot;Joe the plumber&quot; attacks on Obama's plan to raise taxes on people earning more than $250,000 a year is resonating, they say, and the grass roots Republican activists are energized and active.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel very, very good. In 2004, I was going to phone banks, and I would walk out and say ... we're going to lose this,'' said Hillsborough County Commissioner Mark Sharpe, county co-chairman of the McCain campaign, recounting the unenthusiastic Republicans he would often hear. &quot;It's 180 degrees difference from 2004. The media is missing this Palin story, and seem to think Palin is a drag. But she has got our base fired up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buzz Jacobs, McCain's southeastern manager, said the Florida campaign has already spoken in person or by phone to 25 percent more voter contacts than Bush-Cheney in 2004. He noted that Florida Republicans have a history of outperforming the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days before the 2004 election, a Fox News poll showed Sen. John Kerry leading President Bush by 5 points, and a CNN/Gallup poll showed Kerry up one point. Bush ended up carrying Florida by 5 points.</SPAN></P>

You've got a few old, gray-haired white guys like me. This is America's future. This is a future state. Barack Obama represents America's future and you've got to be there for him next Tuesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a close decision. If you're making the decision based on who can best get us out of the ditch, who's got the best philosophies, the best decisions, the best ability and the best judgment, I think it's clear. The next president of the United States should be - and with your help will be - Sen. Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Not this time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deafening crowd of 20,000 in Sunrise. Obama: &quot;Look - we've tried it John McCain's way. We've tried it George Bush's way. Deep down, Senator McCain knows that, which is why his campaign said that &quot;if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.&quot; ... Because that's how you play the game in Washington. If you can't beat your opponent's ideas, you distort those ideas and maybe make some up. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run away from. You make a big election about small things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida, we are here to say &quot;Not this time. Not this year. Not when there is so much is at stake. We are going to win this election Senator McCain might be worried about losing an election, but I'm worried about you losing your homes, and your jobs, and your life savings. I can take one more week of John McCain's attacks, but this country can't take four more years of Bush-McCain. It's time for something new.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you're watching this gauzy, feel-good commercial, just remember that it was paid for with broken promises,&quot; a pre-emptive McCain said. &quot;Sen. Obama signed a piece of paper committing to public financing of his campaign. Twice he looked the American people in the eye and said he would sit down with me before he abandoned public financing. He didn't mean a word of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will this be the last time McCain campaigns in Florida? One of his top advisers, Mark Salter, said no decisions had been made, noting how fast things change on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;&quot;When Joe the Plumber starts opining on behalf of John McCain on Israel policy we went up another three or four points in south Florida. I hope he keeps doing it,&quot; said Wexler, the co-chairman of Obama's Florida campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His take on the state of the race in Fla: &quot;We are hitting our peak in Florida just at the right time. It's a close election, it's never a runaway. But we're going to win because we are doing phenomenally well on the I-4 corridor and where we are gelling and peaking at just the right time in south Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Election officials wish 'we had been consulted'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Gov. Charlie Crist's mailbag: A rather chilly letter from the Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections, in which the group &quot;acknowledges&quot; Crist's executive order of Tuesday that expanded hours of early voting. &quot;The Supervisors of Elections who now must manage this situation would have been better prepared if we had been consulted concerning the statewide need for this extension, the manner in which it would be employed and the implementation time frame.&quot; Read their letter here. (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/fsase.crist.10-29-08.pdf)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supervisors got a one-hour notice on Tuesday after Crist decided to expand hours of early voting following conversations with his general counsel and Rep. Dan Gelber, D-Miami Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Secretary of State Kurt Browning said he had heard from some supervisors who asked, &quot;Who's paying for this?&quot; (Answer: counties). Browning, for his part, was solidly on record as saying that there was no need to expand the hours, making it apparent that Crist's order was in conflict with what Browning was saying publicly. But Browning wrote a letter saying hours needed to be expanded, and it was time-stamped in the governor's office at 2:02 p.m. Tuesday -- about a half hour before Crist announced the executive order publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look,&quot; Browning said. &quot;I understand that as governor, he needs to make decisions that he believes are in the best interests of the people of Florida. I understand that I work for Gov. Crist. My relationship with the governor is not stressed or strained at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA -- The country's financial crisis will pass and when it does, threats to America's security will remain, John McCain told a crowd of about 100 invited guests in Tampa today. McCain made his remarks after hosting a national security roundtable with senators and military experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said Obama is not prepared to defend the country. &quot;The question is whether this is a man who has what it takes to protect to America from Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda and other grave threats.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA -- Presidential candidate John McCain arrived in Tampa about 12:45 p.m. today with an entourage that included Gov. Charlie Crist and Sens. Joe Lieberman, Lindsey Graham and Mel Martinez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A motorcade drove them to the University of Tampa where McCain is participating in a national security roundtable. When that event is finished, he'll address about 150 supporters on national security issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Included in the crowd were St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Baker, Republican businessman and fundraiser Al Austin, Hillsborough County Commissioner Brian Blair, former state Rep.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before before Gov. Charlie Crist ordered early voting expanded on Tuesday -- noting in his order that there are &quot;only&quot; 267 early voting sites in Florida -- the Republican Party of Florida put out a very different message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RPOF was answering criticism of Pinellas Supervisor of Elections Deboran Clark for her refusal to open more than three early voting sites in the county. (A Democratic Party official, Jon Ausman, labeled Clark a &quot;suppressor of elections&quot; and called for a grand jury probe of her office).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to Ausman's criticism, the Republican Party issued a statement, a part of which read as follows: &quot;Florida's voters have unprecedented access to convenient ways to cast their vote, including 15 days to cast their vote in person and several weeks during which they may vote absentee in the comfort of their own homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking the microphone to chants of &quot;USA,USA,&quot; Sen. John McCain is addressing a boisterous crowd at a lumber yard near Little Havana and making an urgent appeal for votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to win Florida,&quot; McCain said. &quot;On Nov. 4, we've got to win the state of Florida, my friends.&quot; At another point he said, &quot;You know the pundits have written us off. Just like they have done several times before. They were wrong before and they're wrong now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casting himself as a champion of the common man, McCain railed against the &quot;excess, greed and corruption&quot; of Wall Street, pledged to cut taxes and to &quot;take America in a new direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tentative deal in case of lobbyist's conduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A select state House committee and an attorney have struck a tentative agreement in the case of Michael Dobson, a lobbyist who faced charges of representing a client without first registering as required by law. Under the proposal, Dobson must repay $20,000 to the client, the Panama City Marine Institute, which sought legislative approval in 2008 for a specialty license tag. (That amount is described as &quot;a portion&quot; of the money paid to Dobson's firm.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal requires Dobson to repay the money by March 16, 2009. If he does not, the proposal says the Speaker of the House &quot;may send a letter to the Office of Lobbyist Registration suspending Mr. Dobson&quot; from lobbying. The House released a copy of the proposed agreement signed by Dobson on behalf of his firm, Dobson, Craig and Associates LLC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed consent decree spares Dobson the ordeal of a public hearing on the charges, and it must be ratified by a vote of the House of Representatives -- most likely in an organizational session in mid-November. The six-member Select Committee on Official Standards of Conduct was chaired by Rep. Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain is currently doing interviews on Spanish-language radio in Miami, telling listeners that America deserves to know about Barack Obama's relationship with Bill Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama said it was just a guy in the neighborhood,&quot; McCain said on Radio Mambi, his remarks translated into Spanish. &quot;We know much more than that. So I don't care much about an old, washed-up, unrepentant terrorist and his wife, who was on the FBI Top 10 wanted list, but we should know about their relationship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not that Barack Obama was eight years old when Mr. Ayers was committing acts of terror; it's all about the long relationship on foundations and in his book and launching his political career in Mr. Ayer's living room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also appealed to the Cuban-American vote. &quot;Fidel has made his preference known in this campaign and had some very unkind things to say about me,&quot; McCain said, laughing &quot;My feelings are hurt.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama 47, McCain 45, according to an Oct. 22-26 Quinnipiac University poll moe +/- 2.6^. (full detail here).(http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/102908_swing_pres_bp.doc) John McCain can find a bright spot: A Q poll on Oct. 23 had Obama up 49-44.But among those who say they already have voted in Florida, Obama leads 58 - 34 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. McCain has made up some ground in the last week among white voters, especially in Florida where the race remains close,&quot; says pollster Peter Brown. &quot;To win the election, he has to dominate the white vote and Sen. Obama is keeping it close enough there to maintain his slightly smaller lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AP/GFK 10/22-26 poll (moe +/-4): Obama 45, McCain 43: &quot;Fewer than three in 10 think McCain will win the election. Men prefer McCain by 15 points, women back Obama by about the same amount. People under age 35 back Obama by more than two-to-one, while those age 35 and up lean slightly toward McCain. White men prefer McCain by about two-to-one, while white women are split. Asked about characteristics of minorities, 13 percent of white Democrats in the state said blacks are &quot;violent,&quot; making it one of three states in the poll where that answer exceeded 10 percent. Twelve percent of the state's white Democrats are voting for McCain. Independents back Obama by 10 percentage points. Obama is ahead by 7 points with those who say they've already voted.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Story here. (http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/state/article879527.ece) &quot;It's going to be very, very close. We're doing everything we possibly can do to carry the state,'' said state Republican chairman Jim Greer, who remains optimistic McCain will win. &quot;It's unfortunate but the Obama campaign has financial resources that the world has never seen before. Not having the resources to be on TV as much as (McCain) needs to be is a great disadvantage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through Monday, nearly 20 percent of the electorate - more than 2.3-million people - had voted with mail-in absentee ballots or at early voting locations. No one knows how those Floridians voted, but so far 115,418 more Democrats have voted than Republicans. More than 350,000 independent and minor-party voters also have cast ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican consultant Brett Doster, a veteran of both Bush-Cheney campaigns in Florida, said Republicans went into Election Day 2000 with about 100,000 more Republican votes cast than Democratic votes and that advantage rose to 150,000 in 2004. Still, Doster said that last-minute absentee votes will likely narrow the Democratic edge in early votes and that McCain is positioned to win the state thanks to the Florida GOP's long-tested voter turnout machine.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist's quick shift on early voting hours</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proving once again, that he has no problem changing his mind, here's Gov. Charlie Crist on whether he has the authority or the will to extend early voting hours around 11 a.m. this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe we do (have the authority to extend voting hours). Under the law, it's open for eight hours per day and eight hours for the weekend. And that's what's happening in the counties throughout the state. I think it's been the most open opportunity for people to vote early that we've ever had. In addition to voting early, if they want to vote by mail, they can vote by mail. And they can vote Election Day. Florida has been terribly embracing of making sure that every voter who is qualified has every opportunity to vote and we should be very pleased by that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listen to it here (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/earlyvoting.mp3).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Posted by Jennifer Liberto at 3:12:54 PM on October 28, 2008</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist extends early voting hours</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Charlie Crist on Tuesday afternoon issued an order expanding the hours of early voting up to 12 hours a day through Saturday, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and a total of 12 weekend hours, between 7 a.m. Saturday and 7 p.m. Sunday. (The law allowed for a maximum of eight hours a day and a total of eight on the weekend).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a hastily arranged news conference, Crist said the right to vote is sacred and that &quot;many have fought and died for this right.&quot; He said he consulted a leading Democratic legislator, Rep. Dan Gelber of Miami Beach, before issuing his order, and that Gelber knew of a similar order issued by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2002 that dealt with helping voters deal with new equipment. (Buzz audio here (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/cristpresser2008-10-28.mp3).)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the perception that more early voting helps Democrats, Crist said: &quot;This is not a political decision. This is a people decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, all nine Democrats in the Florida congressional delegation wrote a letter (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/ltr_to_crist_and_browning_on_voting.pdf) urging him to expand early voting and to order all early voting sites to be open on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early balloting in Florida so far favors Democrats, while Republicans hold an advantage in absentee voting. Waits of up to four hours have been reported in precincts in heavily-Democratic Broward County.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla., has agreed to pay $110,500 for violating federal campaign finance laws governing contribution limits and reporting requirements from his 2004 campaign, Federal Elections Commission records show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an FEC agreement struck Oct. 10, Martinez's campaign agreed to the improprieties and the fines and promised to revamp the system it uses to track of donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FEC, meanwhile, said it didn't believe Martinez personally violated the Federal Election Campaign Act, and that it has &quot;made no findings that the violations described in this Conciliation Agreement were knowing and willful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost to Martinez's campaign includes a fine of $99,000, which the FEC was kept relatively low thanks to the campaign's cooperation during the investigation, and $11,500 in donations that exceeded the $2,000 limit for cash contributions, but which could not be properly returned or rolled over to another campaign account.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what Republicans label a &quot;stunt,&quot; Democratic National Committeeman Jon Ausman wants a grand jury probe of Pinellas Supervisor of Elections Deborah Clark for &quot;possible misfeasance&quot; because she offers three early voting sites in a county with nearly 650,000 voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinellas has slightly more registered Democrats than Republicans and is seen as a key county in the presidential race in Florida. Clark is a Republican, and Ausman said the state attorney should convene a grand jury in its role as a traditional watchdog over how government agencies function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ausman says state figures show that Pinellas has the lowest early voting turnout rate in the state so far (2.7 percent) and he says that's no coincidence. &quot;Early voting overwhelmingly favors Democratic voters,&quot; Ausman said. &quot;Pinellas County is the worst county when it comes to allowing its voters to vote early.&quot; Clark aggressively promotes absentee voting over early voting, which Ausman said traditionally is favored by Republican voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jon Ausman's political stunt today, while typical, is as deceptive as his claims are false,&quot; said Erin VanSickle, a Republican Party spokeswoman. Noting Florida's 15-day window for early voting and several weeks during which voters can request an absentee ballot, she asks: &quot;How is this suppressing the vote?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes2Marriage.org leader and Orlando attorney John Stemberger released a letter accusing Amendment 2 folks of clouding the issue and trying to scare seniors with their ads that point out that Amendment 2 could threaten domestic partner benefits. Read the letter on the jump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Open Letter to Opponents of Amendment 2:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Part about &quot;Single Subject&quot; Don't You Understand?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By John Stemberger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Chairman, Yes2Marriage.org</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just &quot;Making Stuff Up&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opponents of Amendment 2 in Florida want to talk about anything and everything except what the Florida Marriage Protection Amendment is all about. They want to talk about hospital visitation, benefits, domestic violence, social security, tough economic times, health care, Michigan, domestic partnerships, more benefits, putting government into your private life, alleged campaign violations and any other number of contrived focus group tested themes. But they absolutely refuse to discuss the driving force behind why 27 states amended their state constitutions by overwhelming majorities-- to protect the definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman. In fact, I can't find a homosexual activist anywhere in this state that will debate the policy question of whether same sex marriage is a good idea for Florida's children and families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trying to Scare Our Most Vulnerable: Seniors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After having been beaten badly in the marketplace of ideas in 27 states, gay activists had to think up a new strategy and a new message. The new message employed in 2006 in the state of Arizona was to not say a word about &quot;gay rights&quot;, &quot;gay marriage&quot; or even &quot;gay equality&quot;. The new pathetic strategy was to only say that the marriage amendment would &quot;somehow&quot; hurt senior citizens. And that it would take away &quot;benefits&quot; from unmarried persons. And they would say this new message over-- and over--and over again. And it worked. Arizona became the first state to ever lose a state marriage amendment by a couple of points. So this explains the reason for our opponent's messaging in Florida, a state where one out of every five persons is a senior citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ignoring the Obvious and the Important</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disingenuous arguments being made by Florida Red and Blue, the ACLU and Equality Florida are really too numerous to address in one article. But all their arguments are tied to the idea that the language of the amendment will &quot;somehow&quot; (no explanation is given) do all these really bad things. But they never care to break out the Webster's to examine the words of the amendment language much less look at the existing legal cases directly interpreting the language. And they completely ignore the fact that the Florida Supreme Court has unanimously approved the language of the amendment! Interestingly enough, even though every single daily newspaper in Florida has taken a position against Amendment 2, not a single editorial has even referenced, much less analyzed, what the highest legal authority in this state has already said about the scope of the amendment. Instead, the newspapers have shamelessly taken our opponents reprehensible talking points and parroted them back to readers and in most cases, word-for-word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Single Subject = One Thing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizen's initiatives have the unique legal requirement of being limited to a &quot;single subject&quot;. If the amendment addresses more than one topic, or if the language is unclear and ambiguous, then it is struck from the ballot by the high court. I appeared before the Florida Supreme Court with Attorney Mat Staver of Liberty Counsel as he argued the &quot;single subject&quot; requirement at an oral argument court hearing. The high court quickly and summarily rejected the ACLU's arguments, that the amendment would affect domestic partnerships and other benefits. Yet these are exactly the same arguments that our opponents are making now in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Little Honesty Please?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, what has the highest legal authority in this state said about Amendment 2 that our opponents refuse to mention and the news media has never printed in a single news story or editorial position? They said this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The voter is being asked to vote on the single subject of whether the concept of marriage... should be limited to the union of one man and one woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; The amendment essentially tracks the current language of the current statutory provision...inserting this statutory scheme into the constitution with language substantially similar to the statutory provision itself.&quot; See Advisory Opinion to the Attorney General Re: The Florida Marriage Protection Amendment, 926 So. 2d 1229 (2006).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Amendment 2 takes the existing law on marriage and places it into the constitution to prevent it from being redefined as it has been in Massachusetts, California and just recently in Connecticut. The bottom line is this-- if the amendment language did take away benefits then we would not be here today because the court would have thrown the amendment out as dealing with more than one subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Substantially Equivalent Boogie Man</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure that existing domestic partnerships are not affected, Amendment 2 also prohibits any union that is the &quot;substantial equivalent&quot; of marriage. The words substantial equivalent mean &quot;almost equal&quot; or &quot;virtually identical&quot; and were found by the Florida Supreme Court to be clear, unambiguous and words &quot;frequently used by the common voter&quot;. These words give the court a bright- line test to weigh the rights of &quot;other legal unions&quot; against those rights found in marriage. Existing domestic partnerships in Florida grant a very small bundle of 6-8 rights. In contrast, marriage grants hundreds of rights at a state level and 1,138 rights at a federal level. Florida's domestic partnerships are quite safe for the simple reason that their 6-8 rights could never be legally construed to be the substantial equal to the huge number of rights conferred in marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So to all the intellectually dishonest opponents of Amendment 2 I say this: If you think that same sex marriage is a great idea, then fair enough--make that argument. But do not commit mass fraud on the people of Florida with deceptive and false ads advertisements about seniors and unmarried persons losing rights and benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opening words of Mat Staver's oral argument before the Florida Supreme Court were these: &quot;While most initiatives create something new, this amendment protects something old. It does not change the existing law but preserves the status quo.&quot; Attorney Staver is exactly right. Amendment 2 does nothing new but only protects something that is timeless, longstanding and precious. For children, for families and for the next generation, please vote &quot;Yes&quot; on Amendment 2.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Red and Blue, the group fighting against the gay marriage ban, filed a lawsuit today in Miami-Dade Circuit Court asking a judge to force the group campaigning for Amendment 2 to disclose all its donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of Florida4Marriage.org, John Stemberger has said as recently as last week that his group's fundraising records have been disclosed as much as they need to be, as allowed by federal law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suit asks for a judge to force Florida Family Action Committee and Florida Family Policy Council to disclose their donors. They also want the judge to stop the groups from &quot;expenditure of illegally obtained and expended funds,&quot; which means, they want to stop pro-Amendment 2 TV ads.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If John McCain's plumber lived in Florida, he'd be a retiree named Stan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Republican presidential candidate repeatedly evoked &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; last week in Florida to rally support for his anti-tax message, it recalled the &quot;Remember Stan&quot; mantra that Gov. Charlie Crist used in 2007 to push for sweeping changes to the state's property insurance laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with the presidential race in Florida entering the final stages, McCain hopes his populist message will translate into the same success as Crist's. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a very similar analogy,&quot; Crist said last week. &quot;It's everyday people that need help, especially during these economic times. We talked about that during the governor's race - they were pocketbook issues then and they're pocketbook issues still.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stan Whitney, a Port Charlotte retiree, lost his property insurance after Hurricane Charley and wrote to Crist about his plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist cast Whitney as the &quot;everyman&quot; in Florida suffering at the hand of &quot;greedy insurance companies,&quot; and the two appeared together at several news conferences, including one to celebrate the legislature's approval of tighter insurance regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has used Joe Wurzelbacher, an Ohio plumber who asked Democratic candidate Barack Obama about trying to buy a small business, to exemplify the working-class Americans who can't afford &quot;tax-and-spend liberals&quot; in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign officials dismissed McCain's &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; tour in Florida, saying Obama's tax plan would provide a tax cut to 95 percent of families. They also point to national polls that indicate voters prefer Obama's tax policies and say they are positioned to become just the second Democratic presidential campaign in three decades to win the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain gambits like Joe the Plumber ... are not going to get the job done,&quot; said Obama's campaign director, David Plouffe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Florida, Obama officials claim they have rebuilt support in southern Palm Beach County and other Jewish strongholds where many voters backed Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary and initially indicated they might vote for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Quinnipiac poll last week showed Obama winning 77 percent of the Jewish vote in Florida, up from 65 percent in June. An internal Democratic poll in U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler's district, which has a high concentration of Jewish voters, showed that 76 percent of Jewish voters planned to vote for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This idea that Jews wouldn't vote for Obama was bunk,&quot; Obama spokesman Bobby Gravitz said. &quot;Once we're in a place where voters are voting on the truth and not rumors, we win the Jewish vote in a commanding way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat John Kerry won about 77 percent of the Jewish vote in 2004, according to the Solomon Project. Bill Clinton won a record 80 percent of the Jewish vote in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both of this year's candidates campaigned in Florida last week and have dispatched their running mates to tour the state this week in what is expected to be a mad dash for the Nov. 4 finish line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts predict that Obama can win the White House by winning Florida, a state believed to be critical for McCain in the Electoral College math.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to be close; I think we may be up late,&quot; McCain said. &quot;I hope not like 2000 - not that close.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some believe McCain's best chance at winning Florida could be the state's popular governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even McCain acknowledged that receiving Crist's endorsement in January was a &quot;key element in winning the primary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope they'll drag me over the finish line again,&quot; McCain said in Ormond Beach, pointing to Crist and U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains to be seen whether McCain can use Joe the Plumber to convince Floridians in the final days of the campaign, but the message has gained traction with Crist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That message resonates,&quot; Crist said. &quot;What happens to people in their daily lives and their families and their pocketbook is really what people care deeply about.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Separated by traffic and ideology, campaigners face off from opposite corners.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America stands at a political crossroads as the Nov. 4 election looms. In Hernando County, the political crossroads, literally, are at the busy intersection of Cortez and Mariner boulevards. - For weeks now at the intersection, the Democratic and Republican parties have set up set up tents, hosted rallies and waved signs at passers-by and shoppers. - In previous election years, politicians have always waved signs, hoping to score a vote or two. But the frequency and fervor of the electioneering this year - several days a week and especially on weekends - is far beyond anything that has been done before, organizers say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the battleground,'' said John Druzbick, the Republican candidate in the District 3 County Commission race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing on the northwest corner of the intersection waving his campaign sign Saturday morning, Druzbick wasn't sure whether the sign-waving would do any good, but he said the exposure has given lots of people the opportunity to stop and talk to him about his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the national politicos, Hernando County's party leaders have been waging the same kind of battle in the parking lot between Carrabba's and Walgreens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Rowden, local head of the Democratic Party, said his folks had staked out their claim to real estate about 4:45 a.m. Saturday. The Republicans were there, too, getting ready to set up their materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jockeying for the best turf has become a key part of each day's campaigning effort. For weeks now, the Democrats have been at the intersection. Then one weekend, the Republicans showed up with their materials and sign wavers. Why not? Druzbick said. It was a good way to get the message out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On another weekend, local home builder and political activist Blaise Ingoglia showed up with his huge revolving-message truck, a billboard on wheels that some of the political activists now refer to as the &quot;Blaise-mobile.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To counter in their own small - very small - way, County Commission District 3 incumbent Diane Rowden parks her campaign-sign-wrapped Smart car nearby. Then she shows off her 80-pound poodle, Kirebo, first wearing a Rowden T-shirt, then an Obama one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conscious effort to out-position the competition has grown over the weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an Oct. 16 e-mail to fellow Republicans, the head of Hernando's Republican Party, Ana Trinque, urged people to turn out the following Saturday in the parking lot at Cortezand Mariner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need a lot of volunteers for manning the tent area by Carrabba's and Walgreens ... this Saturday between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.,&quot; she wrote. &quot;The Democrats hope to hold a huge Obama rally there Saturday. Let's spoil their day.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just like at the national level, the local party faithful are confident of their message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ingoglia, who is airing commercials urging people to vote out the incumbent county commissioners, said his motives are pure. &quot;The bottom line is that we need to start looking out for the greater good,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the nearby Republican booth Saturday, where a &quot;No Osama No Obama'' sign was prominently displayed, party supporters were thrilled to see motorists pulling up and asking for yard signs, T-shirts, bumper stickers and buttons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so interesting to watch,'' said Clara Adkins, wife of District 1 County Commission candidate James Adkins, as a gray-haired couple approached the booth seeking information about the candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in the other camp, Democratic precinct chairwoman Dianne Maughan was excited to have the chance to promote the idea of women supporting Barack Obama for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm 65 years old, and he is the first candidate for president that I've really been passionate about,'' she said. &quot;I believe in him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So did the next visitor to the booth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spring Hill resident Daisy Swackard was positively thrilled to pick up some Obama materials. She danced her way back to her vehicle chanting, &quot;O-ba-ma, O-ba-ma, O-ba-ma.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was music to the ears of at least one camp in the parking lot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain begins with a joke about the Obama campaign's apparent boycott of the station. He was settling in for some free TV exposure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But West put McCain on the ropes, asking about strife with Sarah Palin (&quot;pure unadulterated baloney,&quot; says McCain) and suggesting that while Obama has a &quot;well coordinated&quot; Florida operation, the McCain team &quot;still seems to be trying to get itself organized.&quot; An incredulous McCain laughed, &quot;Really?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all comes down to this: A final push by John McCain and Barack Obama to win Florida and its 27 electoral votes. Here's the latest on their plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain arrives in Miami on Tuesday night. He'll have an event in the morning then heads to Tampa and West Palm Beach. The Tampa event will focus on national security and West Palm will be on the economy. Both events will have limited, or &quot;pool,&quot; press access, suggesting they will be more intimate in scope. Could McCain be trying to avoid crowd comparisons with Obama?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new list of unverified voters under the so-called no match law lists 12,165 names, an increase of one third over the first list of 8,867 released a week-and-a-half ago. Even as election supervisors work to match voters' identities so they can cast real ballots, the list continues to grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new list includes still-unverified names from the original list, and African-Americans and Hispanics continue to comprise slightly more than half of the total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary of State Kurt Browning's office pointed out that the total is 2.7 percent of all new voters who have registered since Sept. 8, when the law was re-implemented after the state prevailed in a federal lawsuit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This mailer spreads the same message that popped up in the last weeks of the Arizona 2004 ballot initiative to ban gay marriage, which failed that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, passing Amendment 2 would not automatically prevent &quot;Wayne&quot; from staying with &quot;Helene&quot; while she waits for breast cancer surgery, as the ad suggests. It would be up to a court to decide whether hospital visitation rights for domestic partners, which some Florida municipalities grant, would be impacted by the passage of a constitutional amendment, which limits marriage and its &quot;substantial equivalent&quot; to a man and woman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama continues to lead John McCain by a slim margin,&quot; said David Paleologos, director of the Political Research Center at Suffolk University in Boston. &quot;But our Florida bellwethers may be telltale signs of the race tightening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both Florida bellwethers of Hillsborough and Monroe counties, Obama and McCain were deadlocked at exactly 42 percent each. Suffolk University conducts bellwether polls in particular regions that historically reflect how the wider population will vote. Statewide, Obama led McCain 46 percent to 45 percent among those very likely to vote but was crushing McCain 60 percent to 40 percent among those who had already voted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Party of Florida Chairman Jim Greer is calling out local elections officials, including Pinellas County supervisor Deb Clark, who are deviating from guidelines under the controversial &quot;no match&quot; voter verification law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a Greer news release: &quot;Despite the clear language of the law, the practices outlined on the Pinellas Supervisor of Elections website call for regular ballots, not provisional ballots, to be issued to voters whose information has not been verified before they arrive at the polling place. According to the Pinellas Supervisor of Elections, &quot;If a citizen with a pending application brought identification to the polls that matches the identification number that he/she has on the application, the application would be considered completed, and the voter would be given a regular ballot.&quot; (full release below)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Charlie Crist predicted the Rays would make the playoffs and they did. He predicted voters would pass the Amendment 1 property tax cut, and they did. He said Monday that John McCain is in good shape in Florida, despite not choosing him as his running mate, and said: &quot;I think Sen. McCain's going to win regardless. I really do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dismissed the suggestion in a weekend New York Times piece that he would be more bullish on McCain's campaign if his pre-taped seven-minute speech was shown to TV viewers at the Republican convention in August. &quot;No, it's probably better that it didn't play. It wasn't that good,&quot; Crist said. &quot;I couldn't be more enthused about Sen. McCain and his opportunity to be our next president.&quot; He said he will campaign alongside McCain if the senator, as expected, returns to Tampa on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist also encouraged state agencies to utilize a little-noticed provision in state law that says state workers &quot;may&quot; be given up to an hour off to vote during working hours. Most state employees are Democrats. &quot;I'm sure they're aware of it, and I would encourage them to do so,&quot; Crist said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what he thinks of the wisdom of the possibility of using foreclosure lists to challenge the legitimacy of any voters, Crist said: &quot;Not much. I don't understand why it would be something we would pursue.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zogby/Reuters Oct. 23-26 Florida poll (http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1612) (moe +/- 4.1%) shows a tied race, with 47.2% for Obama and 46.9% for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain is winning 16% of Democrats compared to Obama's 10% with Republicans. That is enough to offset Obama's 64%-25% lead with Independents. McCain's favorable showing with Democrats is reflected in his 55%-38% lead among those over 65. Whites choose McCain by 17, while Hispanics favor Obama by 16. Maximizing African-American turnout will be the key to a possible Obama win.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. PETERSBURG -- It was only 9:30 a.m., but inside the dingy Central Avenue storefront, volunteers filtered in and out. A half-dozen 20-somethings hunched over laptops and worked their cell phones. A sign taped to the wall said: &quot;How am I increasing my infrastructure? How can I empower my team leaders? How can I multiply my field army?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across Florida, there are about 60 such offices, an estimated 500 paid organizers and tens of thousands of volunteers on the front line. Florida Republicans have been fielding daunting get-out-the-vote programs for years, but this is the most massive organizing operation Florida has seen from a presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So sweeping and so lavishly funded is the volunteer-focused campaign that many Democrats think, win or lose, Obama's efforts will reverberate well beyond this election cycle in Florida.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current economic disaster leaves me bitter. My parents grew up during the Depression, and I was inculcated with one basic financial tenet: Live within your means. Except for houses and cars, if you couldn't pay for it with cash, then you couldn't afford it. I was taught to save for emergencies, to not pay for services that I could do myself, and to value every penny. I cringe to think that I would ever need a government to bail me out because of choices that I made along the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever happened to personal responsibility anyway? If I had gotten in over my head with a house I couldn't afford, I would certainly not expect anyone to rescue me from my poor judgment. I am deeply angered that my tax dollars and retirement savings will be spent to assist folks who believed there were short cuts to the American Dream. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must do something about property taxes. The economy is stagnating. It is a disaster while the present property appraiser is still busy with the problems of 12 years ago and the building of his own assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need a new property appraiser who understands today's problems and how to solve them, not those of 12 years ago, which should have been cleaned up in at the very most, one term - four years, not three terms - 12 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the autumn sun set over the rolling Loudoun County countryside and on Barack Obama's stump speech, giant amplifiers blasted the Brooks &amp; Dunn song Only in America across the tens of thousands of Virginians gathered on grassy hillsides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One kid dreams of fame and fortune. One kid helps pay the rent,&quot; the country music duo's lyrics blared. &quot;One could end up going to prison. One just might be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to an enthusiastic, overwhelmingly white crowd Wednesday in a Southern state that hasn't voted for a Democrat for president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, the Illinois senator who's running to become the first black to hold the nation's highest office echoed the themes of the song.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in America, destiny is not written for us. It is written by us,&quot; declared the 47-year-old candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, Obama flew to his boyhood home of Hawaii to see his ailing 86-yearold grandmother, whom he called &quot;the rock&quot; in a family story that truly could happen &quot;only in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the estimated 35,000 supporters in Ida Lee Park, named for a first cousin of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, outside the historic town of Leesburg, 18-year-old Caitlin Lockhart said she would cast her first vote for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love his plans for change,&quot; said Lockhart, whose life reflects many of the problems the next president will face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was laid off from the bank where she worked in Martinsburg, W.Va., she said. And her fianc&Oslash; is in the Air Force and has done two tours of duty in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lockhart believes Obama is &quot;very sincere&quot; in his promises to help people like her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly two decades ago, another young woman also believed that Obama was sincere in his desire to help others and in his professed feelings for her. But a wary Michelle Robinson decided to test his character - on a basketball court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She had been going out with the guy with an unusual name whom she had met at their law firm of Sidley Austin, and they had done community betterment projects on the South Side of Chicago. Obama also talked trash about his hoops game, so she wanted her big brother, Craig, to see whether he could back it up. Craig Robinson starred for Princeton and has gone on to coach at Brown University and Oregon State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My sister had grown up hearing my father and me talk about how to judge a person's character by what type of sportsman they are, so she asked me to take Barack to play basketball,&quot; Robinson explained at the Democratic National Convention in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're looking for a political analysis based on his playing, here it is: He's confident but not cocky, he'll take the shot if he's open, he's a team player who improves the people around him, and he won't back down from any challenge,&quot; said the coach who is now Obama's brother-in-law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year or so after that pickup game, the skinny 6-foot-2 hoopster from Hawaii had just taken his Bar exam and was celebrating with Michelle Robinson at dinner. The waiter brought over a dessert tray. On it was an engagement ring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They married in 1992 and settled in Hyde Park, a historic, affluent Chicago neighborhood. The Obamas have two daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious roots raise doubts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama was born Aug. 4, 1961, in Honolulu. He was named for his black father, a former goat herder from Kenya who had won a scholarship to the University of Hawaii. His white mother, Ann Dunham, had grown up in Kansas and moved to Hawaii with her parents. The couple met in college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When his son was a toddler, the elder Barack Obama went to study at Harvard, then returned to Kenya. In his presidential campaign, the candidate has described his loss stemming from the subsequent divorce of his parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My father left when I was 2. I only saw him once after that,&quot; Obama said in a radio ad in South Carolina. &quot;It's hard to heal that hole in your heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chubby lad called Barry Obama did have a doting grandfather. Stanley Dunham - &quot;Gramps&quot; to his grandson and his grandson's friends alike - &quot;loved that little boy,&quot; Neil Abercrombie, then a family friend and now a Democratic congressman from Hawaii, told the Chicago Tribune. &quot;In the absence of his father, there was not a kinder, more understanding man than Stanley Dunham.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madelyn Dunham, the maternal grandmother whom Barry called &quot;Toot,&quot; was equally devoted, if more reserved than Gramps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She has really been the rock, the foundation of the family,&quot; Obama said last week on CBS' The Early Show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His grandmother, a retired bank employee, is seriously ill after breaking her hip. Obama, who was too late in visiting his mother before her death, does not want a similar family tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His grandfather died in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama was 6, his mother married Lolo Soetoro, a foreign student at the University of Hawaii, and the family went to live in his homeland of Indonesia. During his four years there, the boy first attended a Roman Catholic school, then a secular school with a predominantly Muslim student body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four decades later, this period in his life would raise questions about the presidential candidate's religious roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was not raised in a particularly religious household. My father, who I didn't know, returned to Kenya when I was just 2. He was nominally a Muslim since there were a number of Muslims in the village where he was born. But by the time he was a young adult, he was an atheist,&quot; Obama said in a speech last year. &quot;My mother, whose parents were non-practicing Baptists and Methodists, was one of the most spiritual souls I ever knew. She had this enormous capacity for wonder and lived by the Golden Rule. But she had a healthy skepticism of religion as an institution. And as a consequence, so did I.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he was introduced to Jesus Christ in the mid-1980s by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, then pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ on Chicago's South Side. But the candidate and his wife resigned from the church during the 2008 presidential primary season after Wright and others were found to have made racially charged comments from the pulpit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of his sermons, Wright said blacks should sing &quot;God damn America&quot; rather than God Bless America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn America for as long as she acts like she is God and she is supreme,&quot; the preacher said in 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obamas renounced such remarks in their letter of resignation. The candidate said the decision to leave was made with &quot;some sadness&quot; because &quot;Trinity was where I found Jesus Christ.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama was 10, his mother took him back to Hawaii from Indonesia, and they moved in again with his grandparents. On a scholarship, he entered the fifth grade of Punahou School, a private academy in Honolulu attended by children of the islands' elite families. When his mother returned to Indonesia to live with her husband, Obama remained at the school and with his grandparents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his memoir, Dreams From My Father, Obama wrote about inner turmoil over his racial identity at Punahou, where most of the other students were white or Asian. However, outwardly, he got along well with his classmates. He played varsity basketball - earning the nickname &quot;Barry O'Bomber&quot; because of his long-distance jump shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He walks between worlds,&quot; Maya Soetoro-Ng, his half sister, told The Associated Press. &quot;That's what he's done his entire life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has recalled drinking beer and smoking marijuana and snorting &quot;maybe a little blow,&quot; or cocaine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Junkie. Pothead. That's where I'd been headed&quot; before straightening up, Obama wrote in his memoir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After graduation from Punahou, he entered Occidental College in Los Angeles. There Barry became Barack, and the party boy and playground jock became a social activist. After two years, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City, where he graduated with a degree in political science in 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He worked in private business in New York for a year before moving to Chicago and becoming director of a community development project for poor people on the South Side. He entered Harvard Law School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Yes, we can! Yes, we can!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a long way, geographically and culturally, from the South Side of Chicago to the picturesque Virginia park where the shadows lengthened Wednesday in the fading sunlight. The journey included service as an Illinois state legislator. A failed race for the U.S. House. A successful run for the U.S. Senate. A tough campaign against New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton to win the Democratic nomination for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now less than two weeks from a historic presidential election - with a lead in the polls against Arizona Sen. John McCain, the Republican nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most importantly, he represents change,&quot; said Albert Pickeral, a businessman from Fairfax, Va., at the rally to demonstrate his support. &quot;And I like that he has energized the youth&quot; to get interested in politics and government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe in you,&quot; Obama told the crowd. &quot;I believe in the American people. I believe we are the United States of America, a nation that faced down war and the Depression, great challenges and great threats, and with each and every moment, we've always risen to meet these challenges, not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, we can! Yes, we can!&quot; chanted the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later came the lyrics of Brooks &amp; Dunn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only in America. Where we dream as big as we want to,&quot; they sang. &quot;We all get a chance. Everybody gets to dance. Only in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;His work as a Chicago community organizer was a foundation for organizing his campaign.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1980s, a handful of African-American community organizers worked on Chicago's South Side. When veteran organizer Harold Lucas heard there was a new one, he figured he had better check him out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucas weaved through hundreds of people who had gathered at the Lilydale First Baptist Church to pressure government officials to clean polluted local water. Lucas sidled up to the skinny kid with big ears who was poring over a clipboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucas didn't say a word, but peered at the young man's clipboard. On it he saw speakers' names, stick-figure drawings, scripts of speeches and backup speakers and scripts in case people froze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was literally orchestrating the meeting from a clipboard in the back of the room,&quot; said Lucas, 65, who now runs a preservation tourism business in a historic downtown area called Bronzeville. &quot;I said to myself: Either I don't know nothing about community organizing, or this kid is brilliant.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kid was Barack Obama, a 24-year-old outsider from Hawaii who arrived in Chicago's South Side in 1985 with a political science degree from Columbia University. Obama was there to run a small church-based group created to help those with no political voice pressure government to address dire poverty and pollution that defined a public housing project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has often said in speeches, and in his book, that he got more out of his three years in community organizing than the neighborhoods got out of him. Indeed, Obama's victories on Chicago's South Side were modest, but he has drawn heavily on what he learned as a community organizer to create, in some ways, a new kind of presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His much-lauded and record-shattering fundraising operation ($600-million so far) relies heavily on tapping an expanse of small givers, a strategy often used by community groups to raise money. And his widespread national campaign is run by staff members who were trained in the ways of community outreach by the same Chicago organizers Obama worked for years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Republicans, most notably vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, poked fun at Obama's community organizing during the party's national convention. Since then, Sen. John McCain's campaign has questioned Obama's ties to Chicago organizers and his work as an attorney for one of the nation's largest, most successful (and sometimes controversial) community organizations, ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those who knew Obama during his organizing years say his experience on Chicago's South Side helped him figure out what he wanted to do with his life, choosing public service over fiction writing. It led him to law school and down a path to the Democratic Party's nomination for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Creating influence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After graduating from Columbia, Obama couldn't find an organizing job right away, so he worked as a researcher for a consulting house for a year in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama wished he could have been a civil rights organizer, but he was nearly two decades too late. So he chased community organizing jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community organizing draws its roots from the labor union movement. What labor unions did for the workplace, community organizers aimed to do for neighborhoods. The idea is to gather people who don't have access to power and money, and with sheer numbers create influence to attack problems as broad as poverty or as narrow as installing sewer hookups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's mentors learned the methods of Saul Alinsky, the Chicago father of community organizing and well-known agitator from the 1930s through the 1970s. But Obama didn't care for Alinsky's more confrontational approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack was willing to challenge power, but he was very reticent to use any personal confrontation,&quot; said Jerry Kellman, who in 1985 was looking for someone to run a new community organization for him on the South Side. &quot;Civility was and is very important to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Kellman got Obama's resume, via a costly ad in the New York Times, he had already interviewed and rejected a number of applicants. He needed someone willing to work for next-to-nothing. (Starting salary was $10,000 a year with a $2,000 bonus for a car, although the salary would increase over time.) But he also needed someone whose idealism wouldn't dissolve with a first, second or third setback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People burn out with frustration ... especially people who had been very successful academically. Suddenly they'd meet something they couldn't succeed at, and they'd not only fail, they'd unravel emotionally,&quot; said Kellman, 58, who left community organizing to go to divinity school and now works as a counselor for Catholic churches on Chicago's North Side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Kellman was also looking to hire an African-American person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kellman's group was comprised mostly of suburban white Catholic churches that had just started an offshoot called the Developing Communities Project, aimed at helping impoverished, and largely African-American, neighborhoods on the South Side. But Kellman and his colleagues were having trouble making connections with those churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kellman flew to New York, a trip initially scheduled to visit his parents in Manhattan, and interviewed Obama face-to-face and offered him the job on the spot. Obama accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the South Side Chicago residents who first met Obama were struck by his youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My first impression was: He was very young. Is he even going to be up to this task?&quot; said Loretta Augustine-Herron, a Developing Communities Project board member whose own son was about the same age as Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama quickly won the board over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He seemed to be able to understand what we were up against. He listened. And some of the things he didn't understand, he said he didn't understand,&quot; Augustine-Herron said. &quot;We liked that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relaying stories</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spent most of his time with church leaders and residents throughout the South Side, talking and interviewing them to discover their needs and &quot;self-interests.&quot; He was looking for a common thread, a topic he could get them to rally around and push for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the bread-and-butter work of community organizing that must be done before the more dramatic events of rallies and marches. It also was the part of the job Obama enjoyed. He liked hearing people's stories, and he liked writing them up, said Kellman and organizer Mike Kruglik, who also worked with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama would turn in field reports that read like stories. At the time, he also was writing fiction in his free time and was weighing a future as a writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Understanding story narratives was very key,&quot; Kellman said. &quot;He was already inclined to narratives, so he was very good at that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In setting up his presidential campaign, Obama turned to these same techniques. Kruglik spent countless weekends over the 2007 primary season training campaign workers and volunteers how to be community organizers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He'd tell volunteers, 'Don't do all the talking. Listen to people. Ask questions. If they tell you they don't support Obama, ask them why. It can help us be more responsive,'&quot; said Kruglik, 66, a blunt-spoken, gruff man who works in downtown Chicago for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizing Altgeld</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama learned about poverty at a public housing project called Altgeld Gardens, which lies as far South as Chicago's borders stretch. The community, built on a landfill, was created for returning African-American war veterans in 1945. The 1,500 two-story red brick homes look more like old-style military barracks than row houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public housing community could not be more isolated. It's a few miles from any other South Side neighborhood in an area dotted with train tracks, power lines, aged industrial buildings and a rusting metal bridge. It's sandwiched between Interstate 94 and a polluted Calumet River. A rank-smelling water sewage treatment plant also graces its borders. Grassy, treeless hills that tower above the community are growing landfills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pollution is so concentrated that it attracts toxic tours by out-of-state university research groups, say residents like Cheryl Johnson, who runs People for Community Recovery, an environmental activist group based at Altgeld Gardens that her mother, Hazel Johnson, started in the 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many children who live at Altgeld Gardens wheeze with asthma. And many who have lived there lost relatives to cancer. Johnson's father died of lung cancer. Augustine-Herron, who lived there in the 1960s, lost a 7-year-old daughter to cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, Obama worked in Altgeld Gardens with an unbridled sense of optimism, even when he could count few victories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Altgeld is the wildest place you had ever seen,&quot; said the Rev. Michael Evans, who helped run the Developing Communities Project, right after Obama left. &quot;But Obama came out there and said, 'No, this is good. We can do something with this.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often just getting residents to show up for meetings to talk about problems at the local church basement could be a challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people are overwhelmed with their own problems,&quot; Kruglik said, &quot;and at the same time, you're encouraging them to think of a better life and better way that they can create to get out of their problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeking opportunity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama had a few victories. As factories closed, the South Side had become populated with many unemployed factory workers, and Obama organized Altgeld Gardens residents to pressure the Mayor's Office of Employment and Training to open a new intake center. It ended up opening in nearby Roseland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also helped organize Altgeld Gardens residents to meet with public officials and pressure the city to remove asbestos insulation from pipes. The city didn't start removing the asbestos until after Obama left Chicago. And there's some debate as to how much credit Obama deserves for the accomplishment, which he writes about extensively in his memoir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheryl Johnson said her mother, Hazel Johnson, had started pushing to clean up asbestos at Altgeld Gardens years before Obama came to town. Hazel Johnson's environmental work has been recognized by President Bill Clinton and the first PresidentBush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She knew the problem. She has lived through it and seen it. She doesn't want any one person taking the credit,&quot; Cheryl Johnson, 47, said of her mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one was surprised when Obama left for law school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kellman said Obama realized the limits of community organizing when it comes to addressing larger, systematic problems like economic issues or racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Frankly, I was always on the lookout to see if he'd be gone, he had a lot of opportunities,&quot; Kellman said. &quot;Something had to happen. He either had to fail or succeed in order to leave. And he succeeded pretty well, and that's why he left. By succeeding, he was able to see the limitations of what could be expectations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kruglik sees Obama's departure differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kruglik says that on the presidential campaign trail, Obama often talks about the &quot;world as it is and the world as it should be,&quot; and how he's fighting to make the world as it &quot;should be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama pulled that phrase straight out of community organizing training, Kruglik says. He sees Obama's campaign, and its community organizing tactics, as an experiment for an Obama presidency. But he adds, there's still a place for organizers to hold Obama accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is combining the vision of a better world with the practicality and reality of community organizing that it takes to get that better world,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better Off Eight Years Later</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I looked it up, and our household income has doubled since George Bush took office in 2000. We have a mortgage, some credit card debt and a student loan to pay back, but we do a budget each month and try very hard to stick to it. My wife went back to school, with a student loan, to become a teacher, a profession that requires her to give much more than she receives (in money).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we better off than eight years ago? You bet. Is it because of the president? I've paid less in taxes and prospered more, but it has been the product of our own household choices as much as anything else, the same as every household.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please don't promise me $1000 if you become president. That's not going to turn any house around. Choices and hard work will do that. If some take that $1000 and &quot;stimulate&quot; the economy by buying HD TVs instead of paying down their debt, we are no better off than before. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is clearly not the brightest guy who has ever held the office, but after all is said and done, he was and is our guy. Though not without dispute, hanging chads and all, we gave him the job, not once, but twice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He brought this nation together in very unsettling times. Just a few short years ago we hung on every clumsy word. He made us feel safe. He made us feel strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today we pelt our guy with stones and deny our previous support. Though we cannot pretend to understand how to do that enormous job, we like to think we do. It's a way for us to vent our anger and frustration for what has happened with the war and the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's our way to lash-out in anger over things gone wrong. But we have to remember that with all his imperfections he was and is our guy. We asked him to do his best, and by God he tried, clearly without a net, and ultimately without support. He never allowed our opinion to sway what he felt was right in his gut, maybe to a fault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a good man! He is our good man. Thanks W. Thanks for giving us you're very best. Thanks for being our guy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's History</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being a broker in Tampa Bay for 32 years, I have listened to all the talking heads ad-nausium. Since now retired, every day's headlines capture me, not by what they say, but what they don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market is down big-time for so many reasons. The market is scared witless that NObama might win. Anyone want their retirement account to tank.more? Good thing though: Even Democrats can vote for McCain behind the curtain and lie about it to their friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac caused it all. I stopped buying Fannie in 1997 because it was only an empty shell at that time. I believe the sudden realization was politically timed to embarrass and place blame with the current administration so the next doesn't get painted with it. All congressmen squealing the loudest turned a blind eye when they allowed constituents to buy something they could not afford and mortgate it to the hilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was because of Wall Street greed. Since Fannie and Freddie could no longer handle what the government wanted to happen, they went to Wall Street asking for a mechanism and Wall Streetcame through for them. Only problem: Who was going to be the final sucker to buy, and who knew what they were buying?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's all Bush's fault. Congress controls the money. Were House members and senators only rubberstamping what Bush wanted? I don't think so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new president-elect will do everything he told us. Our elected Congress and the senators will do their duty to make sure nothing too good or bad gets rubberstamped because somewhere deep down they care - at least about being re-elected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courting Disaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Carter said he would cut taxes, but he raised them. Bill Clinton said he would cut taxes, and he raised them. Barack Obama said he would cut taxes, but he'll raise them just like every other Democrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herbert Hoover said he would cut taxes, and he raised them and increased government spending, which drove America into the Great Depression. Obama said he would increase government spending by $1 trillion. That would drive America into a Second Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tax and spend Democrat president and a tax and spend Democrat Congress would spell disaster for the U.S..economy. Americans got into this financial mess by spending outside their means. We don't need more government spending; we need less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't need bigger government; we need a smaller, more streamlined efficient government. We don't need a federal socialistic welfare state to redistribute our wealth; we do need a well-managed free enterprise system that encourages growth and prosperity through American ingenuity and hard work.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama says &quot;Don't wait until November 4th!&quot; to vote. That's because the true meaning of his &quot;change&quot; mantra is losing him votes. We now know that Obama's change is taking money from those who work and &quot;spreading the wealth&quot; to those who don't. Thank you, Joe Plumber, for your service to the American voter!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic Solutions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way to get out of our present economic mess is the opposite of Obama's calls for class warfare, punishing the &quot;rich&quot; and creeping socialism. The answer is rapid economic growth and loosening the American economy to increase productivities and all incomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the war, America has had to be content with 3 and 4 percent annual growth, while Europe is happy with 1 and 2 percent.With our challenges, from entitlements, deficits, the financial crisis and the war, along with our desires for affordable health care, we'll need to aim much higher to solve them all!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll need to set our sights on 8 percent growth, without inflation, and as Ronald Reagan once said, &quot;Jump aboard, hold your hat and relish the sweep of the wind as it rushes by.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To loosen this juggernaut, we'll need a major shrinking of government and tax rates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Tax Rebate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a recent budget workshop, I asked this question many times: &quot;What can we do to make these tough times easier for Joe, the average citizen?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe there are several things county government can and should do to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, we can use our capital budget to help stimulate the local economy. Expediting roads and other construction projects already funded will create new jobs and keep people employed. Second, we can do what Joe and his family are doing: We can set spending priorities and focus on providing only essential services. The third thing we can do right now is give money back. We don't have to spend every dime we collect. And just because we save a few million here and there doesn't mean we have to find new ways to spend it. That is why I proposed returning to our taxpayers what looked like $20 to $50 million of savings from certain projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, state law does not allow a county to return taxes, and fortunately my fellow commissioners joined me and unanimously agreed in September to ask the state Legislature for that authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every citizen in Hillsborough County needs a financial break in these times. That is why I will continue to pursue a tax rebate whenever our budget allows, and particularly when financial conditions demand it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Add Recycling Bins</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recycling in public schools has been on my mind for a long time. Every day I see hundreds of kids who use soda cans, plastic bottles and paper plates that end up in the trash. Recycling bins in our schools would allow a large amount of waste to be recycled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recycling is a simple initiative that can be put in place to teach kids about proper waste disposal. If kids are taught when they are young to help preserve our environment by recycling, we would enjoy a much cleaner environment in years to come.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least now I know who to vote for. (Heather) Florentino says the logistics of classroom-by-classroom limits are unrealistic. I have heard this bull for over 40 years, and it is a way to NOT support teachers. Anyone that knows anything about anything about class size knows that small classes help teachers to control their class. It helps teachers individualize instruction, as well as team teaching. It helps teachers in grading papers. It helps in planning. It helps teacher morale and encourages class discussion for every student. I could go on and on, but I will </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stop. I fire Fiorentino and hire Stephen Donaldson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I grew up in Zephyrhills and graduated in 1965. I have just retired from teaching (36 years) in the Atlanta area and seven years inMiami. It is time for someone to step up and walk the walk and spend the money to get it done!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a worker for the McCain/Palin campaign, I have placed numerous four-by-eight McCain/Palin signs in Central Pasco on private property alongmajor roadways. Recently, a sign was vandalized by what appeared to be bullet holes and torn from its wooden frame and slashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama supported the gun ban in Washington, D.C., and has supported laws that erode our Second Amendment rights, so it stands to reason that the Obama camp wasn't behind the use of our sign for target practice. Since private property rights, for the most part, are supported by our Constitution and therefore respected by most civil and lawabiding citizens of these United States, I am led to believe that the defacing of this campaign material on private property was perpetrated by a simple nonpartisan ignoramus. Note to ignoramus: It is illegal to deface, destroy, vandalize or steal campaign material.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UAW's socialism ruined industrial Michigan. Now to their retirees here who have deserted those ruins, they tell them to do the same throughout the country! (&quot;Demand, strike and spend like there is no tomorrow, and tax businesses and the rich until they disappear.&quot;) The UAW forced the Big Three to price themselves out of the auto market and destroyed that once dominant industry and the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know because I managed two businesses in that socialistic economy where businesses were taxed-not on profits, but sales!

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starting from a popular blue-collar beach, Republican John McCain barnstormed through Central Florida on Thursday, casting himself as the defender of small businesses and a fighter for regular Joes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't spend the next four years as we have spent much of the last eight, hoping for our luck to change at home and abroad,&quot; McCain said. &quot;We need a new direction and we have to fight for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a Puerto Rican restaurant in one of Orlando's growing Hispanic communities to a farmers market in Hillsborough County, one of the state's largest swing counties, McCain spent most of the day rounding up as many &quot;Joe the Plumbers&quot; as he could find. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain started his &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; tour at the Starlite Cafe in Daytona Beach. At a rally in an Ormond Beach lumberyard, he referred to his campaign's anti-tax symbol eight times in the first six minutes of his speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please raise your hand if you're in small business here,&quot; he said. &quot;You have the same dream Joe the Plumber has.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a diversion from his everyman message, McCain was asked about reports that the Republican National Committee had spent $150,000 on clothes and hairstyling for his running mate, Sarah Palin, and her family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She needed the clothes at the time,&quot; McCain said in an interview with The Palm Beach Post and four other Florida news outlets. &quot;The clothes will be donated to charity. ... They don't pay for my clothes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain first crafted a populist economic message around an Ohio plumber during the third debate with Barack Obama, hoping to paint his Democratic rival as a tax-and-spend liberal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain warned crowds in Ormond Beach and Sarasota that Obama would lead the country into another Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign shot back Thursday, saying McCain would continue Bush administration economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain hasn't offered a single thing that he would do differently from George W. Bush on the economy or foreign policy,&quot; Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With most polls predicting a close race, McCain called Florida &quot;a battleground state we've got to win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Charlie Crist offered help by recording a radio ad that promotes McCain's anti-tax message. Crist, who endorsed McCain in the state's presidential primary, traveled with McCain on Thursday, leading chants of &quot;USA! USA!&quot; in Ormond Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also tried the strawberry shortcake at Parkesdale Farm Market in Plant City and visited Mi Viejo San Juan in Orlando and Coatoam Periodontal in Altamonte Springs before flying to Colorado Thursday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Obama received the brunt of the criticism, McCain also targeted President Bush, demanding action on his campaign plan to buy bad mortgages from homeowners who can no longer afford their payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's realize the American dream,&quot; McCain said, pounding on a podium set up amid stacks of plywood at All Star Building Materials in Ormond Beach. &quot;I call on the administration to act now and buy up these home loan mortgages and keep people in their homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some fiscal conservatives have criticized McCain's mortgage plan, but he defended the idea Thursday, saying it would prevent additional foreclosures and help protect home values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Which would you rather do? Bail out the banks? The co-conspirators?&quot; he said in the interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain surrounded himself throughout the day with small-business owners, including Richard River, owner of A Floral Boutique Florist in Daytona Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His name is Richard, but he's Joe the Florist,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The senator crosses the state, shoring up support and hammering Obama.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With time running out and trouble in the polls, John McCain barnstormed Central Florida on Thursday, warning voters that Barack Obama &quot;will say anything to get elected,&quot; then crush small businesses and the jobs they provide by raising taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a nod to Florida's hard-hit housing market, McCain also highlighted his proposal for the government to take over shaky mortgages and let homeowners refinance at affordable rates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I call on the administration to act now and buy up these home-loan mortgages and keep people in their homes,&quot; McCain told cheering supporters at an Ormond Beach building supply yard, which has laid off 130 of its 180 employees because of the housing slump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And why isn't the secretary of the Treasury ordering them to do that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an interview Thursday as his bus, the Straight Talk Express, rolled west on Interstate 4, McCain defended the idea on grounds that foreclosures hurt surrounding home values. He also said many people were guided into unaffordable loans by unscrupulous mortgage brokers and deserve help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's always a personal responsibility. There's also such a thing as shell games, and such a thing as treating people like suckers, and taking advantage of people who don't have the knowledge and background to handle such things,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters also asked about news this week that the Republican National Committee spent $150,000 outfitting Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin shortly after she became his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She needed clothes at the time. They'll be donated at end of this campaign. They'll be donated to charity,&quot; McCain said curtly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he was surprised at the amount spent, McCain said, &quot;Nothing surprises me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the RNC buys his clothes, he said, &quot;No, they do not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While at least one recent poll shows McCain slightly leading Obama in Florida, several more show him trailing. The fact he held his last rally of the day in Sarasota, a Republican stronghold, hints at the campaign's concerns, though McCain expressed confidence as he campaigned with Gov. Charlie Crist and U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez. The campaign also began airing a new radio ad featuring Crist warning that Obama will raise taxes and hurt small businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have energized volunteers,&quot; McCain said. &quot;Well get our vote out. We'll get it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trip from Daytona Beach to Sarasota was dubbed the &quot;Joe the Plumber Keep Your Wealth&quot; tour, and McCain spent most of his time in rallies, interviews and meetings with small business owners arguing that Obama's goal is to &quot;spread the wealth&quot; - a line that always draws boos - by raising taxes for those clearing at least $200,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama is more interested in controlling who gets a piece of the pie than he is in growing the pie,&quot; McCain told about 3,500 people at a boisterous rally in Sarasota. &quot;Sen. Obama may say he is trying to soak the rich, but a lot of the middle class is going to get wet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Plant City, McCain greeted crowds at Parksdale Farms, a rambling open air produce, sundae and Florida tchotchke stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing buoyant, McCain rushed to the fencing separating him from the crowds, shaking hands with fans who occasionally broke into chants of &quot;Go, McCain, Go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, with Crist, McCain ducked inside the stand and started shaking hands with the staff before being led through the store by its owner, Jim Meeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He shook hands with shoppers who seemed alternately stunned and thrilled. Spying a gentleman wearing a cap declaring, &quot;USS Submarine Veteran,&quot; McCain reached out his hand and said, &quot;Thanks for your service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you, too,&quot; replied James Tagliarini, 67, of Plant City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain worked his way through the store while being trailed by a young woman carrying a tray of strawberry shortcakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She set it down at a long table where McCain joined several small business owners, and the senator appeared to get a dab of whipped cream on his finger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He licked it off. &quot;Boy, that stuff,&quot; he said. &quot;These low-cal meals. ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He looked pretty happy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One nugget from a spot on NYT story (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/25/us/politics/25florida.html?_r=1&amp;ref=politics&amp;oref=slogin) about McCain-Palin underestimating Barack Obama's potential in Fla:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even several state Republicans said they saw evidence that Mr. Obama was bringing new and highly effective methods to the state to find voters and turn them out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've gotten seven calls from live Obama volunteers - and the reason I'm getting calls is because I signed up on their Web site to get notifications from their campaign,&quot; said Sally Bradshaw, a Republican who was a senior political adviser to Jeb Bush, the former governor. Ms. Bradshaw, who supported Mitt Romney in the primary, had signed up for the list to keep informed about a rival. &quot;I haven't received any McCain calls,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not exactly a shocker, but here's (http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/article870039.ece) the recommendation from the editorial board of Florida's largest newspaper: &quot;These are uncertain times. Americans' confidence in our leaders and institutions has been shaken by a failing economy, lengthy wars and an erosion of civil liberties. We feel uneasy about our personal financial security, the country's place in the world and what the future holds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Frankly, after eight disastrous years under President Bush, either John McCain or Barack Obama would be a significant improvement and offer more reassuring leadership. But one candidate offers a clearer break with the past, the qualities to unite this country and the vision to lead it in a new direction. With enthusiasm, the Times recommends Barack Obama for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech could have been given today. But three years ago, Rep.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young faces belonged to students at Florida A&amp;M and Florida State University, and if the buttons and stickers on their backpacks are any guide, they voted for Obama.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after three terms in Washington and a fateful overseas golf junket, a once-rising Republican star could be finished. Stigmatized by his ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff, Feeney is a symbol of the tarnished Republican brand in this volatile election year.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida Democratic Party has launched a Web site called Dangerous Detert(http://www.dangerousdetert.com/), that highlights Nancy Detert's sponsorship, when the Republican was in the Florida House in 2002, of a bill that would have allowed drunk drivers who lost their driver's licenses to get their licenses back in certain circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill(http://www.flsenate.gov/session/index.cfm?BI_Mode=ViewBillInfo&amp;Mode=Bills&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;Year=2002&amp;billnum=211) went nowhere, had no Senate companion and didn't even get a legislative analysis.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coping with 'a rush of voters'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Election supervisors told the state Friday they're coping with the flood of early voters well, but that they never expected this many people to turn out. As of Thursday night, 608,796 people had cast early ballots or more than 5-percent of the statewide electorate of 11-million. Early voting ends Sunday, Nov. 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we're all experiencing is just a rush of voters that we could not have anticipated. No one could have anticipated that this election would be so historic and draw as much attention as it has,&quot; said Broward elections supervisor Brenda Snipes, who posts wait times on her web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snipes and Sarasota's Kathy Dent voiced opposition to expanding early voting hours next week because it would cause logistical problems. Secretary of State Kurt Browning told them in a conference call that he has no plans to expand it, despite a plea from all nine Democratic members of Congress in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other developments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The state will not post any returns on its web site before 8 p.m. EST on Nov. 4, because most of the Panhandle is in central time and Browning doesn't want projections of winners and losers to influence voters who are still voting. This is believed to be the first time the state is withholding some election results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Hillsborough County's Kathy Harris had a testy exchange with Browning on whether the county needs state approval to &quot;deviate&quot; from state directives and verify voters' identities at the polls on Election Day. &quot;You don't need my authority, nor will I grant that authority,&quot; Browning replied tersely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Pinellas Supervisor Deborah Clark wants an expedited OK from the state so she can begin a machine recount in a close race as soon as possible after Election Night. Browning said no but that the state is prepared &quot;to do whatever we can&quot; to avoid recount delays.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC News: A prominent fundraiser for Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign is facing a new legal challenge over a lucrative Pentagon contract that involved shipping oil to military forces in Iraq. A competing firm filed a federal suit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act this week against the fundraiser, Harry Sargeant III, and his company, International Oil Trading Company. The suit accuses them of a &quot;bribery scheme&quot; to pay officials in the Kingdom of Jordan, in an effort to keep competing firms out. Sargeant and his company deny wrongdoing and say no bribes were paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sargeant is the Finance Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, a key state in the upcoming presidential election. The federal lawsuit is the latest case to bring attention to him. NBC News first reported last May that Sargeant was awarded the Pentagon contract even though he was not the lowest bidder. NBC reported he was being sued in Florida state court by a former business partner who was the brother-in-law of the King of Jordan. More background here. (http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/article858448.ece) (Photo: Sargeant, center, with Gov. Charlie Crist during a trade mission in 2007.) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Times poll: Obama 49, McCain 42</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent Florida voters are on the verge of killing John McCain's hopes for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new St. Petersburg Times/Bay News 9/Miami Herald poll shows Barack Obama leading McCain 49 percent to 42 percent in this state McCain cannot afford to lose. The biggest factor? Less partisan independent voters moving to Obama by a margin of more than 2 to 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now this election is about independents - independents and the economy,'' said pollster Tom Eldon.&quot;Obama is clearly establishing himself as the candidate of the independents.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when economic anxiety trumps all issues in Florida, about half of the voters surveyed - and almost 6 in 10 independents - said Obama has a better plan to improve the economy, while one in three voters say McCain does. Forty-five percent said Obama has shown the most leadership on the economy, and 34 percent said McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The predominant color in Florida right now is neither blue nor red, it's green,&quot; said pollster Kellyanne Conway. &quot;The financial concerns, money concerns, dominate voters' calculus.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conway, whose company works mostly with Republicans, questioned the effectiveness of McCain's recent campaign strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trying to connect Barack Obama to Bill Ayers, rather than connect McCain to the average voter in the economy has ... been dubious,'' she said, referring to the 1960s radical Obama knows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The telephone survey of 800 registered voters was conducted Oct. 20-22, for the Times, Bay News 9 and Miami Herald. The poll was done by Schroth Eldon &amp; Associates, whose clients primarily are Democrats, and the Polling Co., which mainly works with Republicans. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is virtually impossible for McCain to win the presidency without Florida's 27 electoral votes, and the poll suggests Florida remains within reach for the Arizona senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eldon noted that McCain needs to boost his lagging numbers in traditional Republican strongholds including southwest Florida, one of the most economically devastated areas of the state. Florida's top battleground of Tampa Bay is predictably close with the poll showing Obama with 48 percent support and McCain with 44 percent, within the margin of error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain leads Florida Hispanic voters 47 percent to 40 percent, while 86 percent of African-Americans back Obama. McCain leads 49 percent to 43 percent among white voters overall, but Obama has an 11-point lead among women and is nearly tied with McCain among men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among voters 65 and older, McCain and Obama are in a dead heat, with 11 percent still undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there's any more fluidness left in this race - and God knows there probably is because this is 2008 and nothing predictable - it may rest with these seniors,'' said Conway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of thousands of voters already have voted in Florida, either by absentee ballot or at early voting sites, and McCain and Obama were tied among people who already had voted. Forty-four percent of those polled said they intended to vote on Election Day, 15 percent by mail, 37 percent at early voting sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, of the more than 800,000 people who have voted by absentee ballot, Republicans have an advantage of nearly 130,000. But of the more than 482,000 who voted early between Monday and Wednesday, 55 percent were Democrats and 30 percent Republican, a net advantage of 117,000 for Democrats.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hitting mailboxes this week is a Republican Party of Florida piece attacking Barack Obama as soft on crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wait, that's putting it too mildly. The mailer casts Obama as a friend to crack users, street gangs and child abusers. The Obama campaign called the flier, &quot;not only false&quot; but hypocritical and points out that McCain voted against increasing funding for police. Full statement in jump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama response: &quot;That outrageous mailer is not only false, it's hypocritical given that John McCain has repeatedly voted against increasing funding for cops and equipment and technology for law enforcement. He even voted against a ban on cop-killer bullets. The truth is that Barack Obama has a strong record on strengthening law enforcement and, as President, would fully fund the COPS program that would put an additional 50,000 officers on the streets and fund the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program, which has been critical to creating the anti-gang and anti-drug task forces our communities need to name just a few things. Americans are tired of same old negative politics that McCain is running on, and this mailer is just one more reason why Floridians are voting for change with Barack Obama and Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As his Joe the Plumber Keep Your Wealth Tour rolled down the I-4 corridor from Daytona Beach toward a 6 p.m. rally in Sarasota, Sen. John McCain took a little time to chat with Buzz and a few fellow Florida reporters in the wood-paneled cabin of the Straight Talk Express.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a new Quinnipiac Poll shows him down 5 points among those who already have voted in Florida, McCain and his traveling companions -- Gov. Charlie Crist and U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez -- were buoyed by a recent Mason-Dixon poll showing him up by 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of it's going to depend on voter turnout. We've got to campaign hard here, and we all know it's a battleground state,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having just left a boisterous rally of more than 1,000 in Ormond Beach, McCain added, &quot;We have energized volunteers. We'll get our vote out. We'll get it out. ... I'm confident that people are energized in this race, and I expect that energy will translate into&quot; a win in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and his pals are stopping at small businesses along the way. He visited a periodontal clinic in Altamonte Springs and had lunch at Mi Viejo San Juan, a Puerto Rican restaurant in Orlando.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Charlie Justice, a St. Petersburg Democrat, wants Pinellas Supervisor of Elections Deborah Clark (a Republican) to add more early voting sites. In an op-ed circulated to Florida newspapers, Justice notes that Pinellas has three early voting sites and that more are needed: &quot;We do need more sites and we need them strategically placed,&quot; writes the member of the Senate Ethics &amp; Elections Committee.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his blog, Rep.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain launches Joe the Plumber Tour</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Sen. John McCain kicked off his Joe the Plumber Bus Tour in Florida this morning by having coffee with four small-business owners at the Starlite Diner in Daytona Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain emerged from his bus at 8:37 and headed inside, followed closely by Cindy McCain and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, who turned to the assembled scribes, smiled brightly and delivered a little finger-shoot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once inside, the dynamic trio moved to a corner booth surrounding a round table, where four small-business owners awaited with coffee. Diners at neighboring tables manned their cell phone cameras as the business owners told McCain their troubles, particularly with Obama's tax plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Payroll taxes will kill me,&quot; Richard Rivers, owner of A Floral Boutique Florist in Daytona Beach, told McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rivers has had to cut back on hours for employees, and is now looking at cutting insurance benefits to avoid laying anyone off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama raises the payroll taxes, I'll have to cut extra hours, so your message is really resonating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their server, Brandi Andrews, of Daytona Beach posed with a picture with McCain and Crist. Cindy McCain snapped the picture. &quot;It's not every day the next first lady takes your picture,&quot; Crist said. &quot;Pretty special.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crowd gathered outside, holding up their cell phones and hoping for a shot. &quot;We both already voted for him,&quot; said Susan Traylor, 55, an office administrator at doctor's office in Loganville, Ga., who waited for a McCain sighting with her husband, Chris, a deputy sheriff. &quot;Our son and daughter already voted for him, too... Everybody in my office is voting for McCain, so don't believe all the stuff you hear on TV.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 15 minutes, at 8:52, McCain and his gang stood up and waded to the door, then boarded the Straight Talk Express for a rally with Crist and Sen. Mel Martinez at All Star Building Materials, a lumberyard in Ormond Beach that has had to lay off 130 of its 180 employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida's a battleground state. We've got to win,&quot; McCain said. &quot;We have less than two weeks. Twelve days. Who's counting? What America needs is a fighter, someone who puts all his cards on the table and trusts the judgment of the American people. I've been fighting for you all my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q poll: Obama 49, McCain 45</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quinnipiac University 10/16-21 poll (http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x2882.xml?ReleaseID=1223) has Barack Obama at 49 percent and John McCain at 45 percent, with a margin of error of +/- 2.6 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Florida, Obama's margin over McCain is due mostly from stronger support from Hispanics than Kerry received,'' said Peter Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those who say they already have voted in Florida, Obama gets 48 percent to McCain's 44 percent, a statistical tie in this smaller subgroup. Looking at all Florida likely voters, men split with 46 percent for Obama and 45 percent for McCain. Women back Obama 51 to 42 percent for McCain. The Republican leads 52 to 41 percent among white voters, 71 to 23 percent among evangelical Christians, and 51 to 40 percent among Catholics. Obama leads 49 to 39 percent among Hispanics and 77 to 20 percent among Jews. Independent voters back Obama 51 to 39 percent, similar to Oct. 1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The opinions of a randomly selected group evolve to favor the Democrat.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one batch of Tampa Bay swing voters, John McCain has already lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two months ago, the undecided voters convened for a focus group at the St. Petersburg Times were decidedly antagonistic toward Barack Obama and in several cases leaning toward McCain. Today, just one of the 11 voters is backing McCain, nine expect to vote for Obama, and one remains torn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin did most of the work of pushing them to the Democrat, but Obama also has managed to ease their doubts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've felt for a long time that the Republican Party has been captured by people who are too far (in) the extremes - the religious right, the neo-cons. I had great hopes that I could see in McCain somebody who was different. I don't see that anymore,'' said Republican retired military officer Donn Spegal, 80, of Tierra Verde. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want several things out of a president, and I think Obama has potential. Intelligence is the first one, obvious love of country and dedication. He must be a pragmatist. We haven't had enough pragmatism, and I think Obama shows that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls indicate a neck-and-neck race for Florida's 27 electoral votes, so this randomly selected group of formerly undecided voters is not necessarily a signal of which way Florida will tilt. But over three sessions of informal discussions about the election, many of the participants took remarkably similar journeys to reaching the conclusion that Obama was their candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Widespread antagonism toward Obama in mid August gave way in September to overwhelming horror over McCain picking Palin as his vice presidential nominee. At the last session last week, most were scoffing at McCain's constant talk of Joe the Plumber, still calling Palin unqualified, divisive and grating, and acknowledging that Obama has grown on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first meeting, I was absolutely against Barack Obama, up one side and down the other. He was too young, he was too inexperienced. By the second one (after Palin joined the ticket), it was like, whoa, I don't know what I'm going to do now,'' said Annette Kocsis, a 68-year-old Democrat from Clearwater, who no longer worries so much about a President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he's a more thoughtful person, more analytical than McCain,'' she said. &quot;I feel that if he's in there, he's going to get advisers. ... I'm hopeful that he'll get people who will talk back to him and say, 'You know, that's not the right thing to do.' And I just feel like that's the kind of people he'll have around him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Temple Terrace Democrat Rhonda Laris, 53, also said she favored McCain originally but came to grips with her discomfort over voting for a presidential candidate younger than her. She also said she can't stomach Palin in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And No. 3, Hillary asked me to vote for Obama,'' said Laris, a loan officer and formerly strong Hillary Rodham Clinton supporter who said even if Clinton's heart isn't behind Obama, her endorsement meant something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laris' interest in traveling abroad also helped move her to Obama: &quot;I want the world to like us again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hours spent talking politics together, these voters had come to know one another reasonably well and sense one another's apparent leanings. So when Republican Mark Sayre, 50, of St. Petersburg declared he would vote for Obama, the room erupted in gasps. For Sayre - one of the group's only Palin fans - the final debate clinched it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a very good judge of character. I've sold everything from newspapers to used cars,'' said Sayre, who concluded Obama has more integrity than McCain. &quot;Basically, you just looked at these two and you trusted Obama. I was looking at their character. I was watching them - movements, hand gestures, face. You can tell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican former professor Jim Soltis of Holiday, the lone McCain supporter, said he had initially leaned toward Obama but ultimately concluded among other things that Obama lacked the necessary experience and depth on foreign policy, and had too many controversial associations in his background. Soltis referred to the community organizing group ACORN, and suggested a President Obama could be taking advice from 1960s radical Bill Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soltis, 70, cited Clinton's campaign ad questioning whether voters would want Obama answering the red phone at 3 a.m. when an international crisis erupts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think a big difference would be, McCain would get out the six-shooter while Obama's going to pick up the phone and call somebody and ask them what they thought,'' responded Oldsmar Democrat Carlos Gonzalez, 70, another former Clinton supporter who has warmed up to Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent Riverview voter Tom Gerhart, 66, had shared Soltis' strong concerns about Obama's background, but now intends to vote for Obama anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know that I'm any less uncomfortable about the associations, but I think I have developed more respect for Obama's more positive associations, I guess,'' said Gerhart, a retired consultant and IBM staffer. &quot;The man's very bright, and I don't think I appreciated that as much as I do now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Philinia Lehr, a stay-at-home mother in Largo, acknowledged her likely vote for Obama will be unenthusiastic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Charlie Crist dashed around the state Monday to stir up support for state Republicans fighting an unprecedented TV ad barrage by the well-funded Barack Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid national speculation that Crist and the Republican Party of Florida are washing their hands of Sen. John McCain's sluggish efforts in the state, Monday's fly-around focused on local Republicans running for the state House and Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowds at the three events -- in Sarasota, West Palm Beach and Viera -- were each fewer than 100, composed mostly of local candidates and party leaders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But TV cameras and other media offered Crist the chance to focus some attention on local candidates. Crist said it is &quot;possible&quot; that Obama's campaign in the state could help other Democrats, but he said it was not likely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe so in Florida. Floridians have proven themselves to be very well-focused on individual races,&quot; he said, noting he was elected in 2006 along with Democrat Alex Sink as the state's chief financial officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist mentioned McCain at each of the three stops, but only fleetingly, devoting more time to candidates like Nancy Detert, running for an open state Senate seat in Sarasota. Crist and Republican Party of Florida Chairman Jim Greer said McCain will win in Florida. But Greer said the decisions made by the McCain campaign in Florida were being made separately from the state party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. McCain's campaign has utilized its own strategies that it's developed and the party has provided as much assistance as possible to that particular strategy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the divisive tone struck by McCain and running mate Sarah Palin in recent weeks, Greer said they were not representative of the RPOF's efforts to focus on issues and policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that Sen. McCain has to consider political strategies that are unique to his campaign and don't necessarily reflect how the governor or I as chairman feel,&quot; Greer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist was asked about the attacks from many McCain supporters that Obama is advancing a &quot;socialist&quot; agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I imagine different people have different definitions. I don't think it looks that way to me,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign is among the best-funded in Florida history with some projecting a weekly expenditure of $5 million in the closing days. The barrage of TV ads and campaign appearances by Obama's campaign has buoyed Democrat hopes that their own local candidates will benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Jotkoff, a spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party, said the party's candidates will benefit from the Obama spending and the party's voter registration efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you overlay the swing areas that Obama's efforts are focusing on with where the competitive congressional, state house, and state senate races are, they almost all line up,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publicly, Republicans say they are not concerned about an Obama-fueled turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't see that in the polls that we run,&quot; said incoming House Speaker Ray Sansom, R-Destin. &quot;Our guys in Florida are working a little bit harder because we don't know what the climate might be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detert said her polls show a &quot;certain percentage&quot; of voters will split their ticket and vote for her and Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have very smart voters. Our polling shows that Obama, no matter how well he is doing, has no coattails,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An attorney for the Florida Association of Supervisors of Elections sent a letter to supervisors statewide today weighing in on the ongoing tiff between Pinellas County Supervisor Deborah Clark and Secretary of State Kurt Browning over voter verification at the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opinion of Ron Labasky: Clark is within her right to resolve discrepancies under the &quot;No match&quot; law on Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browning, a former Pasco supervisor, has argued that matching problems need to be resolved before Election Day, and in those cases that are not the voter will be allowed to cast a provisional ballot that would count only if the discrepancies are resolved within two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labasky writes &quot;the statute does not preclude the applicant from providing that information at that time [at the polls], thereby obviating any need for subsequent contact with the supervisor, assuming that information is documented.&quot; Read the full letter here.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Charlie Crist just made a rare appearance on a McCain-Palin conference call (listen HERE) (http://blip.tv/file/1382683/), touting McCain's understanding of the economy, small-business needs, climate change and Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;has actually lived in Florida, appreciates Florida, understands our state and cares deeply about it. He understands that the people are hurting, and he understands very directly that tax cuts are the way to go. ... All of us have seen how graphically that was illustrated by the now extremely famous Joe the plumber. And I think that why that's caught on and why that's had such traction is, people can really relate to that guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

McCain in Florida. I'm confident it will happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Executive Board of Clemency granted Alan Crotzer, originally of St. Petersburg, a clean slate Tuesday, wiping from his record two prior convictions that were unrelated to the 24 years he served in prison for a crime he didn't commit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2006, Crotzer was cleared from essentially a life sentence in prison for robbery and sexual assault charges, crimes a judge cleared him of after he spent 24 years in prison. In 2008, the Legislature compensated him for the wrongful charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At clemency, an FDLE staffer said he didn't think the Clemency Board had the authority to expunge a conviction, because the Florida Supreme Court had said so back in 2004. But Gov. Charlie Crist said he thought they should move forward anyway, adding, &quot;We have a couple of new members over there. It's up to the panel.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCollum said he believes that the Cabinet overstepped its authority a few months ago when it passed an agency rule change aimed to prevent felons from serving in the mortgage industry. So he pitched this rule change, framing it as a different way to get at the same problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida Executive Board of Clemency, made up of the Cabinet, won't consider this proposed rule change until the next meeting. McCollum has been talking about this seven-year wait period for several months, and so far the Cabinet has been cool to the idea.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wbelcher@tampatrib.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you were watching the Tampa Bay Rays playoff games on TBS, then you saw dozens of commercials for &quot;Frank TV,&quot; which begins its second season at 11 tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those who missed the first season, &quot;Frank TV&quot; is a skit comedy show built around the talents of impressionist Frank Caliendo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's the chubby, round-faced comic who also turns up as various characters on Fox's NFL Sunday pre-game shows, often as an addled Andy Rooney. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also does a great John Madden, a decent Al Pacino, a pretty good Bill Clinton, a memorable Jack Nicholson, a passable John McCain and a funny George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He'll run through dozens more on his TBS series. In an interview in Beverly Hills back in July, he said that he's going to miss George W. because the guy was easy to mimic and was unintentionally comical anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If McCain becomes the next resident of the White House, Caliendo has him covered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Impressionists can latch onto his mannerism, and his 'my friends' line works for me,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caliendo recently was hired to do his McCain impression for a series of public appearances and video commercials for McCain Foods, a Canadian-based french fry company (no relation to Sen. McCain).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he's not doing Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not got that many distinct characteristics, and there's nothing defining about his voice, which is a little like Ted Koppel or an alien,&quot; he notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For &quot;Frank TV,&quot; Caliendo recruited black comic Frank Lockhart to play Obama. Lockhart also does Morgan Freeman and Samuel L. Jackson among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caliendo and his fellow impressionists already have recorded 68 skits for the new season, so his show won't be as topical as say &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the skits were taped before Sarah Palin became the Republican vice presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then it would be tough for anyone other than Tina Fey to do a Palin impression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMAZING RACERS: On a night when the Rays and the Bucs were both playing and winning in prime time, Tampa had another winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tina Greene and her estranged husband, Ken, easily raced to their third first-place finish on &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; on Sunday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tina, who runs a Tampa-based executive recruiting firm, and Ken, a former NFL player, may be the oldest team (she's 49, and he's 52), but they have emerged as the toughest one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, they have finished in first place on three out of four legs of the race. They have won trips to Mexico and to Rio de Janeiro, and matching ATVs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RITA ROCKS: Comic Nicole Sullivan seemed destined for bigger things when she was a regular on &quot;Mad TV&quot; in the late '90s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she still hasn't found the right movie or sitcom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She gets another shot on the Lifetime network's first comedy series, &quot;Rita Rocks,&quot; which is airing at 8:30 tonight through Friday before settling into a Tuesday-night run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan plays Rita Clemens, a woman in her 30s who is trying to release her inner hottie and escape her frumpy, boring suburban life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rita, a wife and mother, used to play in a Bangles cover band, so she pulls together a garage band - much to the dismay of her hubby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Sullivan should have a series that's of the same caliber as &quot;30 Rock&quot; or &quot;The New Adventures of the Old Christine,&quot; she's saddled with something that's on par with &quot;According to Jim.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he wins in November, John McCain would be the oldest president to start a first term. Public curiosity about his vitality is, well, healthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters have a right to ask about the general physical and mental condition of anyone they're considering hiring for the nation's toughest job. How much a candidate reveals should remain the candidate's choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health is a legitimate issue that can easily be turned into distasteful exaggerations, as several recent anti-McCain advertisements make clear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSNBC ran an ad that said, &quot;John McCain is 72 years old and had cancer four times. Why won't McCain release his medical records?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is deceptive and is no longer running. Actually, McCain did release 1,173 pages of his medical files earlier this year to a small group of reporters. They were allowed to inspect the documents for a few hours but were prohibited from reproducing any of the papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They found out a lot more about McCain's medicines and conditions, including his bouts with arthritis, than has been disclosed about any other candidate. Barack Obama released only an abbreviated doctor's statement saying he is the picture of health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus is entirely on McCain. The California Nurses Association has produced an ad that shows an EKG of a heartbeat while a voice sings, &quot;one heartbeat away.&quot; Then a picture of Sarah Palin appears, along with a list of scathing criticisms of McCain's running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With health so big an issue this year, some political observers are calling for a standardized medical test for all the candidates for president and vice president. It could be administered by government-approved doctors, much like the medical exams long required for airplane pilots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a test is unnecessary and would not settle medical uncertainties. Remember, the president is not a pilot flying the ship of state. It's office work with top medical care always nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An even worse idea than a standardized exam comes from some Democrats who call on McCain to open his entire medical history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Running for office should not strip a candidate of all personal privacy. Full disclosure would put so much in the public realm that it would discourage many healthy, qualified people from running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is easy to imagine, for example, what the negative advertisers would do with issues of sexual health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution is wisely minimal in its list of the qualifications for president. To run, a person must be a natural born citizen at least 35 years old and must have lived in the United States at least 14 years. It doesn't require the candidate to have a doctor's note or be able to run three miles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a candidate is being treated for cancer or coming down with Alzheimer's disease, it would be impossible to keep that a secret on the long campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's not become hypochondriacs, comparing candidates' blood pressures and prescription medicines and imagining the worst. The public has a right to have its finger on a candidate's pulse, not to review every prostate exam or Pap smear. There is a difference.</SPAN></P>

Between now and Election Day, we'll distill the candidates' positions and examine key rulings on each topic.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man found his winning message</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man opposed a flawed strategy in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, Feb. 6 in a TV ad airing in Virginia, the District of Columbia and Maryland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he has been one of the Senate's strongest and most vocal advocates of the war in Iraq, McCain has also been one of the Bush adminstration's biggest Republican critics. As far back as mid 2003, shortly after the invasion of Iraq, McCain was warning that the United States needed to send more troops to Iraq and more money to Iraq reconstruction efforts, or else face a deep and long-lasting insurgency that would threaten America's mission there. Which, of course, is exactly what happened. He was also a strident critic of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, telling interviewers that he lacked confidence in Rumsfeld as far back as 2004 - meaty criticism for a top Republican on the Armed Services Committee. &quot;There's not enough (troops), and we are in a very serious situation, in my view, a race against time. We need to spend a whole lot more money to get the services back to the people. We need to get the electricity going, the fuel, the water. And unless we get that done and get it done pretty soon, we could face a very serious situation,&quot; McCain told NBC's Meet the Press on Aug. 24, 2003. Independent experts and many Democrats have lavished criticism on the administration's strategy in Iraq. But among his Republican competitors, McCain was clearly there first. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama proposed more troops in '07</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For at least a year now, I have called for two additional brigades, perhaps three.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, July 20 in Afghanistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a trip to Afghanistan, Obama said the United States needed to focus on the war there, calling the situation &quot;precarious and urgent,&quot; and saying, &quot;for at least a year now, I have called for two additional brigades, perhaps three.&quot; We consulted the record to see if Obama had urged more troops that long ago. Back on Aug. 1, 2007, Obama gave a major foreign policy speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C., talking about the need for the United States to turn its attention to Afghanistan. &quot;Our troops have fought valiantly there, but Iraq has deprived them of the support they need - and deserve,&quot; Obama said. &quot;As a result, parts of Afghanistan are falling into the hands of the Taliban, and a mix of terrorism, drugs and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country. As president, I would deploy at least two additional brigades to Afghanistan to reinforce our counterterrorism operations and support NATO's efforts against the Taliban.&quot; That speech was the first time we could find Obama specifically advocating for more brigades to Afghanistan. Technically speaking, the time from his speech on Aug. 1, 2007, to his more recent statement is 10 days short of a year. But it's pretty darn close. So we find his statement True.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A distortion of what Obama said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama &quot;suggested bombing Pakistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, Feb. 20 in a media availability in Columbus, Ohio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's an extreme charge because Pakistan has been a key ally to the United States. We find McCain's remark seriously distorts what Obama said. In an Aug. 1, 2007, speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C., Obama spoke about the problem of terrorists within Pakistan. He said he would continue to provide military aid to Pakistan as long as authorities work to close terrorist training camps and prevent the Taliban from using Pakistan as a staging area. Then he added: &quot;I understand that (Pakistan) President Musharraf has his own challenges. But let me make this clear. There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans. They are plotting to strike again. It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al-Qaida leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will.&quot; We recognize that McCain is questioning the wisdom of Obama telegraphing our military plans. But it is a serious distortion to say Obama supports &quot;bombing Pakistan.&quot; (Indeed, all Obama said was that he would &quot;act.&quot;) That's Pants-on-Fire wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Obama example is just too old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain &quot;has threatened extinction for North Korea and sung songs about bombing Iran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Sept. 26 in a debatee in in Oxford, Miss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, North Korea's leader, Kim Il Sung, was refusing to allow inspections of his nuclear program. McCain appeared on This Week with David Brinkley and was asked about the prospects of outright war. &quot;I think history shows us, especially in dealing with dictators, that a strong, resolute policy and position is what usually avoids what you're talking about,&quot; McCain said. &quot;You think they're bluffing?&quot; he was asked. &quot;I don't know, but I know what they understand and that is the threat of extinction,&quot; McCain replied. So, he said it. But it was once in 1994. Now, about McCain's singing songs about bombing Iran. This stems from an April 18, 2007, event at a VFW hall in Murrells Inlet, S.C. A man asked McCain, &quot;When do we send an airmail message to Tehran?&quot; The audience clapped. &quot;That old Beach Boys song, Bomb Iran,&quot; McCain said, apparently referencing the 1965 single Barbara Ann. Then McCain sang softly, &quot;Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb. Anyway...&quot; Video is available on YouTube. McCain said later it was a joke. So in the end, Obama is right that McCain said both things. But we're not going to give full weight to the 14-year-old tough-talking remarks. We rate Obama's statement Half True.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highlights of their positions and plans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHN MCCAIN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Supports a robust presence in Iraq and additional troops in Afghanistan. Opposes timelines for the withdrawal of troops.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest installment of the Research 2000 Florida Poll, a survey of 600 likely voters commissioned jointly by the Times-Union and South Florida Sun Sentinel, was released Thursday. It carries a four-point margin of error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most people said they are looking past attack advertisements from both parties, it appears Republican presidential candidate John McCain stands the most to lose in the contest for Florida's 27 electoral votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-one percent of respondents said GOP attacks of Democrat Barack Obama's relationship to Ayers, a Vietnam activist linked to a group that bombed buildings decades ago, made them less likely to vote for McCain. Another 67 percent said they were unaffected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five percent of respondents said they were less likely to vote for Obama because of the Democrats' attacks on McCain's link to Keating, a prominent figure in the savings-and-loan scandal that cost thousands of people their life savings in the 1980s. Another 89 percent said they were unaffected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm embarrassed by the fact that they even use it. I know so much of it is not true, so I don't give it any weight,&quot; Walker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the economy tanking and major foreign policy decisions afoot in Iraq and Pakistan, Walker represents the modern-day voter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are some elections where spin matters, but I don't think this is one of them,&quot; said Darrell M. West, a Brookings Institution analyst and author of the election advertising guide Air Wars. &quot;People are much more worried about their 401(k) than they are about Bill Ayers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's typical for voters to say they're unaffected, but a negative campaign ad can serve as a Pandora's box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it gets people's attention, it works,&quot; said Matthew Corrigan, political science chair at the University of North Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said both camps have had problems with follow-through this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One day it's an ad saying Obama's friends with a terrorist. Then the next day McCain's on the stoop saying, 'We just have some differences,'&quot; Corrigan said. &quot;I think people are tired of this stuff because there has been so much of it and the campaigns aren't backing up their attacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poll data were collected this week before Wednesday night's presidential debate. West said he doesn't think the debate led any major shifts in voter opinion nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll showed Obama leading McCain by 4 percentage points in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's led to a hard fight in a state that many analysts agree McCain must win to have a shot at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local GOP Chairman John Falconetti said every voter will determine what's relevant in a campaign. To some, that will be examining Obama's relationship with Ayers. He likened it to a character reference, but he stresses there's a difference between exposure and attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really not cut and dried,&quot; he said. &quot;The tone of negativity absolutely turns people off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MELBOURNE - John McCain acknowledged in an exclusive interview Friday that he'd probably be better positioned in must-win Florida if he had picked Charlie Crist as his running mate. The Republican presidential nominee expressed no regrets for choosing Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, and said Florida was sure to be a hard-fought state with almost any vice presidential pick - besides Crist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Charlie, because he's so popular he probably would have made a significant difference,'' McCain said in an interview with the St. Petersburg Times and Bay News 9 for a &quot;Political Connections&quot; show airing Sunday. &quot;I think this would have been a battleground state, except for obviously (with) a popular governor as Charlie Crist is,'' McCain said.&quot;Look, this is a tough decision that we made with Sarah Palin. But I also saw Sarah Palin come down here and energize crowds in a way that's pretty remarkable too.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has been hammering Barack Obama for his associations with the likes of 1960s radical Will Ayers and the controversial community organizing group ACORN. But he declined interview to talk about his own relationship with Harry Sargeant, a top McCain fundraiser from Palm Beach County accused by the Democratic chairman of the U.S. House oversight committee of &quot;war profiteering&quot; and vastly overbilling the Defense Department for fuel deliveries in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have no idea what those charges are. We had to give back, as you know, some of the contributions that he raised,''McCain said, referring to $50,000 in unusual campaign contributions to McCain bundled by Sargeant, which raised questions in August about whether they had been made by people in California later reimbursed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know anything about those charges so I can't make a comment on any of that,'' McCain said of the latest allegations, strongly denied by Sargeant. &quot;I don't know what they're talking about. But I'll get back to you if you like.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is extending Florida stay to Tuesday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, who will be in Tampa and Orlando on Monday, will appear Tuesday at an early voting rally in Miami with his wife Michelle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Marion County Republicans are trying to woo Gov. Sarah Palin back to Florida for an Oct. 27 rally. County GOP chairman Roy Abshier told the Buzz he has been talking with the McCain campaign about the rally, to be held at the Southeastern Livestock Pavilion in Ocala, but so far does not have a commitment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All together now, Dems: McCain bad for seniors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Barack Obama was warning a crowd in Virginia that Republican John McCain would slash funding or Medicare, the government health care plan for senior citizens, his campaign was running an ad with the same message in Florida and U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson was telling reporters the last thing America needs now are cuts in benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now is not the time to privatize Social Security, and it's certainly not the time to cut Medicare and Medicaid, which John has proposed,&quot; Nelson said in a conference call for the Obama campaign. &quot;And you've got a clear difference there between him and Barack on some very, very important issues to a lot of people in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, McCain indeed has supported adding private savings accounts to Social Security. But the Medicare claim is based on an analysis of the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, which showed McCain's plan would cut Medicare and Medicaid spending by $1.3-trillion over 10 years to pay for his health care plan. That includes $882-billion from Medicare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign is crying foul, saying McCain supports the same sorts of streamlining of Medicare as Obama, who proposes cutting about $15-billion by eliminating excess payments to HMOs.</SPAN></P>

This sign was absolutely not condoned by the Republican Party of Florida. We strongly condemn this hateful rhetoric, which is not representative of Florida Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mel mighty vulnerable, Crist a little</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More from that Hamilton Beattie poll below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;U.S. Senator Mel Martinez appears to be facing an uphill battle for re-election, with only 44 percent of voters saying they will vote to re-elect the Republican Senator and 40 percent supporting a generic Democratic candidate, with 16 percent undecided. Governor Charlie Crist maintains a stronger (but by no means safe) lead in a bid for re-election, receiving 52 percent of the vote over 34 percent for a generic Democratic candidate, with 14 percent undecided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The trend of close elections between well-funded candidates looks to continue in 2010, with real competition for the U.S. Senate seat and with a governor who is personally popular, but who barely receives a majority of the vote against an unnamed candidate,&quot; said pollster David Beattie. Beattie said he conducted the poll for public release rather than any client (he doesn't have a statewide client this year and wants to have Florida benchmarks to compare with past cycles), but remember his clients include Alex Sink and Bill Nelson.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poll: Obama up 4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poll taken by Democratic polling firm Hamilton Beattie from Oct. 10 through 15 of 700 likely voters (margin of error +/- 3.7 percent) has Barack Obama with 47 percent support and John McCain at 43 percent. Among those concerned about the economy McCain trails by 38 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has a more than 25 percentage point lead in the Miami media market, the region of the state where voters are the most concerned about economic uncertainty. Conversely, in the Panhandle and Northeast Florida, where voters show the lowest level of concern about the economy, John McCain holds a more than 11 percentage point lead in the race for president. Interestingly, in North Florida, 6 percent of voters choose a third party candidate, preventing John McCain from maximizing his support in this region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters concerned about the economy are lost to McCain and without increased support in the Panhandle, there's no way for McCain to win Florida. And without Florida, there is no realistic scenario for McCain to win the presidency,&quot; said pollster David Beattie.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party's independent ad operation is doubling its budget to about $10 million and focusing on crucial states where Democrat Barack Obama has established a foothold, including Colorado, Missouri, Indiana and Virginia, according to a Republican strategist familiar with presidential ad placements. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two wealthy Republicans are the financial fuel behind both sides of the ballot measure that would ban gay marriage in the Florida Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backing the measure is the patriarch who founded Amway Corp. On the other side is a little-known telecom multimillionaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald A. Burns, 45, of West Palm Beach, contributed 18 percent or $400,000 of the $2.2-million raised by Florida Red and Blue, the most prominent group fighting Amendment 2. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side, state records show billionaire Orlando Magic owner Richard DeVos, 82, of Grand Rapids, Mich., has given $100,000, or about 15 percent of the $676,700 raised by Florida4Marriage, the group that collected signatures to put Amendment 2 on the Nov. 4 ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither man returned calls seeking comment about his contributions. But their contributions come to light as the campaigns for and against the measure heat up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Sunday, Florida4Marriage has provided sample sermons for pastors across the state hoping they'll promote Amendment 2 on as part of &quot;Marriage Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Red and Blue has launched television commercials, while allies have taken to staging news conferences across the state and debuting Web-only videos, including one Wednesday featuring Michael Schiavo, the widower of Terri Schiavo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amendment 2 would define marriage in the state Constitution as between one man and one woman. Florida already has such a state law, but Amendment 2 backers say the law could be overturned, as it was in Connecticut last week, or the Legislature could change it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pro and anti forces disagree about whether Amendment 2 would make it more difficult for unmarried couples to share in domestic partner benefits, which would ultimately get decided by lawsuits and the court system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burns is a relatively new force on the state political scene. A Republican investor and philanthropist, he gave $500 contributions to Gov. Charlie Crist, Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Ken Pruitt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, he told Florida Red and Blue that he'd match contributions of up to $250,000. Then he contributed another $150,000. The group's campaign manager, Derek Newton, declined to talk about Burns, saying he respected his contributors' privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the federal campaign scene, Burns is a regular, if eclectic, donor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to Republicans, he's given to both Rudy Giuliani and Sen. John McCain. He's a past supporter of President George W. Bush, former U.S. Rep. Mark Foley and Sen. Mel Martinez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2004 presidential campaign, he contributed $1,000 to the Swift Boat group that attacked Democratic nominee Sen. John Kerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that same year, Burns gave $2,000 each to Democrat John Edwards and Ralph Nader. He's given $2,300 to Sen. Barack Obama. And back in 2005, he gave $5,000 to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, which funds openly gay political candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burns is a former chief executive of publicly traded Telco Communication Group, a discount long-distance service provider. It was sold in 1997 for $1.2-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the decade since then, he's launched the Donald A. Burns Foundation, a Palm Beach charitable foundation to &quot;promote educational and social institutions.&quot; Tax records show assets of $10.7-million in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools in Palm Beach County, Massachusetts and Mississippi have received grants from the foundation for things like computer labs, inner-city tennis programs and instructional materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burns also owns the New York building where actor Heath Ledger died this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DeVos family, on the other hand, is a familiar name in Florida politics and beyond. It owns the Orlando Magic basketball team. Richard DeVos Jr., the 52-year-old son, ran an unsuccessful campaign for Michigan governor in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DeVos family has contributed millions toward conservative causes nationwide, including school voucher, antiabortion and anti-gay marriage efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past 12 years in Florida, both DeVos Sr. and his son have given $700,000 to Florida Republicans, including more than $500,000 to the Republican Party of Florida in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, when Michigan considered and ultimately passed its own gay marriage ban, the DeVos family spent $125,000, according to the Grand Rapids Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, DeVos' contribution to the Florida's gay-marriage ban prompted a protest of 30 people outside of Amway Arena, where the Magic play, on Sept. 28, the Orlando Sentinel reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orlando City Commissioner Patty Sheehan, who is gay, called for an investigation on whether DeVos' support of Amendment 2 violates the city's ordinance banning discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Stemberger, leader of Florida4Marriage, declined to talk about DeVos except to say: &quot;We appreciate all of the support the Yes2Marriage Campaign has received from our volunteers, grass root workers and contributors both big and small like Mr. DeVos.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer on Friday will demand Gov. Charlie Crist strip the certification from a Panhandle teacher who was allowed to keep his job Thursday night despite using a racial slur in class about Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jackson County School Board voted 3-2 to uphold suspending Greg Howard for two weeks and transfer him to an adult education school, but rejected angry cries for his termination. The penalty, which also included Howard losing his football coaching job, had previously been recommended by school superintendent Danny Sims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is unbelievable,&quot; said Tallahassee lawyer Ben Crump, who was at the meeting. &quot;Everybody knows this is racism.&quot; Crump said the room nearly boiled over with the decision. &quot;It was very heated, very, very heated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sept. 26, Howard, 43, wrote the word CHANGE -- the mantra of Obama's presidential campaign -- on a dry-erase board at Marianna Middle School then, according to reports, added his own definition: Come Help A (N-word) Get Elected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump, the lawyer who worked on the Martin Lee Anderson boot camp death in Panama City, wrote a letter Thursday, urging the school board to fire the teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[H]oward's actions were grossly immoral and a serious and flagrant offense, causing embarrassment and disparagement to the black children in his classroom, and causing the impressionable black and white children to believe that using the racial epitaph is acceptable. As a deterrent, Howard should be terminated,&quot; it read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a divided school board sided with the superintendent's recommendation. Terry Nichols, Betty Duffee and Chris Johnson voted for the recommendation; Charlotte Gardner and Kenny Griffin voted against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reached by phone after the meeting, Gardner refused to discuss her feelings. &quot;The vote is over,&quot; she said, &quot;therefore I will support the decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that the superintendent would not agree to a harder judgment. &quot;It looks bad for us and it's not bad,&quot; Gardner said. &quot;We're a wonderful place to educate our youth. It's a great place to live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erin Isaac, a Crist spokeswoman, said Thursday night that her office had still not had time to review the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman who answered the phone at Howard's home flatly said, &quot;We have no comment.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA - If you wonder why John McCain may be in trouble in Florida, take a look in our back yard. The state's most critical battleground is the Tampa Bay area, a swing-voter mecca where Barack Obama has relentlessly focused attention and where recent polls consistently show McCain lagging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Republicans are confident about their grass roots campaign in this region, home to a quarter of the Florida electorate, but warning signs abound: ***Obama is drowning out McCain on local airwaves. According to the latest analysis by the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project, Obama aired 1,069 TV ads in the bay area from Sept. 28 to Oct. 4, while McCain aired just 369. ***In Hillsborough County, which President Bush carried by 5 percentage points in 2004, Obama is leading by six points in a Politico/InsiderAdvantage poll released this week. ***In Sarasota County, the longtime GOP stronghold that Bush won by 13 points four years ago, at least three recent Republican polls showed McCain tied or slightly behind Obama.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sargeant faces 'war profiteering' charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry Sargeant, the Florida businessman who has been a major fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain and Gov. Charlie Crist, faces allegations in Congress that he overcharged U.S. taxpayers to ship jet fuel to Iraq. A letter sent Thursday by U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., to Defense Secretary Robert Gates says that based on a recent briefing by Pentagon officials and documents, &quot;Mr. Sargeant's company appears to have engaged in a reprehensible form of war profiteering.&quot; He asked Gates to conduct a thorough investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sargeant issued a statement calling Waxman's allegations &quot;deeply disappointing&quot; and saying he wished its authors &quot;had sought all of the facts.&quot; He cited a &quot;complex, risky and, at times, life-threatening&quot; challenge to keep fuel flowing to U.S. troops in Iraq, and noted that the Defense Department has awarded certificates of achievement to his firm. &quot;The conclusions in Chairman Waxman's letter aren't supported by the facts,&quot; Sargeant said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The congressman -- a liberal Democrat and long-time critic of the war in Iraq -- says that since receiving the contract in 2004, Sargeant's firm has earned a profit of more than $210-million, $70-million of which went to Sargeant. The letter says a Pentagon office that oversaw the contract found Sargeant's reduced price of $2.10 a gallon was 36 cents a gallon higher than it should be and that he twice rebuffed government requests to lower his prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waxman's letter noted that Sargeant's company, International Oil Trading Company (IOTC), was one of six bidders on an Iraq fuel contract. It submitted the highest bid, but was the only firm that met a requirement to have a &quot;letter of authorization&quot; from the Jordanian government to transport fuel across that country. Sargeant did that by forming a partnership with two Jordanian businessmen, one of whom is the brother-in-law of Jordan's King Abdullah II. &quot;Mr. Sargeant and IOTC appear to have taken full advantage of their ties to the Jordanian Royal Family,&quot; Waxman wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sargeant (at center) introduced the king to Crist when the governor toured Israel and Jordan in 2007. The South Florida businessman was a fraternity brother of Crist's when they atteended Florida State. Sargeant also was a fund-raising &quot;bundler&quot; for McCain's campaign, which returned about $50,000 in contributions linked to Sargeant's efforts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High praise for Crist for switching to paper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 50-state report by national election watchdogs rates Florida in the vast middle in election preparedness. The report by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU, Common Cause and Verified Voting Foundation focused on emergency procedures for faulty touch screens, availability of paper records, and how states tally and audit election results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups do not like Florida's voter verification law, which requires an exact match of numbers on post-Sept. 8 voter registration forms and driver license or Social Security number. Common Cause estimates that 10,000 to 15,000 new voters in Florida could be affected and would have to cast provisional ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the group praised Gov. Charlie Crist for leading the switch from paperless electronic machines to paper ballots cast on optical scan units. &quot;It's an enormous, tremendous improvement, and we extend appropriate commendations,&quot; said Susannah Goodman, head of election reform at Common Cause. (The only reason the state didn't get higher marks from the report is that it continues to use touch screens until 2012 for voters with disabilities, and those units don't include a paper trail.) Read the report here (http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/is_america_ready_to_vote).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Say it ain't so, Sarah. She's a Sox fan now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about those Tampa Bay Rays?&quot; Gov. Sarah Palin shouted in Jacksonville last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what that tells me, it tells me that the people in this area know a little something about turning an underdog into a victor,&quot; she said. &quot;And we're counting on you to help us do that Nov. 4.&quot; Palin, who said essentially the same thing in Clearwater (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7jusa7fYJI), might as well have pulled on a Rays jersey and sprayed the crowd with champagne and beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But yesterday in Salem, N.H., John McCain's running mate was saying something remarkably similar about the other guys. &ntilde;We're just 20 days out from the election and it's gonna come right down to the wire, and we're counting on you because Red Sox fans know how to turn an underdog into a victor, and that's exactly what you can help us do on Nov. 4!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we're not really sure who Palin will be rooting for in tonight's ALCS Game 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats quickly pointed out the dual loyalty. &quot;Apparently this team of mavericks thinks straight talk means saying one thing to Rays fans and another to Red Sox fans,&quot; said DNC spokesman Damien LaVera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can't wait to see what Barack Obama will do. With the Rays blasting by the Chicago White Sox, Obama has thrown his allegiance (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUf3K-xaeUg) to the Philadelphia Phillies. A likely World Series match-up: Rays vs. Phillies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just in case, a bleaker-than-ever budget</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As state government agencies cope with mandatory 4 percent holdbacks, they are drawing up plans for 10 percent cuts next year if the economy keeps tanking. Gov. Charlie Crist, who will submit his next budget to the Legislature in January, ordered the recommendations as a contingency plan, aides say. But Florida faces a $900-million shortfall in the current year and a projected shortfall of $3.5-billion next year and a new and likely gloomy revenue forecast will be issued on Nov. 21, right after the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could it happen? The Crist contingency plan presents a picture of fewer state troopers on state highways, longer lines at driver license offices, and closings of juvenile detention centers and crime labs. Nearly 500 probation officer jobs would be wiped out in the Department of Corrections. Back on the chopping block, as usual, is the elimination of dentures, eyeglasses and hearing aids for poor people on Medicaid. Here's a timely cost-cutting idea: Some money Florida spends to combat voter fraud would be cut -- and that could result in the loss of $66-million in federal funds under the Help America Vote Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Crist's office claims it could not take a 10 percent cut: &quot;The Executive Office could not sustain a reduction of this magnitude,&quot; the report says. Check out the agencies' proposals here (http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us/Agencies.aspx?FY=2009&amp;EXID=8).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you aim to make the perfect pie, you've got time. National Pie Day isn't until Friday, Jan. 23, and by then one of our current presidential candidates will be enjoying his favorite pie in the Oval Office. Barack Obama favors pumpkin pie, while Cindy McCain makes a Twinkie pie that is her family's favorite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, if you need pies in a hurry for the upcoming Thanksgiving and December holidays, you will either need a crash course in the basics, or the phone numbers of celebrated local pie makers who are definitely the upper crust of cuisine society this time of year. Debbie Geiger, known professionally as Debbie Appleseed, is one such pie maker. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Appleseed signature pie is Dutch apple, made with a secret-recipe crumble topping and fresh apples that Geiger slices by hand. Geiger, who grew up on a Mennonite-Amish farm in Indiana, has been baking since the age of 5, when she started helping her mother, a custom cake maker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I could bake and decorate a cake at an early age,&quot; she recalls, &quot;but I much preferred cooking for my three brothers, because they'd eat any and everything I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">made. My specialty was something I thought was Southwestern with eggs covered with a kidney-bean salsa. And they loved my stuffed potatoes.&quot; When Geiger was 19, she brought a homemade peach pie to a friend's party and got both raves and encouragement for her obvious talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I still wasn't interested in making pies,&quot; she says. &quot;I'm a singer and composer, and I moved to Bradenton a few years ago in hopes that a music deal with a producer would work out. But it didn't, and I took a job with an alarm company. I brought my Dutch apple pie to an employee potluck event, and within a couple of months the the company was buying my pies. Pretty soon, I was earning more money with the pies than from the job I was hired for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last April, Geiger moved to Sarasota (her relatives come down seasonally, and she wanted to be closer to them) and began to consider the life of a committed pie maker, selling to both restaurants and private clients. So she came up with the Debbie Appleseed name, rented commercial kitchen space and devised a work schedule that allows her to keep her Comcast Cable night job. The pie maker usually delivers her flaky masterpieces to clients, but during the busy Thanksgiving season customers will have to claim their custom pies at her kitchen door, because she will be too busy to abandon her ovens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geiger is fiercely loyal to a certain brand of flour (she won't tell) and she uses solid shortening instead of lard because she wants all her pies to be vegetarian-friendly. For the near future, Geiger plans to keep her night job, saving money so that she can realize her dream of owning her own gourmet coffee house/gift-basket emporium. Of course, she will serve pie by the slice, as well as whole pies to go. Geiger has a Web site and plans soon to introduce a signature collection of 10 jellies that she makes from flowers. Geiger has been experimenting with homemade jellies and jams since the age of 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the holiday season, the most popular Debbie Appleseed-brand pie is Dutch apple, followed by pumpkin and then pecan. But, she offers many pie varieties with prices that range from $15 to $20 for a nine-inch pie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Debbie Geiger is Debbie Appleseed alone in her kitchen baking pies, she puts on background music and sings her own musical compositions while she sifts, peels and rolls out dough. &quot;I yodel, too,&quot; she reveals, &quot;and I come by that naturally since I'm Swiss-Austrian, and my dad was born in Austria.&quot; This single mom of a 15-year-old son taught her child proficiency in the kitchen. Does son, Matthew, have a future in the business? &quot;I don't think so,&quot; says his mother. &quot;Matthew can bake a pie; he'll help me when I need it, but he'd rather cook than bake, and his favorite dessert is a brownie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEBBIE APPLESEED PIE TIPS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Use unbleached flour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Opt for solid shortening instead of lard so that your pie will be vegetarian-friendly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Once you add the water to the dry ingredients to make the dough, handle the dough as little as possible. Roll it out quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The first piece of pie is the hardest to cut, and looks the worst on the plate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Practice; you will get better as you go.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scoring the third debate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Astute Buzz readers will have noticed that Barack Obama just invoked a turning point in the presidential campaign: The morning in Jacksonville last month when Sen. John McCain, then leading in some Sunshine State polls, declared the &quot;fundamentals of the economy are strong(http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/article812349.ece).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fundamentals of the economy were weak,&quot; Obama said tonight. But the contest is young.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is Times political editor Adam C. Smith's story(http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/article857060.ece) on the debate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Posted by Alex Leary at 9:17:20 PM on October 15, 2008</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Austin doesn't want Obama killed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beware forwarding those mass e-mails on political candidates. Al Austin, the Tampa developer and mega GOP fundraiser, today blast e-mailed a less-than-charming joke about Barack Obama talking to an elementary school class about the meaning of the word &quot;tragedy.&quot; The punchline:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally at the back of the room, Little Johnny raised his hand. In a quiet voice he said: 'If the plane carrying you and Mrs. Obama was struck by a 'friendly fire' missile and blown to smithereens that would be a tragedy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Fantastic!' exclaimed Obama. 'That's right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Well,' says the boy, 'It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn't be a great loss.. and it probably wouldn't be an accident either .'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Tampa Trib called him about it, Austin promptly sent out another e-mail: &quot;I sent it without reading it and the last lines referring to Senator Obama and his wife are not something that I approve of and is entirely wrong and certainly does not represent my feelings. This was sent in error and I request that none of you forward this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sounding mortified, Austin called us to say he asked an assistant to send along the email, that he hadn't read it, and that he would cease with such blast e-mails.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida riper for Obama than Ohio?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Florida the new Ohio, in the way Ohio four years ago was the new Florida? Back in early June, when many politicos were doubting Barack Obama's potential to win Florida, Democratic pollster Dave Beattie was a lone voice: Obama has a better shot at winning Florida, said Beattie, than he does Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida has a bigger African-American population, he told us then(http://tampabay.com/news/politics/national/article622018.ece), and as more of a growth state offers far more educated suburban voters who often don't vote. &quot;There's a type of voter in Florida that doesn't always vote, that lives around Tampa, St. Pete, around Orlando and Palm Beach County and Jacksonville, and those are the types of voters that are very open to Obama,'' said Beattie, whose clients include Sen. Bill Nelson and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beattie was prescient. Obama's lead in Florida today is slightly better than in Ohio.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe Jesse Jackson really is trying to cut off(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aLGkFpsdHo) Barack Obama's n_ts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson handed Republicans their latest attack by saying that Israel's influence will wane if Obama is elected. Although &quot;Zionists who have controlled American policy for decades&quot; will remain strong, they'll lose a great deal of their clout, Jackson told the New York Post(http://www.nypost.com/seven/10142008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/the_o_jesse_knows_133450.htm?page=0).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is one more example of why Jewish voters in larger numbers than ever are going to be voting for Sen. McCain on Election Day,&quot; State Rep. Adam Hasner, R-Delray Beach, said in a conference call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fort Lauderdale Rep. Ellyn Bogdanoff said that when a candidate does not have a track record on Israel, &quot;and Sen. Obama does not, you have to ultimately judge how they are going to behave by the people that they are surrounded by and the comments that are made by their key supporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a stretch to call Jackson a key supporter, and Obama's campaign points to plenty of support for Israel. But the Democrat has clearly been damaged among some Jewish voters in Florida. It's what caused comedian Sarah Silverman's to launch the &quot;Great Schlep(http://www.thegreatschlep.com/site/index.html).&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - Hours after a married congressman addressed a report that he had an affair with a former aide and paid her to keep quiet about it, details of a purported tryst with a second woman surfaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Mahoney did not directly mention allegations first reported by ABC News that he had been involved with the former aide, he issued a statement apologizing to his family but denying he'd done anything illegal. Later Tuesday, a person close to his campaign told the Associated Press that Mahoney also was having an affair with a second woman around the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday night, a person close to the Mahoney campaign told the AP that Mahoney also was having a relationship with a high-ranking official in Martin County in his Florida district around the same time of the purported affair with the former aid.The person close to the campaign spoke only on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to openly discuss Mahoney's private life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The person said Mahoney was having the relationship with the official in 2007 while he also was lobbying the Federal Emergency Management Agency for a $3.4 million reimbursement for Martin County for damage caused by hurricanes in 2004. FEMA approved the money late last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accelerating whose horizons, Charlie?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Charlie Crist said Wednesday that 179 road and bridge projects will be &quot;accelerated&quot; on the DOT work program, each from one to five months, as a way of injecting a little life into Florida's stagnant economy. The state says the projects total $1.4-billion and will employ 39,000 people. &quot;Floridians need our help,&quot; Crist said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist unveiled the &quot;Accelerate Florida&quot; program in August, but Wednesday was the first time DOT was able to identify specific projects that are being sped up. They include the State Road 39 bridge over the Hillsborough River, widening I-75 between Naples and Fort Myers, adding capacity to State Road 50 in Orlando and replacing the Max Brewer Bridge in Brevard County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full name of the program is &quot;Accelerate Florida: Extending Florida's Economic Horizons.&quot; Crist and DOT Secretary Stephanie Kopelousos stood in front of a backdrop featuring the program's logo, and some of the participants wore &quot;Accelerate Florida&quot; lapel stickers, which to The Buzz looked clearly like the onset of Crist's 2010 re-election campaign. &quot;You can see whatever you want. I don't. I don't,&quot; Crist said. &quot;The news is that Florida's moving forward, and we're moving forward more quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 179 projects, just 12 are in the Tampa Bay region, including: &quot;Resurfacing of 4.5 miles of Fifth Avenue N. (Alt. U.S. 19) from Fourth St. to 58th St. in St. Petersburg and sidewalk repairs.&quot; Kopelousos said the &quot;acceleration&quot; comes from speeding up the permitting process by 30 days or more.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist not buying GOP's ACORN-ophobia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite claims by the Republican National Committee that the integrity of Florida's voting system is at risk thanks to the registration efforts of ACORN, a liberal leaning group that backs Sen. Barack Obama, Republican Gov. Charlie Crist said he's not buying it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are some who sort of enjoy chaos,&quot; Crist told reporters this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist said he has &quot;enormous confidence&quot; in his secretary of state, Republican Kurt Browning, who reports there is no widespread voter fraud in Florida. A handful of bogus registrations, including one for Mickey Mouse, have been submitted by ACORN in Central Florida, but they've been caught by elections officials or the organization itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conference call, the second in two days, RNC spokesman Danny Diaz and chief counsel Sean Cairncross warned that ACORN and, by extension, the Democratic presidential nominee were corrupting the system. They were unable to offer new specifics, but that based on the &quot;sheer volume of reports,&quot; Diaz said, &quot;it's hard to argue that there's not a national systemic problem... At least three counties have issues in Florida and I'm certain there are probably more.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeb Bush and Tom Feeney, reunited</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Tom Feeney, battling to keep his seat in Congress in a difficult year for Republicans, will get a financial boost from an old friend, Jeb Bush. With Feeney in the political fight of his life against Democrat Suzanne Kosmas, the former governor will headline a Feeney fundraiser at the Coral Gables home of Phillis Oeters at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first time Bush ran for governor in 1994, he chose Feeney as his running mate, and together they went down to defeat, narrowly. Democrats portrayed Feeney as an extremist who wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare, which inspired those &quot;scare calls&quot; to elderly voters by the Lawton Chiles campaign. As the newly-minted speaker of the Florida House in 2000, Feeney led the charge to have the Legislature seat George W. Bush as president while the election chaos was playing out in the courts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP frets about McCain in Fla</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are increasingly worried about John McCain's prospects in must-win Florida. The McCain campaign spent most of the summer watching Barack Obama build a massive voter mobilization operation and flood Florida's TV airwaves with ads. For months, they scoffed at how little it did to boost Obama, but now the Democrat has opened up a steady lead in Florida polls and top Republicans are sounding uncharacteristically anxious that the campaign and state party are doing too little, too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama obviously has spent a ton of dough, and the fact that we haven't spent a fraction of that has got people concerned. They see all these ads and very little response,'' said former Republican National Committee finance chairman Al Hoffman, a top McCain fundraiser in Florida. &quot;We're three weeks away and have a lot of work to do. We can play Monday morning quarterback after the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Gov. Charlie Crist is fending off suggestions that he's distancing himself from the McCain-Palin ticket, while state GOP chairman Jim Greer made the unusual announcement Tuesday that he would be traveling the state to &quot;assess campaign operations&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with the financial markets collapsing around the world in recent weeks, a little-known group called the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, is suddenly at the heart of Republican presidential nominee John McCain's attacks on Democratic rival Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But who -- or what -- is ACORN? Outside of political circles, the group is unlikely to be recognized. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And why is the entire Republican Party, not just the McCain campaign, up in arms about the group? ACORN has been advocating for issues related to economic and social equity since its founding in 1970, but its voter registration drive this particular presidential season has the GOP crying foul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conference call with reporters on Friday, McCain campaign manager Rick Davis noted that Obama had conducted voter registration training sessions for ACORN early in his career as a community organizer in Chicago. He questioned whether Obama had provided instructions on &quot;how to evade the law&quot; at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't think the election is something that should be stolen,&quot; Davis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis' call came just days after Nevada authorities raided an ACORN office in Las Vegas amid allegations that workers had submitted fraudulent voter registration forms, including applications purportedly from two Dallas Cowboys players -- quarterback Tony Romo and wide receiver Terrell Owens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also coincided with:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A new McCain Internet ad charging that ACORN, working with the Obama campaign, is responsible not only for &quot;nationwide voter fraud&quot; but for playing a role in the current financial crisis by &quot;pressuring banks to issue risky loans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A trip to Florida by House Republican Leader John Boehner on behalf of GOP congressional candidates, in which the Ohioan charged that ACORN is &quot;committed to undermining our electoral system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A Fox News interview in which Rep. Tom Feeney, R-Oviedo, who is facing a difficult reelection campaign, charged that ACORN had &quot;violated more Americans' civil rights to have their vote counted than any group since the KKK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign dismissed the allegations. Spokesman Tommy Vietor said in a statement: &quot;Barack Obama strongly condemns voter registration fraud or any other breach of election law by any party or group. The McCain campaign's allegations about Sen. Obama are completely transparent and false.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACORN reacted to the McCain&nbsp;ad with a statement from its president, Maud Herd: &quot;John McCain and the Republicans are desperately trying to shift the blame for the economic crisis they caused with a philosophy of deregulation and indifference to homeowners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, in response to the raid in Las Vegas, ACORN chief organizer Bertha Lewis said her organization had alerted state officials to the potentially fraudulent registration forms produced by contract employees. She said the raid was &quot;a stunt that serves no purpose other than to discredit our work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACORN's registration drive this fall has added 1.3 million voters to the rolls in 18 states, notably the swing states of Ohio (247,335) and Florida (151,812, mostly in Orange, Broward and Miami-Dade counties).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACORN claims to be nonpartisan, but its political agenda tilts Democratic on such issues as comprehensive health care, education reforms and Gulf Coast recovery. Its political action committee, a separate but allied entity, endorsed Obama during the Democratic primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has paid $800,000 to an ACORN subsidiary, Citizens Services Inc., to help with voter registration efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's&nbsp;ad claims that &quot;at least&quot; 11 investigations of ACORN are under way, although only three have been verified: the Nevada probe and pending requests for investigations of ACORN activities in Chicago's Indiana suburbs and in Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political experts, meanwhile, are puzzled that ACORN has come under attack by Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I suspect some GOP strategists think this is a way to reinforce their charge that Obama is linked to corrupt and unsavory organizations and individuals through his organizing days in Chicago,&quot; said Thomas Mann, a senior political analyst at the Brookings Institution. &quot;It is ... unlikely to have any effect on the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This editorial's admonition regarding the threat to freshwater turtles is exaggerated. Less than 10 percent of the freshwater turtles exported from Florida come from the wild; the rest come from farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your editorial states that Florida hasn't restricted the harvest of freshwater turtles. That simply is not true. We have had restrictions in place and now they have been strengthened. On Oct. 23, an additional restriction passed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) will go into effect, further restricting the harvest of wild freshwater turtles in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Softshell turtles cannot be taken from May 1 through July 31, and river cooters cannot be taken from April 15 through July 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FWC instituted the further restriction of freshwater turtle harvest after meetings with commercial fishermen and turtle experts. Under the new rule, freshwater turtle harvest is restricted to five per day per person. Licensed commercial fishermen may take an additional 15 Florida softshell turtles per day during the nine-month open season. Previously, they could harvest unlimited amounts during the open season. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turtle harvest received no attention until six months ago, and now that it has been identified as an issue, the FWC has taken rapid action to prevent escalation of harvest. We have given ourselves one year to better understand the harvest, the impacts to turtle populations and the local economic impacts that will occur with additional regulations. This course is prudent and objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To overnight put Floridians out of business who have been legitimately harvesting turtles for generations, particularly when there is no scientific data to substantiate that this is an emergency, is not how the FWC operates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will protect the turtles and be driven by science, not by the emotions of the moment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am so tired of the mudslinging between the two presidential candidates, I could spit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are both men of character. They have both served their country, each in his own way. One in the military, enduring five years in a Vietnamese prison camp, the other working in the notoriously poor neighborhoods of Chicago's South Side. Both have put aside careers that would have made them a lot of money to serve in the Senate. So why are they allowing their campaigns to continue character attacks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Come on, gentlemen. You each have a plan, a platform and a vision of the future to present to the voters. Let's get to it. In the next debate, try answering the questions directly and stop the stump speeches. And please stop calling each other names! You are distracting us, and there are a good number of undecided voters who are giving you the next three weeks to clean up your act and get to the point.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP is packing anger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has it really come to this? Are people in this country so polarized that Internet rumors and right-wing radio innuendo have people convinced Barack Obama is a terrorist, Arab, traitor? I'm sorry John McCain had to quell a chorus of boos in Minnesotta, and had to actually defend Obama, but this is his party and all that comes with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is a great American who has finally gotten a chance to run for president of the United States. It's too bad his party has been set on courses so different from his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If McCain wins, he will undoubtedly have a huge undertaking trying to be who he really is: a reformer, centrist, and one willing to reach across the aisle to make things work. His party will not allow it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain integrity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have long admired Sen. John McCain for both his service to our country and his integrity. I am not of his party, nor have I always agreed with his policies. I admire his consistent dedication to his beliefs, his desire to do what he believes is best for the nation, and his personal integrity, which seems to require him to tell the truth and make hard decisions even when there are political consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the midst of such a contentious election, I admit that my admiration for him has been tarnished as the fight with Barack Obama has often been harsh and heated. However, as I watched the footage of a town hall meeting in La Crosse, Wis., I again saw the man I have admired. Despite the negative response from the audience and the potential to alienate voters who are operating under false and often racist assumptions, he spoke the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I appreciate the risk he took to do this, to stand up for what is right. He showed us who the real John McCain is: a man of integrity, someone to be admired.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential ground game in Florida is shifting more to early voting sites, which open Oct. 20. But we should keep our eye on absentee ballots. To date, Democrats have requested 573,388, independents 254,789, and Republicans 792,942. Put another way, of the more than 1.6-million absentee ballots requested, nearly half have gone to Republicans, about 35 percent to Democrats, and nearly 16 percent to independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bad sign for Democrats? Not entirely. At this point in 2006, Democrats say, more than 56 percent of absentee ballots had gone to Republicans, 28 percent to Democrats, and 15 percent to independents. So what two years ago was a 28 percent GOP advantage on absentee ballots has been cut in half this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's 'voter protection' effort in Florida</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's Florida campaign brought Michelle Obama to the phone Tuesday to call attention to its voter protection effort, with a toll-free number to help voters (1-877-2FLOBAMA) and a list of all Florida early voting sites on the campaign site, www.voteforchange.com(http://www.voteforchange.com/_. &quot;We need to reverse the trend of past elections when millions of Americans stayed home on Election Day and they miss their chance at shaping history,&quot; Mrs. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama Florida director Steve Schale and Boston lawyer David Sullivan, head of the voter protection program in Florida, said the push to steer people to the campaign for voting help should not be seen as a lack of confidence in Florida election supervisors. In fact, Sullivan said the Obama campaign has lots of confidence in the recently-restructured Palm Beach County elections operation, headed by a deputy county administrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party of Florida has praised the Obama campaign for its effort, but urged the Democrat to do more, such as condemning the use of the &quot;no match, no vote&quot; term as &quot;a scare tactic by left-wing advocacy groups.&quot; RPOF spokeswoman Erin VanSickle said: &quot;This law is about verifying identity, not prohibiting someone from voting.&quot; (The GOP voter-assistance site is www.rpof.org/voter-action-center.php(http://www.rpof.org/voter-action-center.php).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary of State Kurt Browning has criticized the aggressive lawyering by both presidential campaigns in Florida, and has predicted it will lead to lawsuits. &quot;Both parties (are) flying in, busing in, trucking in attorneys,&quot; Browning said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our lawyers are not about filing lawsuits,&quot; Sullivan said. &quot;We care about protecting the right to vote.&quot; He said the campaign will be watching closely when the polls open at early voting sites Monday for long lines, and he again debunked a couple of persistent (and false) rumors: that campaign paraphernalia is prohibited at the polls and that a voter's driver license address, if presented at the polls, must match the voter's voting address in the precinct register. (A license is used for identification, nothing else).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign officials in Hillsborough County sent out this solicitation Saturday offering $12 an hour to anyone willing to walk door-to-door. &quot;Walk as many shifts per week as you want,&quot; the ad says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buzz is sitting through a riveting Catastrophe Fund Advisory Board meeting, where a packed room of insurers, government staffers and lobbyists are listening to a briefing of what the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe fund can and can't do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long story short: The state hurricane catastrophe fund has access to more money than it's ever had before. But it's also on the hook for more than it ever has been before. So if there's a major, big-time hurricane between now and the end of the year, the state fund couldn't reimburse insurers right away for claims, because it can't bond large amounts. But if the weather holds up and there are no hurricanes, we do this dance again next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's Buzz's translation of Raymond James catastrophe fund adviser John Forney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's his explanation: &quot;The CAT fund does have the most liquid resources available to it than it's ever had. That said, because of the expanded size of the CAT fund and the dire state of the credit market, the CAT fund couldn't do what it needed to do to meet its contractual obligation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cap is back</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A coalition of small-government advocates today launched an effort to place a constitutional cap on local government growth on the 2010 ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cap would limit growth to inflation plus population, or about 5 percent to 6 percent per year. Cities and counties could break the limit, but only after getting voter approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Called &quot;Your dollar, Your decision,&quot;( http://www.nfib.com/object/YourDollarYourDecision) the effort is similar to a cap attempted earlier this year by the Taxation and Budget Reform Commission. But that quickly became bogged down in philosophical differences and logistical problems. &quot;It's difficult to get politicians to restrain politicians,&quot; said Adam Guillette, director of Americans for Prosperity Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Legislature has already placed a cap on local government, but many cities and counties (40 percent, according to the coalition) voted to exceed that or raised fees to make up the shortfall. The proposal attempts to prevent that by placing that authority with voters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Tim Mahoney, D-Palm Beach Gardens, issued an apology this morning in the light of an ABC News report that he paid off a mistress. His statement is a nuanced, yet still potentially devastating, disclosure with three weeks before the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would have come forward earlier but making sure my family is okay is far more important than any political career,&quot; Mahoney said. &quot;I have not violated my oath of office, nor have I violated any laws, and I consider this to be a private matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I take full responsibility for my actions and the pain I have caused my wife, Terry, and my daughter Bailey. No marriage is perfect, but our private life is our private life, and I am sorry that these allegations have caused embarrassment and heartache.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have requested that the House Ethics Committee investigate the false allegations that have been repeated in the press. I want to be clear that I have not misused campaign funds, and I'm confident that when all the facts come to light, I will be cleared of any wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the people of my District know that I am a fighter, and I am not going to allow this story coming out 20 days before an election to change my resolve to serve the people of the 16th Congressional District. I have worked hard, and I am prepared to put my faith in the people and ask for their vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears about felons voting in Florida</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary of State Kurt Browning on Tuesday sought to dispel fears of election problems in a lengthy talk to Gov. Charlie Crist and Cabinet members. &quot;We are not taking anything for granted. Florida is ready,&quot; Browning said. He issued firm assurances that everyone who registered to vote by last week's deadline and whose identities can be verified will be able to vote without having to cast provisional ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But two Republicans, Attorney General Bill McCollum and Agriculture Commissioner Charlie Bronson, raised concerns about &quot;voter fraud&quot; by groups such as ACORN(http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/article852295.ece), and they seemed unconvinced by Browning's insistence that Florida has &quot;not seen the widespread fraud that Ohio has seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People think it's more widespread,&quot; McCollum told Browning, who replied that such perceptions underscore the need for the voter verification or &quot;no match&quot; law that has been vilified by some advocacy groups as too restrictive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prompted by McCollum, Browning addressed a Sunday report in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that up to 30,000 people with felony convictions are registered even though their civil rights have not been restored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browning said his office is conducting its own investigation and has identified 108,000 people whose names made a &quot;hit&quot; against a statewide criminal database. The checking continues, but Browning replied &quot;No&quot; when he was asked if all 108,000 names can be checked before Nov. 4. He reminded state officials of their own emphasis on making it easier for ex-felons to get their rights restored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, a Democrat, voiced fears of &quot;yet another fiasco&quot; in Florida -- the exact perception Browning has spent nearly two years trying to erase. Sink pointedly criticized Pinellas Supervisor of Elections Deborah Clark for having only three early voting sites in a county with a high proportion of elderly voters. &quot;We're just really afraid that there will be enormously long lines,&quot; Sink said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browning defended Clark, saying she has put a high emphasis on absentee voting and has 14 secure ballot drop-off sites throughout Pinellas. Florida is anticipating a turnout of 80 to 85 percent or nearly 9-million voters -- twice the number that voted in the last statewide election in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browning decried the pattern by both major presidential campaigns to flood Florida with thousands of lawyers who will work to make sure no voters are impeded from voting and to monitor the opposition for irregularities. That practice of &quot;flying in, busing in, trucking in attorneys,&quot; Browning said, will become a self-fulfilling prophecy of &quot;problems&quot; at the polls.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Charlie Crist today dismissed any notion that he is distancing himself from John McCain's campaign at a time when Barack Obama has surged ahead in many polls, including in Florida. The governor called the third and final debate critical, and he said it is wrong to again discount McCain's chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Written off last year as having no chance of being the GOP nominee, &quot;He certainly did come back, and he's a strong closer,&quot; Crist said of McCain. &quot;Twenty-one days is a lot of time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist scoffed at an MSNBC report that he's giving the McCain campaign the cold shoulder, noting he will campaign with McCain on Friday in Miami and Melbourne. &quot;I'm trying to do everything I can to help my friend and will continue to do so,&quot; the governor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the debate is crucial. &quot;I think he just needs to connect with the American people and speak from his heart and reassure people about the great strength of his leadership,&quot; Crist said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am a soldier in Iraq. I have walked the streets of many a village and seen oppression with my own eyes. I am actively engaged in building self-worth into a country that has been enslaved for decades. I am one of many teaching the citizens of Iraq what it means to be free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it is with Zachary Sharples and his &quot;Rayhawk&quot; haircut (&quot;His Rayhawk Strikes Out&quot; Local News, Oct. 9). He is practicing his First Amendment right of free expression and joining his community in support of their baseball team. The Manatee County School District is taking away this right, as well as failing to follow their doctrine of community relations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tampa Bay Rays are contenders for the World Series. That should cause a great deal of excitement among members of the community. Instead of punishing a student for taking an interest in community affairs, they should celebrate the fact that this young man is supporting a major income-producing business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I struggle in Iraq against a terrorist mindset in order to keep Zachary Sharples free to wear a Rayhawk in public without retribution. I would hate to think that I am winning the fight against terrorists in Iraq only to lose the same fight in the streets of Palmetto.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;His Decision Is Very Easy&quot; (Letter of the Day, Oct. 13):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">P.J. Corr's statement about Barack Obama's &quot;despicable character assassination of our men and women serving in Iraq&quot; is so sadly misinformed, it demands an answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the statement in question was about Afghanistan, not Iraq. Second, Corr obviously gets his &quot;information&quot; only from John McCain campaign ads, a notoriously unreliable source. Look at Factcheck.org every now and then. The full sentence, of which the ad plays only a fragment: &quot;We've got to get the job done there and that requires us to have enough troops so that we're not just air-raiding villages and killing civilians, which is causing enormous problems there.&quot; That is a candid assessment of the flawed strategy on the part of the current administration, which put those troops in this difficult position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If McCain has to resort to such despicable character assassination in his campaign ads, rather than an honest discussion of actual issues, what does that say about his own honor?</SPAN></P>

So what if he puts some zoo animals on his property for R&amp;R and has zoo personnel build two barns to accommodate them? He should be given a blank check to shuffle, trade and house animals wherever he deems it best and not have to answer to directors or anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, people who make fast decisions err, but that goes with the territory. He has brought the zoo back to life. People say he's a nice guy until you get in his way. Duh! Then get out of his way.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stores with which you compared Publix do not have the same services or selections. You have to bag your own groceries, pay for bags and carts, etc. That is a nuisance, and I would just as soon pay the few cents more to know that I am shopping at a full-service grocery store.</SPAN></P>

How ironic, considering their children, who are now of voting age. These same children who owe their citizenship and right to vote to him are planning on stabbing the savior in the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That bodes the question: Should we cork this loophole? Do we really need Americans who would be so disloyal? My wife is an immigrant citizen, but she did it the right way.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in some ways, the SAT has become more of a money-maker. Also, in each honor's class that I am taking, there is a hefty amount of homework each night. Studying for the SAT would cut into time for my education.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By WILLIAM MARCH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wmarch@tampatrib.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA - Sen. John McCain of Arizona, acknowledging that he's an underdog in the race for president, hopes to put together a more aggressive campaign in the final 22 days to make a comeback nationally and in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida McCain campaigners acknowledge that they have ground to make up, but they contend several factors are in their candidate's favor: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*In Florida, McCain will bring his ad spending into parity with Illinois Sen. Barack Obama's in the final three weeks. Obama has been outspending him 3-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*There's new optimism in the ranks. &quot;There's a sense that we bottomed out about last week,&quot; said McCain's state co-chairman, Brian Ballard. Realizing the campaign could be lost &quot;has gotten folks focused and motivated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*McCain has a history of coming from behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year in the primaries, McCain was written off, noted University of South Florida political scientist Darryl Paulson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was at the bottom of the pack and was carrying his own suitcases,&quot; Paulson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, Ballard said, &quot;is a stronger candidate coming from behind than as a frontrunner - his style is to finish strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain will also add a new line of attack, saying that a Republican president is needed in order to balance a Democratic-controlled Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters will hear the words &quot;Obama, Pelosi and Reid&quot; frequently from McCain and his partisans - a reference to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That argument, experts say, can appeal to voters, particularly independents, who mistrust single-party control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are the reasons for optimism for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasons for pessimism, however, are strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paulson compared McCain's situation to &quot;a baseball team down by six runs in the bottom of the ninth. You've got to have a grand slam plus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A betting person,&quot; he added, &quot;probably wouldn't bet on him at this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slide In National Polls</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, McCain has slid in polls to a position that he described Monday as about 6 points behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RealClearPolitics Web site, which averages published polls, declares it more than 7 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In individual battleground states, including Florida, the numbers are also worrisome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RealClearPolitics gives Obama an average lead in the Florida polls of 3.8 percentage points; while fivethirtyeight.com, which weights polls according to past accuracy, calls it 4.5 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida is the biggest of a handful of states that McCain must win to reach an Electoral College majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain will return this week, probably hitting Miami and Melbourne on Friday, campaign insiders said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama Not Worried</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Since last week, some national polls have indicated McCain may be narrowing the gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign said it's not worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No amount of nasty, false, television ads is going to change the fact that [McCain] and the Republicans are offering four more years of the same failed policies,&quot; said spokeswoman Adora Andy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's biggest problem, even his partisans acknowledge, is that the economy has come to dominate the race, and voters appear to give Obama the edge on that issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got to find a way to diminish Obama's advantage - either a different plan or a way to change the agenda to some other issue,&quot; Paulson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as he tries to turn the game around, however, McCain still seems to suffer from lack of coordination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policy Session Bashes Obama Plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a McCain confidant and frequent campaign surrogate, said Sunday that McCain would outline new economic proposals Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters were invited into a Monday afternoon conference call &quot;to discuss McCain's economic plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the call turned out to be about bashing Obama's economic proposals, and McCain made no announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior adviser Doug Holtz-Eakin said McCain &quot;will sketch out a vision&quot; on the economy, including some &quot;new specific measures&quot; today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain strategists have been saying McCain, with less money than Obama, would hold back for a strong finish in the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has outspent McCain on television advertising in Florida $2.2 million to $659,000 for the week that ended Oct. 4, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been assured we will be much closer to parity on TV buys in the last three weeks,&quot; Ballard said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers don't lie. The Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast held 1,035 pre-foreclosure counseling sessions in September -- a record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to topping the 1,000 mark, the number is up a whopping 172 percent from the 381 sessions performed in September 2007. And Jessica Cecere, local CCCS president, doesn't see any sign of a letup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither do financial service companies. Citigroup says recent increases in a key rate are expected to boost defaults among subprime loans by 10 percent. The increase affects adjustable-rate mortgages resetting next month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So distressed homeowners are flooding the CCCS to get counseling help in avoiding foreclosure. In fact, Cecere said the CCCS is under such strain that it now has 18 pre-foreclosure counselors, double the number from last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreclosure crisis has gained top billing in recent days as members of Congress, the president and both presidential candidates grapple with ways to address the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several nonprofit groups that advocate for borrowers had been pushing Congress to pass an aggressive provision to help homeowners stuck with mortgages they cannot afford. The provision would have allowed bankruptcy judges to modify mortgages in Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tina Talarchyk, a West Palm Beach bankruptcy lawyer, said this idea has been the talk of the bankruptcy Bar for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If that provision had been in there, it would have opened up a whole category of people who would be better able to adjust their finances,&quot; said Jordan Rappaport, a Boca Raton lawyer who specializes in Chapter 13 filings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the provision was removed from the $700 billion legislation and replaced with an exhortation that the Treasury Department &quot;encourage&quot; loan servicers to modify mortgages through certain loan programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathleen Day, a spokeswoman for the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit policy group in Washington, said the provision in the new bailout law may not be effective because it is a voluntary plan and would help a limited number of borrowers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A better model, Day said, is the plan being instituted by Bank of America as part of a settlement reached with 11 states, including Florida, with regard to Countrywide Financial. The mandatory loan program would reduce principal balances in some cases and cut interest rates in others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dean Sagar of AARP in Washington said the organization supported changing the bankruptcy code to permit Chapter 13 workouts because it would have gone to the heart of the problem: unaffordable mortgages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no purpose for Chapter 13 if the biggest debt the person has can't be restructured,&quot; Sagar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has pledged to revisit the Chapter 13 issue if elected. And in last Tuesday's debate, Republican presidential nominee John McCain said he would direct the federal government to purchase bad mortgages directly from homeowners and mortgage providers. The loans would be replaced with renegotiated fixed-rate mortgages. He estimates the program would cost taxpayers $300 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Day said her nonpartisan group would not endorse either candidate. But she was gratified that both candidates recognize that until the foreclosure crisis is resolved, the fundamentals of the economy will not be fixed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to stop this tidal wave of foreclosures,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cecere would not endorse either candidate, either. She stressed that any plan should create a way for borrowers to resolve their mortgage problems quickly, instead of having the process drag out for months, as it does now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to put expediency into the equation,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida doctors for McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign just announced a long list of Florida doctors who support the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As president, John McCain will work to reform our nation's health care system for the benefit of patients and health care providers alike,&quot; said State Sen. Durrell Peaden, honorary state co-chair of Florida Doctors for McCain-Palin. &quot;His plan to offer American families a $5,000 refundable tax credit will help 47 million uninsured Americans afford health care, and relieve a major burden for families already struggling to afford their insurance premiums. Only John McCain has offered proposals to make health insurance more innovative, portable and affordable, and I am confident he will take decisions out of the hands of employers and insurance companies and restore control to patients themselves. Choice is the most important thing for patients in health care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Full list below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Karl Altenburger, Honorary State Co-Chair of Florida Doctors for McCain-Palin and immediate past president of the Florida Medical Association, added: &quot;American families are deeply concerned about the rising costs of health care, especially during this time of economic uncertainty, but they are also concerned about quick, simple access to health care and acquiring the preventive care they need. Through more choice, competition, prevention, and the promotion of greater access to care, John McCain will make it possible for every American, including those with pre-existing conditions, to receive the health care they deserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Altenburger continued, &quot;As a physician, I also understand the importance of John McCain's call for immediate medical liability reform; this initiative is key to ensuring that physicians and patients are not burdened by the costs of frivolous lawsuits or excessive damage awards.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was all a joke(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB8iVgviw9w), played on Saturday Night Live. Yet despite that and other self-depreciating attempts to disarm questions about his age, the Republican presidential nominee faces ongoing scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest sign: More than 90 doctors in Florida have signed a national petition calling on McCain to fully release his medical records, suggesting that more about his bouts with skin cancer needs to be disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you still want to vote for the guy, that's fine. But you should know about it,&quot; said Dr. Max B. Rubin, a dermatologist in Delray Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to look to see if he's taking Viagra,&quot; said Tallahassee orthopedic surgeon Ray Bellamy. &quot;I want to see if there's strong evidence he's in good health or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, 72, would be the oldest president to take office if elected in November. His campaign dismissed the petition (which has nearly 2,900 signatures) as a stunt and noted it is driven by a group with ties to the liberal Moveon.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions of health have been a campaign issue since President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in 1955. In 1995, Republican nominee Bob Dole pre-empted questions by releasing records showing him in fine shape. It was the 73-year-old Dole who was pressuring a much younger and less willing President Bill Clinton to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida doctors - many who acknowledge they favor Democrat Barack Obama - say they are raising concerns because if something were to happen to McCain, his would-be vice president Sarah Palin would take over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's frightening to me to think she could be commander in chief,&quot; said Kathryn Price, a family doctor in Sarasota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign points out that McCain let reporters review nearly 1,200 pages of records this spring and talk with his doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, by contrast, has released a one-page summary. Obama, 47, was given a mostly clean bill of health, but he has been a smoker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The arbiters of this election are not demanding the same level of disclosure about Sen. Obama, who's essentially running on a doctor's note. I had a harder time getting out of high school gym class,&quot; said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama has a clean bill of health, as this letter shows,&quot; Obama's campaign said in a statement. &quot;With no surgery or hospital stays, the letter represents a complete summary of his doctor visits and medical records for the past two decades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions persist, in part due to the way McCain released the records. He allowed a select group of reporters to view the hundreds of pages, but journalists were limited to three hours and could not make copies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few medical experts doubt McCain's vigor. He has kept up an intense campaign schedule. He often points to his 96-year-old mother as evidence of his vitality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At issue are his four cases of malignant melanoma, beginning in 1993. In 2000, he was diagnosed with Stage IIa melanoma (Stage IV is the worst) on his left temple and he now bears the scar from that operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is generally held that the survival rate 10 years after Stage II diagnosis is 65 percent, and improves more after seven years. McCain has been cancer free for eight years, his doctors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for his puffy left cheek, doctors have said it is simply because his chewing muscle is more prominent as a result of the 2000 surgery, and it does not indicate the presence of cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubin said information from what McCain released is not enough to answer questions about the cancer's ability to spread, or metastasis. &quot;Anybody who is running for president should have a totally transparent health record,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like other Florida doctors, Rubin was asked to sign the petition by Brave New Films, a group that has produced short videos detailing negative aspects of McCain's life. Earlier this month, the group purchased a full-page ad (http://gobnf.org/i/trm/nyt_ad.pdf) in the New York Times naming all the doctors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. If they did, believe it or not, John McCain, would be beating Barack Obama in Florida. The McCain campaign currently lists 75 field offices in Florida, compared to 56 by Obama. Democrats are quick to note, though, that McCain's offices are mainly existing county GOP offices. If Obama counted existing Democratic offices, the campaign says at least 40 more offices would be added to his total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But don't get cocky about Obama attention on the Sunshine State, Florida Democrats. The Obama campaign lists 75 field offices in Ohio, and 81 in Pennsylvania. If you do the math, Obama campaign has 2.07 official field offices per Florida electoral vote, and 3.6 per Ohio electoral vote, and 3.85 Pennsylvania electoral vote. Virginia has 35 offices listed, or 2.69 per electoral vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. PETERSBURG -- Gov. Charlie Crist visited two Pinellas County businesses this afternoon, saying he wanted to help shine a spotlight on successful Florida companies, especially in a time of economic uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist toured Valpak, a direct-mail company that employs more than 1,000 people and sends thousands of packets of coupons to consumers. The company's high-tech equipment includes &quot;automatic guided vehicles,&quot; robots that can carry materials around the plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's important to emphasize these businesses that are doing well in the Sunshine State. I mean they told me that they're employing 1,500 people right here in Pinellas County,&quot; Crist said after visiting Valpak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, its parent company Cox Enterprises announced two months ago it wants to sell the company, including the $220-million facility that Crist toured.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Republican leaders form CCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who needs the Republican Party when you can raise money on your own? The incoming Speaker of the Florida House, Rep. Ray Sansom of Destin, has linked up with his presumed successors to raise money for a CCE called Leadership for Florida's Future (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/leadership_for_floridas_future.pdf).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its purpose seems similar to &quot;House Victory&quot; war chests long established by the party, raising questions about a rift. &quot;It's not a competitive effort; it's a complimentary effort,&quot; said Rep. Dean Cannon of Winter Park, who formed the organization. He added Sansom and Rep. Will Weatherford of Wesley Chapel so they too can raise money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My main thought is to help like-minded Republicans,&quot; Cannon said. &quot;This is probably going to be one of the toughest election cycles in a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee is off to a racing start with nearly $245,000 collected from August through September. (See for yourself here: http://election.dos.state.fl.us/cgi-bin/ComHtml.exe?account=46339) A whopping $100,000 came from one donor alone -- Crystal Beach Development Co. of Destin. Another $50,000 came from a CCE called Council for Senior Floridians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Records show $500 contributions to a number of House candidates, including Rachel Burgin of Tampa and Peter Boulware of Tallahassee. The committee also gave $10,000 toward the effort to pass a constitutional ban on gay marriage and contributed $10,000 to the Christian Coalition of Florida.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tampa Bay GOP leaders have confidence in McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid all the hand-wringing about the John McCain campaign in Florida and across the country -- and recent polls showing Barack Obama leading McCain in the critical battleground of the Tampa Bay area -- GOP chairs in the bay area remain confident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In our Republican stronghold areas here in Hillsborough the enthusiasm actually, I think, is greater than four years ago. They're just extremely scared on Obama,'' said Hillsborough GOP Chairman David Storck, who said the Brandon and Plant City offices last week made more than 13,000 phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pasco, GOP Chairman Bill Bunting predicts McCain will match Bush's nearly 75,000-vote advantage over Obama. Even in Democratic-leaning Pinellas, Republican Chairman Tony DiMatteo sounded mighty sure that McCain will win Pinellas: &quot;If I had a hundred dollar bill to put on red or black, like in Vegas, I'd put $100 on McCain (winning Pinellas).&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears about &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of voters being disenfranchised by the controversial &quot;no match (http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/state/article847368.ece)&quot; law are not adding up, but the number has grown to 9,259, according to new figures released today by the Department of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Sept. 8, when the law was first enforced, there have been 376,450 new voter registrations. Of those, 56,807 have been tagged under the law for having a mismatching driver's license or Social Security number. But the state has resolved the bulk -- all but 13,339 -- of the cases without even notifying the voter. County elections officials throughout the state report that another 4,080 have been resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means 9,259 would-be voters are still in limbo. They have until two days after the election to fix the problem for their vote to count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're seeking reaction from one of the lawyers who filed suit against the state. In what could be a razor-tight election, every vote could matter, so the stakes are high.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His TV advertising fights with Democrat Linda Bird have largely been about who is a two-faced tool of the property insurance industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But lately, Republican Jeff Atwater, the North Palm Beach banker who would become Florida Senate president if reelected, is trying to insure himself against a surge that has little to do with hurricanes or ocean water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm aware there has been an impressive number of registrations taking place, more so Democrats than Republicans,&quot; Atwater said Friday evening, shortly before meeting with dozens of supporters in a Lighthouse Point home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point he started to refer to the last name of the Democratic presidential candidate, then amended his phrasing to the &quot;tops of the tickets&quot; when discussing what may be influencing registration trends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's taking nothing lightly, Atwater said: &quot;I'm going to houses all over the district and talking to voters almost every single night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats are touting an almost 2-to-1 advantage statewide in the registration of new voters this election season -- 360,000 new voters through September, compared with 190,000 for Republicans. Nearly half of the new Democratic voters are younger than 35.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama led GOP rival John McCain by 4 points in Florida in a recent CNN poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's throwing a wild card into a campaign where, by almost every measure, Atwater seems to hold a strong hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has amassed a war chest of historic proportions, raising $2.5 million to get reelected. That represents a 38-to-1 money advantage over Bird, a Fort Lauderdale Realtor who got into the race after former state Sen. Skip Campbell dropped out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campbell, a wealthy trial lawyer, was expected to give Atwater a battle on the fund-raising front but cited health reasons for withdrawing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican edge in voter registrations in Florida Senate District 25, an affluent coastal swath of Palm Beach and Broward counties, tightened to 39 percent vs. 36 percent Democratic as of July 28, the latest figures available on the state Division of Elections site. By comparison, GOP registrations led Democrats 46 percent to 33 percent in the same territory at the start of George W. Bush's presidency nearly eight years ago, according to the state Senate Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At best, Bird still faces a steep uphill fight. Her opponent holds big advantages in money, name recognition and political experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Democratic Party ads are trying to use Atwater's fund-raising success against him, painting him as a &quot;hypocrite&quot; who took money from insurance interests when it was convenient and later tried to portray himself as a homeowners advocate when it became politically popular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With these hard economic times, he has got to understand it's time for a change,&quot; Bird said of Atwater at a Fort Lauderdale fund-raiser attended by former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. &quot;His views are not shared by moderate Floridians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on the ballot: Anthony Joseph Mauro, a recent college graduate in Lantana running under the banner of the Green Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to reach Mauro were not successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bird, who has never held state office, has tried to draw contrasts with Atwater, saying she would be more supportive of public schools, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe she's somebody who can really make a difference,&quot; Reno said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Atwater has called in his own commercial barrage. TV spots cast him as a champion of little-guy homeowners fighting the abuses of property insurers. One mailer blasts Bird as someone who would raise taxes -- she denies it as standard playbook material. Another mail piece proclaims Atwater a &quot;reformer&quot; who will protect the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in a Republican-majority district, his campaign is tossing out anecdotes about a Democrats for Atwater movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Democratic Party spokesman Eric Jotkoff detects signs of nervousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's running from his own record,&quot; Jotkoff said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is impossible to know whether any registration surge will translate to actual votes Nov. 4, and if so, whether it can lift boats like Bird's. The predominantly white district has earned a reputation as a &quot;soft&quot; Republican district, where Democrats such as state Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink have done well in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atwater said door-to-door politics have helped anchor him against shifting currents before. He won a state House seat by 20 points in a district that Democrat Al Gore took by 4 points in the 2000 presidential race, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jeff Atwater is not a guy who takes anything for granted,&quot; said Atwater consultant Rick Wilson. &quot;I would be shocked if he hasn't knocked on 20,000 doors in the district. He's old school. He definitely will counteract a lot of this national stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of being perceived as a show of strength in a critical state, John McCain's recent flurry of ads in Florida's expensive television markets has some supporters second-guessing the direction of the Republican's presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the negative ads are going to backfire on him,&quot; said state Sen. Mike Bennett, a statewide chairman of Florida Veterans for John McCain. &quot;It's poor management of the entire campaign that's put him in the position he's in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As McCain and Democratic nominee Barack Obama increase their presence on Florida airwaves heading into the final 23 days of the campaign, both candidates have been slapped by nonpartisan fact-check groups for negative and disingenuous advertisements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the eve of their second presidential debate, McCain and Obama released TV ads accusing one another of untruthful attacks,&quot; according to a report from Factcheck.org on Tuesday. &quot;Both are essentially accurate, though each tells only half the story.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project, 73 percent of McCain's ads and 61 percent of Obama's ads have been negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that rate continues, it would easily surpass the presidential campaigns in 2004, when 64 percent of President Bush's ads and 34 percent of John Kerry's ads were negative, according to the advertising project, which is affiliated with the university's political science department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hitting specific targets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain returned to Florida's airwaves in September for the first time since the state's January presidential primary, while Obama's&nbsp;commercials have been airing in Florida since June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are looking for ideas right now, and we should have positive ads about what he's going to do to turn this economy around,&quot; Bennett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bennett, a Bradenton Republican, has a good idea of the ads on television: In the Tampa-St. Petersburg market where he lives, Obama and McCain combined recently to air more ads than in all but four other markets in the country, according to the Wisconsin Advertising Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, McCain targeted more than half of his 4,600 TV spots to swing voters in the crucial Interstate 4 corridor, according to Nielsen Monitor-Plus. Since Obama began broadcasting in Florida in June, nearly 40 percent of his 15,000 ads have been televised in the same stretch from Orlando to Tampa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West Palm Beach-Fort Pierce market has been targeted with 22 percent of McCain's Florida general election ads, while Obama televised 11 percent of his in the same area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of particular concern to Bennett and other Republicans is McCain's recent strategy to connect Obama to 1960s radical William Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin started including references to Ayers in her speeches Tuesday in Florida. On Friday, the McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee released a television ad accusing Obama of lying about whether he has a connection to Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Factcheck.org called the ad &quot;groundless, false, dubious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Julio Robaina, R-Miami, co-chairman of McCain's Florida Hispanic Leadership Coalition, was not critical of the campaign's decision to run the commercial, but added that he refuses to talk to voters about anything other than issues such as McCain's plans for the economy, health care and Social Security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a lot closer to the voters on the ground,&quot; he said. &quot;At this level, the issues need to be addressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Area GOP leader frustrated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palm Beach County Republican Party Chairman Sid Dinerstein said the meltdown of the country's financial markets turned a two-year presidential campaign into &quot;a brand-new election.&quot; &quot;John McCain's response to the meltdown was not strong enough to keep him ahead,&quot; Dinerstein said, noting that McCain led in most Florida polls before the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dinerstein said McCain should continue talking about Ayers, but said Ayers should be paired with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, another Chicago resident, and ACORN, a New Orleans-based group that Obama worked with as a community organizer, to paint the Illinois senator as an &quot;inner-city radical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are all somewhat frustrated by John McCain's unwillingness to make that case to America,&quot; Dinerstein said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign released an advertisement Friday in Indiana called &quot;Chicago Way,&quot; which attempts to tie Obama to Ayers and two other Chicago political figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of McCain's top national campaign advisers described the new ads as an attempt at &quot;turning the page on the financial crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, some strategists said the move was necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several pointed out that McCain resuscitated his struggling campaign last year, when fund-raising struggles had many writing him off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We could have another crisis in Afghanistan or Iraq that could change the whole complexion of this race,&quot; said Barney Bishop, CEO of Associated Industries of Florida, which endorsed McCain on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Charlie Crist, who endorsed McCain in the state's presidential primary, said the Republican's message is &quot;firing up the base.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Negative is in the eye of the beholder,&quot; Crist said. &quot;There is always a back and forth, especially toward the ends of these campaigns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appealing to fears</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the edge in the polls Obama has enjoyed since the stock market plunged has not kept the Democrat from attempting to skewer his opponent's image, according to Factcheck.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, Obama's ads have called McCain a &quot;big spender&quot; who proposed a health care plan that would &quot;leave you on your own to pay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another spot blasts McCain's tax policy, claiming the country would need to &quot;borrow from China to fund his spending spree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an ad targeted in the West Palm Beach market, Obama's campaign characterizes the &quot;Bush-McCain privatization plan&quot; as &quot;cutting Social Security in half.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a falsehood sure to frighten seniors who rely on their Social Security checks,&quot; according to Factcheck.org. &quot;In truth, McCain does not propose to cut those checks at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Ron Saunders, D-Key West, defended Obama's ads, saying, &quot;Generally speaking, the reason why people run negative ads and the reason they're effective is because they deal with issues that directly affect them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Republican consultant Cory Tilley said it's too early to gauge the effect of the ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though the Obama campaign is riding high on cloud nine right now, these races tend to tighten,&quot; Tilley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's got to be a fear in the back of their mind that you don't want your campaign to peak at the beginning of October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to be the candidate who peaks on Nov. 4.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain&nbsp;ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMBITION: Released Friday, running nationally. Claims Obama 'lied'about his connection to former 1960s radical William Ayers and blames 'congressional liberals'for promoting subprime loans, loosening financial regulations and the market meltdown that followed. 'In crisis we need leadership, not bad judgment.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAVAGERY: The group is airing this spot in Florida, Colorado and Michigan in an effort to discredit GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. The ad claims Palin 'promotes'controlling Alaska's wolf population by using airplanes to shoot the animals and shows video clips of the animals being gunned down. 'Palin even proposed a $150 bounty for each severed foreleg,'the narrator says. 'Do we really want a vice president who champions such savagery?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Rifle Association</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEXAS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: One of three ads the group is airing in Florida and about a dozen other states. The spot features a Hispanic man, identified as a retired police officer, who tells viewers that Obama supports prosecuting individuals who use a firearm in self-defense. 'Families should be able to defend themselves against rapists, drug dealers and other criminals illegally crossing our borders.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama&nbsp;ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMPUESTOS: Spanish language spot released Friday, running in Florida, New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada --all battleground states. The ad depicts McCain's tax cut as a boon for corporations and insurance companies and criticizes his health plan as expensive for workers. 'Estos son los hechos de su plan que McCain y los republicanos quieren ocultarle al pueblo,'the narrator says. ('These are the facts about his plan that McCain and the Republicans want to hide from the public.')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential ads in Florida</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nominees Barack Obama and John McCain have stepped up their advertising in Florida in the past month. Both campaigns are targeting the Interstate 4 corridor as well as West Palm Beach and the rest of Southeast Florida.<BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know. Your TV dance card is already full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TiVo is filling up with episodes of Mad Men and Dexter, while you struggle to track who gets kicked off Survivor and Dancing With the Stars each week before surfing to Hulu or iTunes to catch Tina Fey's latest devastating Sarah Palin sketch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are more new shows coming this week - a final burst to complete the new fall schedule. And a lot of them are actually pretty good. So clear space on your favorites list. Here are a few more can't-miss series: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My Own Worst Enemy, 10 p.m. Monday, WFLA-Ch. 8: Yes, this story of a guy with a chip in his head switching personalities between a superspy killer and his office-worker cover identity feels like a Bourne Identity ripoff. But you won't care much, given NBC's lush production values and Christian Slater's lean, focused take on spy Edward and normal guy Henry. Just ignore the huge Chevrolet commercial embedded in the show's middle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eli Stone, 10 p.m. Tuesday, WFTS-Ch. 28: Last year, I couldn't believe a show about a guy with a brain growth giving him prophetic visions could be so entertaining. Now, after an operation to remove the growth, San Francisco lawyer Eli Stone finds he liked the delusions - including surprise appearances by George Michael - more than he knew. And so did his friends. Extra points for an inspired turn by Sigourney Weaver as his therapist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chocolate News, 10:30 p.m. Wednesday, Comedy Central: David Alan Grier leads this side-splitting take on a black-centered news network, kicking off with a screed on the death of hip-hop by dissing 50 Cent for selling vitamin water and ridiculing DMX's arrest for parking in a handicapped space. Grier plays most roles here, donning a fat suit to play a rapper who films an explicit promotional video for the No Child Left Behind program. It's worse - and better - than you can imagine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crash, 10 p.m. Friday, Starz: Uber weirdo Dennis Hopper is typically over the top as an unhinged record producer who enjoys abusing his chauffeurs and talking to his, um, equipment. Like the Oscar-winning film, this explicit series tracks the sordid, messy lives of several Los Angelenos across race and class lines. And, like the movie, it's hard to find a moral in the parade of corrupt cops, Asian gangbangers and desperate suburbanites whose stories cross and collide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crusoe, 10 p.m. Friday, WFLA: Filmed on location with a high budget, this revival of stranded 17th century Englishman Robinson Crusoe's classic story turns Friday into a friend rather than a manservant and Crusoe into an island refugee capable of building machines worthy of Rube Goldberg or MacGyver. Crusoe needs them when he's caught between murderous pirates and Spanish soldiers; cameos from Sean Bean and Sam Neill only add to the prestige.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TiVo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Final presidential debate, 9 p.m. Wednesday, all major broadcast networks, cable news channels, PBS and C-SPAN: With an increasingly desperate John McCain now 0 for 2 in debate performances, expect him and Barack Obama to stretch the rules as far as possible to avoid an actual debate. Here's hoping moderator Bob Schieffer has better luck than his predecessors in forcing a debate, rather than hosting a succession of focus group-ready mini stump speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ti-Maybe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Little People, Big World, 8 p.m. Monday, TLC: Reality shows can add a quick shot of drama by sending the star to visit troops in Iraq, where they marvel at bullet-riddled Humvees and pontificate about the danger. Still, little person Matt Roloff's trip to Iraq, bringing a physician expert in dwarfism to visit a family with three dwarf children, is touching. As a bonus, the focus on dynamic Matt cuts screen time for his bratty kids and unappreciative wife.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain proposes repealing the long-standing tax exemption on employer-provided insurance.

They might choose to use their employer's plan and use the tax credit to offset the new tax on the benefit, or they might go off and buy insurance on their own. Ideally, this will increase competition among health care plans. The tax credit is payable to insurance companies as a way of ensuring that people use it to buy health insurance. Any extra money would go to a special health care spending account. There's ample evidence that the plan would be a wash for most workers. The McCain campaign says only those with &quot;gold-plated&quot; coverage would do worse. An analysis from the nonpartisan Urban Institute confirms it: &quot;In general, lower-income people with health insurance would receive benefits from the credit that would be well in excess of the value that they receive from today's tax exemption.&quot; So McCain's health plan does not leave you &quot;on your own&quot; to pay a health insurance tax.

So even by a generous definition, Obama does not fine &quot;small businesses.&quot; Indeed, they are not even subject to the mandate. We rate McCain's claim False.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health care ad is right - until the end</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's health care plan &quot;leaves you on your own to pay McCain's health insurance tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Oct. 3 in a TV ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain proposes repealing the long-standing tax exemption on employer-provided insurance. But in exchange, he proposes a tax credit of $2,500 per person to spend on any health insurance they wish. They might choose to use their employer's plan and use the tax credit to offset the new tax on the benefit, or they might go off and buy insurance on their own. Ideally, this will increase competition among health care plans. The tax credit is payable to insurance companies as a way of ensuring that people use it to buy health insurance. Any extra money would go to a special health care spending account. There's ample evidence that the plan would be a wash for most workers. The McCain campaign says only those with &quot;gold-plated&quot; coverage would do worse. An analysis from the nonpartisan Urban Institute confirms it: &quot;In general, lower-income people with health insurance would receive benefits from the credit that would be well in excess of the value that they receive from today's tax exemption.&quot; So McCain's health plan does not leave you &quot;on your own&quot; to pay a health insurance tax. His plan gives you a credit to work with. We rate Obama's statement Barely True.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their past positions and their plans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHN MCCAIN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Ends the longtime tax exemption on employer-provided health insurance and replaces it with a $2,500 credit. This move aims to create more competition among health insurance providers and improve efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Will ask the states to help create coverage plans to insure those with pre-existing conditions. Promotes electronic recordkeeping and greater access to preventive care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BARACK OBAMA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Workers who like their health care plan keep their coverage. Other can buy affordable coverage through national pools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Also promotes electronic recordkeeping and preventive care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANALYSIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent groups like the Commonwealth Fund found that McCain would cover an additional 2-million of the uninsured, while Obama would cover an additional 34-million. By 2018, McCain's plan would cost $1.3-billion; Obama's plan would cost $1.6-billion. &quot;Obama's proposal for mixed private-public group insurance ... has greater potential to move the health care system toward high performance than does McCain's proposal to encourage individual market coverage through the use of tax incentives and deregulation,&quot; its report concludes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, trying hard to be the country's next No. 2, lunged for the throat last week by suggesting Barack Obama &quot;. . . is someone who sees America, it seems, as being so imperfect that he's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was citing a New York Times article about Obama's relationship with Weather Underground co-founder Bill Ayers, which concluded that the two &quot;do not appear to have been close.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers is now a well-respected academic and a distinguished professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He and Obama met in 1995 while involved in the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, a foundation dealing with urban education issues. They live in the same neighborhood, sat on the Woods Fund board together, and their children went to the same school. The Obama campaign's David Axelrod said they were &quot;certainly friendly&quot; because of those circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we wondered, under the same parameters, who else is palling around with this terrorist?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a short list of prominent people at least as connected to Ayers as Barack Obama. Many of them served on various boards with Ayers, while others consider him a friend and associate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Each candidate blames the other. They're both right. And wrong.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this complex financial crisis, the presidential candidates have the biggest megaphone of all to help us understand the mess we're in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But relying on them for an unvarnished view is like asking competing trial attorneys to provide the &quot;facts&quot; of a case. You'll get some facts, but in a light that's most friendly to their client.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second presidential debate last week, Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama laid out their explanations of the root causes of the financial crisis. Both say they sounded warnings that could have lessened the problem, and both blamed the other for helping to cause it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the McCain version: &quot;One of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire, was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis. But you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Sen. Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's side: &quot;Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system. Sen. McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reality, the crisis was caused by a &quot;perfect storm&quot; of economic factors with lots of blame to go around, both in the private sector and government quarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent panel discussion on the crisis, Jay Light, dean of the faculty at Harvard Business School, likened it to a train wreck &quot;caused by a collision of a collapsing housing bubble and a new but untested financial system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than the old system in which a highly regulated bank would buy and hold a person's home mortgage, a system evolved whereby mortgage brokers would originate loans, bundle them, then quickly sell them to Wall Street, where the loans were packaged into securities, cut and sliced, sold and resold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Role of derivatives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another factor was subprime loans, which are loans at higher interest rates made to people perceived to be greater lending risks. Elected officials encouraged the relaxation of mortgage standards, motivated by the noble goal of trying to get all Americans into homes - even low- and moderate-income people with poor credit histories. The effort increased the number of home buyers, goosing housing demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But investment banks loved what the government was doing and encouraged it. Worldwide savings were soaring, and international investors were hungry for a safe place to park their money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mortgage-backed securities appeared to be virtually risk-free on paper, premised as they were on ever-rising home prices. And, once-obscure derivatives - the credit default swap, a private contract that pays off in case of a defaulted loan - were specifically exempted from government regulation. Today, nobody knows the true value of these investments, given foreclosures and mortgage defaults, and that is what's causing the credit crunch - a general reluctance to lend money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But let's start with McCain's version, with the government agencies called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set up decades ago by the federal government to underwrite mortgages and promote home ownership, Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.) became major players in the domestic mortgage market. They don't make loans to homeowners directly, but they purchase mortgages, bundle them into securities, and sell some of them on the open market. Together, Fannie and Freddie owned or guaranteed about $5-trillion in mortgages, about half of the U.S. market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After years of rapid growth in home prices, foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies began rising by 2006. Some homeowners had adjustable-rate mortgages that were resetting to higher rates they could no longer afford. In other cases, speculators were overextended and dumping properties. Outright fraud had some role: people who took out loans never intending to pay them back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of the reasons, by 2008 foreclosures were affecting Fannie and Freddie. The agencies didn't have enough money to meet their financial obligations, and the U.S. government took them over on Sept. 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fannie and Freddie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's statement suggests that Fannie and Freddie made too many risky loans, and that caused today's crisis. Most economists agree that Fannie and Freddie did encourage looser lending standards, but they disagree on whether the agencies were leading the way or following the pack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's also McCain's second point, that Democrats encouraged Fannie and Freddie to take on more risky loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer depends on the point in history you choose to look at. In the late 1990s, the Republican-controlled Congress - with the blessing of Democratic President Bill Clinton - eased the credit requirements on loans that Fannie and Freddie purchased. Fannie and Freddie grew rapidly, and at some point executives started manipulating earnings reports and violating basic accounting principles. Federal investigators uncovered the misconduct, resulting in a scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2006, McCain did, in fact, sign on to a Republican-led attempt at regulatory overhaul of the mortgage-financing firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole,&quot; McCain declared in a May 26, 2006, news release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Bipartisan problem'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, McCain's current attempts to depict those efforts as an early warning that could have lessened the current credit crisis don't wash. McCain was talking about potential fallout from accounting troubles, not freewheeling lending standards based on a housing bubble. And he said nothing about major financial institutions becoming badly leveraged on bad loans and new securities products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While McCain is quick to blame Democrats for opposing the legislation - they did - the Republican-controlled Congress (with a Republican in the White House) didn't get around to a regulatory overhaul when it held power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a bipartisan problem,&quot; said Bill Beach, director of the Center for Data Analysis at the conservative Heritage Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's argument is that deregulation caused the problem. That's not technically accurate - deregulation implies regulations were done away with. In the case of the economic crisis, there was a bit of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, gave an exemption to investment banks in 2004 that allowed them to take on much more debt. But credit default swaps were never regulated in the first place. In 1999, Republicans passed legislation, signed by Clinton, specifically exempting them from regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some regulatory agencies had regulation powers that they never utilized or didn't utilize well. The Federal Reserve has the power to tighten lending standards, for instance, or raise interest rates. But former Chairman Alan Greenspan discouraged new rules and advised Congress repeatedly not to regulate derivatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were lots of regulatory failures, and it would be reasonable to blame regulators for not detecting problems and acting on them sooner,&quot; said Charles Calomiris, a professor at Columbia Business School and a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. &quot;But deregulation means the removal of regulatory barriers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's certainly fair to say that McCain has historically been an advocate for deregulation of business. In March, as Obama has repeatedly noted, McCain boasted to the Wall Street Journal, &quot;I am fundamentally a deregulator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Obama to suggest McCain's deregulation efforts are to blame for the current financial crisis is misleading. In that same article, McCain said there was a need for government oversight of the subprime lending market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lax regulation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calomiris called Obama's deregulation argument &quot;discouragingly dishonest&quot; as &quot;the only deregulation in banking of any significance (branching deregulation, and allowing commercial banks to underwrite corporate securities) had nothing to do with the subprime crisis. Said differently, everyone (including commercial banks) who underwrote or bought subprime paper would have been able to do so long before deregulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But lax regulation contributed to the crisis more than Fannie and Freddie, in the opinion of another economist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I put the first blame with the Fed and their failure to rein in the bubble,&quot; said Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama did send a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and the new Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, in March 2007, advising a meeting on the subprime mortgage mess. &quot;We cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes,&quot; Obama wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But economists agree that it was too late by that point, a point that economists Baker and Calomiris agree on. In separate interviews, they both used the same analogy: The horse was already out of the barn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The subprime market basically blew up in 2007,&quot; Baker said. &quot;It was too late by then.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Now that folksy is in, I don't mind admitting that the first line of Joe Biden's latest e-mail reminded me of my grandmother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The McCain campaign is on the ropes,&quot; Biden wrote Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't count your chickens before they hatch,&quot; my grandmother used to say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Aesop wrote fables, people have known that it's dangerous to assume they'll have something before it's in their hands. That's especially true for presidential campaigns with three weeks to go until Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet, it's hard to fault Barack Obama and running mate Biden for a burst of confidence this close to the finish line. John McCain's campaign legs do look shaky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many pundits are rushing to declare the presidential election over. Some are even talking about an Obama landslide. That's because polls show Obama with a widening lead over John McCain nationally and Obama gaining ground in key states. Other polls show that people trust Obama more than McCain to fix the devastated economy. The stars seem to be aligning in Obama's favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political scientist Larry Sabato said Thursday that for the first time it appears that Obama has the necessary 270 electoral votes to win, with more on the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the 2000 election taught us anything, it's that it's not over until the Supreme Court says it's over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, this isn't the first time McCain had been declared dead. One year before he accepted the Republican presidential nomination, he was written off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's always risky to assume pollsters know the voters' minds, especially this year. Besides, what's the harm in waiting for people to vote and have their votes counted before anointing the winner?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, an October surprise could still alter the presidential race. So far, what's got everybody's attention is the stock market's shocking plunge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current economic anxiety redounds to Obama's benefit, because people think he's better able to deal with the crisis, pollsters say. Plus, Obama's storied cool demeanor is serving him well, while McCain can't get his economic footing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the second debate, McCain tried to put himself on the side of ordinary Americans by saying he would have the federal government buy bad home mortgages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama seized on the issue and said that McCain wanted to &quot;massively overpay&quot; for the mortgages. He put up a campaign ad, arguing that the country can't afford &quot;more of the same&quot; on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a page from Republican presidential campaigns gone by, McCain's chief strategy seems to be to try to scare people off Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who is the real Senator Obama?&quot; McCain asks at rallies. He and Sarah Palin have tied Obama to Vietnam Era-radical William Ayers and other unsavory characters. They impugn Obama's honesty as well as his policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem with the personal attacks, Michelle Obama told Jon Stewart on &quot;The Daily Show,&quot; is that Obama has been on the campaign trail for 20 months. He survived a bitter primary campaign in which his competitors threw out many of the same questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, does McCain really want to remind voters about his friendship with political donor Charles Keating Jr? That led to McCain's being one of the senators implicated in the Keating Five scandal during the collapse of the savings and loan industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, yes, Biden shouldn't count his chickens before they hatch. And McCain should remember something else my grandmother said, &quot;People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hey government, I've maxed out my credit cards, I'm about to lose my house, my car - everything - due to some very bad decisions on my part (mainly trying to get rich quick at Seminole Hard Rock). Please give me $1 million before I lose it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I promise I'll only spend one week at Safety Harbor Spa and will take my own car and not valet park. Well, what do you say?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's all a joke, of course, but this isn't: the audacity of those AIG people to take the money the government (that means you and me) gave them and send the greedy morons to a resort spa! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does anyone else think we are fast losing all sense of right and wrong in this country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next time government, get a &quot;prenup&quot; so no one else uses our money for anything other than keeping people in jobs and with health care, and the company viable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's Take Back Streets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I applaud Pinellas County for passing an ordinance that will hopefully put an end to people using their roadways and medians to collect money and/or sell goods. It is an eyesore, and for obvious reasons it is very unsafe for everyone involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there may be good causes that will suffer, such as the fireman who collect money for charity in their boots, I believe there are many more people who are out there just to make beer and cigarette money for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then don't even get me started on the masses of &quot;beggars&quot; who misrepresent themselves by collecting for bogus churches just for some pocket change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While panhandling may be OK according to the Constitution, I don't think our forefathers envisioned eight-lane intersections with traffic whizzing by while pedestrians stand in each median and walk in between cars with buckets asking people to throw change out their windows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Hillsborough County Commission and Tampa City Council: I beg you to consider a similar ordinance so drivers and homeowners can finally take back our streets. Please give the sheriff's office and police departments the tools they need to end soliciting in the streets, which has somehow swelled to epidemic proportions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digging A Bigger Hole</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am a high school junior. I am writing in response to Sen. Mel Martinez's view on the bailout plan (&quot;A Rescue Plan For America&quot; (Another View, Oct. 7). Are you confident this plan will work?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't understand how cutting taxes will help this economy get out of debt. Wouldn't we be digging ourselves into an even bigger hole? We'll have less revenue for things like student loans and still have to pay back the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, I know, we can get the money from the good people who work two or three jobs and pay their taxes on time. Even if the government bails out the banks now, in another year this could happen again. Eventually, the bailouts have to stop, and businesses need to be responsible for their own decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In two years I will be able to vote, but the choices we make now will affect me the rest of my life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where Was Martinez?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Martinez's article attempts to justify his vote supporting the $700 billion bailout. Where were he and his comrades on the Banking Committee as Wall Street ran out of control?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, this is not my idea of the American dream. It might be yours but not anyone else I know.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They Should Resign First</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We the people should be outraged. We are paying our senators to run for president and vice president (at least one) when they are neglecting their duties. Our economy is a disaster while they spend two years flying around the country wasting fuel, and all they are doing is pointing their fingers at each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They run back to Washington, D.C., to cast a bailout vote that was clearly not the will of the people. Then it's back on the campaign trail, bragging what a great job they are doing. What a joke!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should demand that if they want to run for another office, they must resign from their current position first. How many of us can take two years looking for another job? Oh, by the way, if you don't get that job, you lose nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time for real change in Washington.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Camelot' Was Misnamed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our current presidential race has eerie parallels to the presidential race of 1960. That race pitted the sweaty, nervous-looking, paranoid, foreign policy expert (see China) Richard Nixon against the Harvard-educated, philandering, inexperienced liberal, John F. Kennedy. Most experts agree the race was won on the televised debates because of the appearance of Kennedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That decisive election began the 1960s, when only two years later the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis nearly triggered the destruction of the continental United States through nuclear attack because of Kennedy's clear lack of understanding and decisiveness on foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The '60s continued with assassinations (J. Kennedy, R. Kennedy, M.L. King), social upheaval and the Vietnam war, which continued for 12 years under Democratic administrations and ended under a Republican in the early 1970s. Camelot? Please. Those were not good years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world is far more dangerous and volatile today. Electing Barack Obama will make the U.S. and its population more vulnerable than ever. John McCain is not the greatest choice, but he is the only choice this Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young people, please read up on and into history. It does repeat itself. Vote McCain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paying Taxes Is Patriotic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to Tom Friedman for highlighting the moral bankruptcy of the tax rants of John McCain and Sarah Palin (&quot;Palin's Strange Brand Of Patriotism&quot; Other Views, Oct. 9).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans value a strong nation, a secure economy and future, adequate health care and, consistent with our values, a nation that ensures these things for all citizens. Paying taxes commensurate with our prosperity in order to strengthen our nation is a defining American value. It is the sacrifice we all can make for our nation and our commitment to creating and supporting a strong, cohesive, safe and fair United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's insistence that selfless sacrifice and contribution to the common strength and defense of our nation are illnesses requiring relief is unpatriotic and un-American. It appeals to selfishness, to an empty, me-first hedonistic society where anything goes, self-interest runs amok, businesses enrich themselves and the lives of the American people are left in ruins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It exhorts us to turn our back on American tradition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's Ride Industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Friedman's idea of being patriotic by paying more taxes is not my idea. I am also from Minnesota, and in the 1960s the governor asked to have a sales tax started and in five years the state income tax would be ended, That was almost 50 years ago, and the state still has a state tax along with the sales tax. It's just one lie after another to get more money to spend on pet projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the taxpayers are not patriotic by paying more taxes, then what about Congress voting not to fund our military? Was that being patriotic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If our government would spend the money for things the people and country need, I would not object. But Nancy Pelosi wanting a 747 to ride around in - that's too much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are in a mess right now, and who put us there? Not the taxpayer but our great leaders who have been around since the 1970s, when we were told that oil was in short commodity. It's now time for Congress to get its head out of the sand and let private industry do their thing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make Up Mind, State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently the Tribune has forgotten why Supervisor of Elections Buddy Johnson is spending vast amounts of money on this year's election. Since the 2000 hanging-chads debacle and the 2006 Sarasota contested and protracted congressional race, Johnson has been forced to purchase entirely new voting machines and train workers and apprise the voting public on their usage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Florida Legislature could make up its collective minds and quit bending in the wind to every challenge to voting equipment, perhaps Florida voters, who, in turn, are taxpayers, would not have to be bearing the burden of millions spent on the latest voting devices and innovations.</SPAN></P>

And so on to ad infinitum and ad nauseum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, I would like a change from all this. Just stop. I don't want to think about how much money could be used for change. My chances of achieving such a change is the same as my standing in front of a hurricane and changing its path by waving a fan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an unprecedented display of television advertising and field organization for a Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama has moved Florida to the forefront of his battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signs are everywhere that Obama is making a serious play for a state that most experts believed would back Republican presidential candidate John McCain in the end. Half of the Obama campaign's top six national TV advertising markets are in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the ground, the Obama campaign has assembled what experts say is the largest army of paid and volunteer staff for a Democratic campaign in the state's history. And this week, Obama dispatched two of his top campaign deputies to focus on the final stretch of the race here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karl Koch, the Democratic strategist who ran Bill Clinton's successful Florida campaign in 1996 and was an adviser for Al Gore in 2000, said Obama's advertising advantage was unprecedented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In '96 and 2000, where we had races that were aggressively competitive in the state, we never reached those kinds of numbers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the week of Sept. 28-Oct. 4, Obama had a 3-to-1 spending advantage over McCain. Obama spent $2.2 million on television advertising in Florida, compared with only $659,000 for McCain, according to new data released by University of Wisconsin political scientists who are monitoring the national advertising campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heavy advertising -- a result of Obama's fundraising advantage over McCain -- opens the possibility that Obama could carry the state, which has not been won by a Democrat since Bill Clinton's re-election in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertising blitz underscores the importance of Florida as one of Obama's national priorities. Half of the Democratic candidate's top national advertising markets are in the state: Tampa, Orlando and Miami, according to the Wisconsin report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the week of Sept. 28 to Oct. 4, only television viewers in Las Vegas -- which was saturated with 1,288 Obama ads -- saw more commercials than viewers in Tampa Bay, where 1,069 Obama ads ran. In contrast, McCain only ran 364 ads in the Tampa market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another critical Interstate 4 market, Obama ran 908 ads in the Orlando area, compared with 417 for McCain. Obama also had 824 ads in the Miami market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koch said Obama's heavy emphasis on Florida will force McCain to defend the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no math that gets the Republican nominee into the White House without Florida; it cannot happen,&quot; Koch said. &quot;As you saw in 1996 with Bill Clinton, when the Democrat has the ability to come in here and take Florida, it's over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from the advertising advantage, Koch and other Democratic strategists say Obama has put in place the largest &quot;ground army&quot; they have seen for a Democratic presidential candidate in Florida, including some 50 field offices, more than 450 paid staffers and tens of thousands of volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign organization was responsible in part for a voter registration drive that netted the Democrats 45 percent of the 804,000 new voters who registered between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30. The Republicans claimed 24 percent of the new voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign is now focused on turning out those new voters as well as the party regulars for the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koch, who has also run gubernatorial campaigns in the state, said Obama's field organization was &quot;bigger than anything I've ever been associated with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In comparison, Democrat John Kerry only had 20 field offices in 2004, said Eric Jotkoff, who was one of Kerry's state field organizers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another sign of Obama's emphasis on Florida was his decision this week to bring in two of his national campaign aides -- Steve Hildebrand, the deputy campaign manager, and Paul Tewes, an elections organizing specialist -- to help Steve Schale, who has been running Obama's Florida campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tewes, who ran Obama's Iowa campaign, was credited with helping Obama pull off that early caucus victory that provided momentum for his successful primary campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It speaks directly to and exactly how important and close that they think Florida is,&quot; said Koch, who worked with Hildebrand on the Clinton and Gore campaigns. &quot;You're bringing two of the most talented Democratic operatives in the entire country into Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the latest Federal Election Commission reports from the end of August, Obama had raised $454 million and had $77 million on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, by contrast, had raised $210 million and had $27 million cash on hand. Obama raised a record $66 million in August alone and his campaign said it expected to match or exceed that in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans downplayed Obama's advertising barrage and his field organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Ballard, one of McCain's top fundraisers in Florida, said Obama's spending advantage will not necessarily translate into a Democratic victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you spend like a drunken sailor, it can give a false impression of a sound organization. Money covers a lot of flaws,&quot; said Ballard. &quot;We will see whether or not their organization is anything more than a dumping by the wheelbarrow full of money in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ballard and other Republicans point out their party's impressive track record of bringing voters to the polls and electing statewide candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Organizations are tested over time and I think the Republican organization has been tested in governor's races and Senate races,&quot; Ballard said. &quot;They will certainly outspend us. We're going to get our vote out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also signs that the Republicans are stepping up their efforts for the McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Charlie Crist will attend a &quot;grassroots rally&quot; for McCain and other GOP candidates in the state on Oct. 18 in Orlando. McCain is not scheduled to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist, whose popularity with Florida voters has weathered the economic downturn, toured the state with McCain late last month and with vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koch said Obama faces an &quot;uphill fight&quot; in a state that has only voted for two Democratic presidential candidates in the last 32 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he said, Obama's message of &quot;change,&quot; coupled with the state's economic problems, is resonating with the voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you talk about job losses, you talk about foreclosures, you talk about real estate problems, Florida is right there at the cusp of all the bad things that are happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of Florida are going to be looking for a new direction. And that's the challenge that each candidate has and that challenge breaks more favorably for Senator Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am writing in response to a letter to the editor from David White that criticized my comment that the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority does not have the funding to provide transportation for everyone to commute to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PSTA is primarily funded through ad valorem taxes (e.g., real property taxes). PSTA is operating under Amendment 1, just as all cities in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I did join the other 14 PSTA board members to approve a budget that reduced our capacity by approximately 5 percent. The budget process consisted of many months of review by PSTA staff, the PSTA Transit Advisory Committee (consisting of riders) and the PSTA board of directors. The increase in fuel costs, labor contracts and other operating expenses forced the PSTA board of directors to make difficult decisions on the use of our limited funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We focused route reductions on routes with fewer than five riders and many buses were often empty or carrying only a few riders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do not have the financial resources to operate $500,000 buses, driven by $60,000 bus operators, fueled with $4 per gallon diesel fuel and maintained at great expense, to carry one or two passengers paying $1.75 per trip (or less with passes). And, frankly, if we did have the funds, it is not a good use of our taxpayers' money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This rationalization of our bus routes will continue as our transportation system is fine tuned to provide maximum benefit to our citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. White would like to learn about the PSTA and public transportation, the PSTA board holds monthly public meetings that he would be welcome to attend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Library lovers pan closings story, Sept. 26</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employees need to pay health care</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is outrageous that the Clearwater City Council has decided to reduce the services of the city library system when one decisive move could eliminate all these library cuts. These cuts in service, and others, could be eliminated if the employees of the city - non-union and eventually union - started paying for their health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, as incredible as it sounds in this day and age, with city health care costs up 141 percent, an employee of the city pays nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a step that all taxpayers, not just the &quot;library lovers,&quot; should be demanding of our politicians, but unfortunately, the council lacks the courage to tackle the real budget problems of Clearwater.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Times' needs more balance letter, Oct. 8</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Times' stories are grotesquely biased</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I agree with Tarpon Springs resident Phyllis Heinly regarding her understanding of how the St. Petersburg Times reports news regarding the upcoming election. She states that the news media should remain neutral, yet she has noticed a definite bias toward the Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your reporting is grotesquely biased. In case you have not noticed, Florida is a &quot;swing&quot; state. We currently have more Obama/Biden supporters than McCain/Palin supporters. You could take your cue from that. It might increase your patronage to report more fairly. Readers such as Ms. Heinly and I would certainly appreciate your attempts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political watchers can recall that ACORN-bashing was quite common in Florida in 2004, when the group helped put a minimum wage measure on the ballot.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Democrat Barack Obama outspent Republican John McCain by more than 3-1 on TV advertisements in Florida last week, with Tampa representing his second-busiest target market for ads nationally, a study shows. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, the Wisconsin Advertising Project study of presidential campaign TV ads shows Obama and McCain spent a combined $28 million from Sept. 28 through Oct. 4, as both readied for the last month of campaigning. McCain and the Republican National Committee, which is helping to air pro-McCain ads, were outspent by Obama by $6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's other numbers from the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*$2.213 million: the amount the Obama campaign spent on ads aired in Florida, second only to his spending in Ohio ($2.218 million);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*$659,000: the amount the McCain campaign spent in Florida, sixth behind his amounts in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Six top markets for Obama ads: Las Vegas (1,288 airings); Tampa (1,069); Denver (1,059); Orlando (908); Milwaukee (832); Miami (824).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Six top markets for McCain ads: Denver (932); Las Vegas (712); Green Bay, Wis. (583); Cleveland (509); Milwaukee (490); Reno, Nev., (483).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's visit to Jacksonville on Tuesday boosted the GOP coffers by an estimated $1 million and had Democrats chasing her to Pensacola with a critical television ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cheers and chanting from a crowd of thousands rallying at The Jacksonville Landing was followed up by a $500-minimum-donation lunchtime gathering that drew hundreds of business people and elected officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a lot of excitement, a lot of money and a lot of people wanting to get onto the ticket,&quot; said Marty Fiorentino, a Florida finance co-chair for the John McCain-Palin campaign. &quot;I'm not exaggerating. It's going to bust $1 million.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, officials with Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign were studying Palin's speech at the Landing and devising plans to keep momentum in the battleground state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Mason-Dixon poll released Tuesday showed Obama ahead of McCain by 2 percentage points in Florida. Another poll, released Monday by Fox News and Rasmussen Reports, showed Obama ahead by 7 points statewide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerri Harvey, an independent from St. Augustine, said Palin's the reason she's leaning Republican this election. She went to the Landing bearing a placard that read: &quot;Palin Rocks. Women helping women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was undecided before she entered the race,&quot; the special education teacher and mother of four said. &quot;Now, I'm on fire over here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was one of an estimated 10,000 -- a crowd so large several thousand were unable to enter the rally area. They broke into chants ranging from the traditional &quot;U-S-A!&quot; to &quot;Drill, baby drill!&quot; as Palin talked about reducing dependency on foreign oil through renewable sources and, so long as it can be done safely, offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, Palin had to pause as the crowd began shouting, &quot;No-Bama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours, the Democrats were firing back. A 30-second advertisement titled &quot;Floridans Hurting&quot; was released to Northwest Florida television stations about the time Palin's plane was landing in Pensacola for the second of three campaign stops Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad flashes back to Sept. 15, when McCain told supporters in Jacksonville that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. Then, the narrator talks about job losses and foreclosures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not yield any part of the state because this election is too important,&quot; said Obama spokesman Kevin Cate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cate said the ad was combating the shots Palin took at Obama earlier Tuesday in Jacksonville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Obama represented taxes and &quot;America's dead end.&quot; That was the mild accusation, though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Landing, Palin pumped up the crowd alleging Obama has had a too-close-for-comfort relationship with Bill Ayers, a Vietnam activist linked to a group that protested by setting bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also framed Obama as unsupportive of the military, words that easily ruffle emotions in a town defined by its Navy and Coast Guard installations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an Obama campaign stop last month at Metropolitan Park, Obama spent more time talking about health care and the economy than he did the military, but he did say it was time veterans came home to better care, a sentiment that had thousands erupting into cheers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida is worth 27 electoral votes -- 10 percent of what a contender needs to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts have their eyes on Florida as a must-win for the GOP, especially after the McCain campaign disclosed it was pulling up stakes in Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's Democratic Party released figures Tuesday showing that the number of newly registered Democrats statewide since January outnumbers newly registered Republicans by 170,000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEST OF THE BLOG</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are some of the highlights of the Times-Union blog covering Sarah Palin's visit Tuesday to Jacksonville. To read it in its entirety, go to news.jacksonville.com/elections2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FIRST IN LINE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diane Cassaro of Southside Jacksonville is first in line here at The Jacksonville Landing. She arrived at 4 a.m., hoping only to get a good enough spot in line that she would be near the front once the rally starts. &quot;I was coming to be close enough so I would be able to see her without binoculars,&quot; Cassaro said. Now, she is hoping to shake Palin's hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROTESTERS DRAWING BIG ATTENTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though they walk in silence, about 20 or so pro-Barack Obama protesters are drawing lots of attention from the crowd of several hundred waiting in line for entry to The Landing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters, mostly from the AFL-CIO and Jax for Obama group, are carrying signs critical of John McCain, Palin and President Bush. Some signs have more general pro-middle class and pro-working class messages. There are a couple of Obama-Biden signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SPEECH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN ATTENDANCE: &quot;Are you guys skipping school today ... well, you give yourselves extra credit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE POLITICAL TICKETS: &quot;They look to the past because that's where they find blame. We look to the future because that is where we find solutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON MCCAIN'S LEADERSHIP: &quot;John McCain believes in our troops and in our mission, and as the mother of one of those troops, he's exactly the kind of man that I want as commander in chief.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON CHANGE: &quot;In politics there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers, and there are those leaders like John McCain who use their careers to promote change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON OBAMA'S PLANS: &quot;Barack Obama is going to raise your taxes. So there is a pattern here and that is with a left-wing agenda that is packaged to look very mainstream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TALE OF 2 CROWDS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's visit to Jacksonville could be described as a tale of two crowds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One rowdy, chanting slogans and waving signs; the other was more subdued, a sea of sport coats and fancy dresses. This is the crowd that donated at least $500 to see Palin speak at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium's West Touchdown Club. Councilmen Kevin Hyde and Bill Bishop were in the crowd, along with prominent business leaders. Mayor John Peyton, a Republican, is in Europe networking with Jacksonville Port Authority vendors and could not attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin spoke at the stadium for about 20 minutes before her motorcade loaded up to escort her to Jacksonville International Airport. Her speech was much the same as the public one she delivered earlier at The Jacksonville Landing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are stark differences between Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain -- except when it comes to their grass-roots campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From teens to retired seniors -- black, white and Hispanic -- each has amassed a cadre of volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns have four offices in Palm Beach County. In the Treasure Coast, McCain has two offices and Obama has one. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are neophytes such as Jefferson Paul, 14, of Delray Beach, who goes to the Obama campaign office every day after school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a guy I would love to look up to,&quot; says the Carver Middle School seventh-grader, who does everything from canvassing neighborhoods to sweeping the campaign office floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are seasoned helpers such as Silvio Perez, 70, who came to Florida from Cuba in 1960 and has worked in the campaigns of Presidents Richard Nixon and George W. Bush, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and other local Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think McCain, even though he is showing some age, is the candidate with the knowledge, and that is what we need,&quot; Perez says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perez is one of several members of the newly formed Palm Beach County chapter of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly, who recently attended their first meeting at McCain's campaign office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology has made it easier for candidates to get out their message nationally through Web sites, e-mail and text messaging, but at the grass-roots level it's still about personal contact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers spend hours calling registered voters. Others knock on doors, hoping a face-to-face chat will bring an undecided voter to their side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When people are really decided, it's very hard to change their mind,&quot; says Cynthia Kolb, who traveled from Sunrise to Boca Raton with her infant daughter to canvass for Obama in western neighborhoods. &quot;You really need to talk to the independents and undecideds, the people that are just looking for that one issue that's important to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Kolb, that issue is the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bank of America employee, she has been closely watching the financial markets and is terrified she may not have a job in six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is probably the most important time there will ever be in my generation to set the tone of what will happen in our nation,&quot; Kolb says. &quot;It's a really scary time. I don't see John McCain doing anything about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julie Scutti, a retired real estate agent who works the phones at McCain's West Palm Beach office, says her candidate will do something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel that John McCain is an elder in our society, and I feel that he has a good base and he has good integrity,&quot; says Scutti, of Palm Beach Gardens. &quot;I feel that he is a man that is very responsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's West Palm Beach office has a view of downtown and the Intracoastal Waterway. Obama's office is tucked in a small strip mall on the north end of Military Trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns are bringing in surrogates to excite the party faithful and draw newcomers, hosting registration drives and getting absentee ballots to voters. U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., was in West Palm Beach and Boca Raton on Monday to campaign for McCain; Obama has brought U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to Palm Beach County within the past month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in September, Obama's campaign, which has an office in Pahokee -- a first for a presidential candidate -- held events in West Palm Beach and Riviera Beach to encourage black residents to register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disc jockeys at both events blasted music to entice passersby. In West Palm Beach, they got free barbecue ribs and chicken for a few minutes of their time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man who goes only by the name Aziz stood in the road on Tamarind Avenue holding an Obama sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of the people down here are poor and unemployed. If they do have a job, they're making minimum wage. Historically, the Republican Party has never even looked over here,&quot; says Aziz, a warehouse employee who volunteers every day after work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need a true leader,&quot; he says. &quot;I think Barack Obama will actually get in office and become a true leader for this country and the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susana Diaz of West Palm Beach says the same about McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm on the moderate side of my party, and I really identify with him,&quot; says Diaz, whose 11-year-old daughter asked to come to McCain's campaign office to help work the phones. &quot;I also really like the choice of his vice presidential candidate. A woman that can wear that many hats can definitely help run a nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin on Tuesday wrapped up a two-day campaign swing through Florida attempting to tie Democrat Barack Obama to a 1960s radical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This election is about truthfulness and judgment needed in the next president,&quot; Palin said. &quot;John McCain has it, and Barack Obama does not have it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin ridiculed Obama for dismissing William Ayers as a &quot;neighbor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers, whose mention elicited one of the loudest &quot;boos&quot; from the Pensacola crowd, founded the anti-Vietnam group, Weather Underground, when Obama was a boy in the early '70s. Ayers participated in bombings of the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol during that period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a pattern here,&quot; Palin said. &quot;It's of a left-wing agenda packaged and prettied-up to look like mainstream policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign said Palin and Republican nominee John McCain are trying to use Ayers to divert attention from the nation's economic crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign sought to remind North Florida of the economic conditions in the state with an ad that points to the state's highest unemployment in a decade and mounting foreclosures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad shows McCain hugging President Bush and mocks the Arizona Republican for declaring &quot;the fundamentals of the economy are strong&quot; in Jacksonville last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin stopped in Jacksonville on Tuesday morning for a public rally and a fund-raiser before Pensacola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, she was in Clearwater and Estero before hosting an evening fund-raiser in Boca Raton that brought in an estimated $1.5 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pensacola, where McCain trained as a Navy pilot, Palin's fans packed the 8,100-seat Civic Center despite a daylong rain. Except for a strobe light, all the arena lights were turned off as Palin entered to the rock song Thunderstruck by AC/DC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Introduced by Gov. Charlie Crist, Palin touted school choice and an energy plan that depended on &quot;American energy resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She invoked former President Ronald Reagan and led the crowd in a chant of &quot;USA-USA-USA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't know anything about her when John McCain picked her,&quot; said Ed Shier, a 67-year-old Pensacola retiree. &quot;But when I saw her today, I melted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Palin will be depending on Shier and thousands like him in North Florida to help deliver the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The faithfully Republican stretch of Interstate 10 from the Panhandle to Jacksonville, which helped hand McCain a crucial victory in the presidential primary, can secure statewide elections for the GOP with strong turnouts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By WILLIAM MARCH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wmarch@tampatrib.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLEARWATER - Clearly feeling renewed confidence after her vice presidential debate with Joe Biden last week, Sarah Palin charged up an enthusiastic crowd with attacks on Barack Obama in a Clearwater rally Monday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin drove home the McCain campaign's most recent attack theme against Obama, his acquaintance with William Ayers, a professor who lives in his neighborhood who was a member of a violent, anti-Vietnam War group in the 1970s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans' pleasure with her debate performance against Biden was obvious, as warm-up speakers used the event for an applause line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah really did her job on Thursday night and brought it home ? now it's up to us,&quot; said Gov. Charlie Crist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin herself felt assured enough to joke about her previous, less-inspiring interview with Katie Couric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I shoulda told them I was just trying to keep Tina Fey in business,&quot; she said, referring to the comedian who does a blistering impression of her on &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Palin also acknowledged that McCain has become the &quot;underdog&quot; in the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political analysts and pollsters have been saying that for a couple of weeks as a result of the nation's economic crisis, but the McCain campaign has denied it. In a conference call Thursday, for example, top McCain strategists called Obama &quot;desperate&quot; and said McCain was close to a victory in Electoral College votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida knows a little something about turning an underdog into a victor,&quot; she said, referring to the Tampa Bay Rays. &quot;How about it, Florida, let us do that for Sen. John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fundraisers Part Of Tour</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearwater public safety officials estimated about 4,500 people crowded into Coachman Park downtown for the event, streaming in as early as 6 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That began a two-day tour with public appearances Monday in Estero and Jacksonville and today in Pensacola, plus private fundraisers in Naples, Jacksonville and Boca Raton expected to bring in $3 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money will go to the national Republican Party, which will use it to help the joint campaign/party efforts in battleground states, including Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin called her Couric interview &quot;a probably less-than-successful interview I had recently with kinda mainstream media,&quot; drawing boos from the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Really in that interview I was just getting really impatient because I was so convinced that Americans want to hear about the issues that are so important in your life,&quot; including the war, the economy and education, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She then accused Obama of being friends with Ayers, whom she called &quot;a former domestic terrorist who had targeted his own country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers, currently an education professor in Chicago, was a student radical in the 1960s and '70s involved in the Weather Underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, he held a campaign coffee for Obama, and the two have served on boards of charitable organizations together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has noted he was 8 when Ayers helped start the group, and his campaign says McCain is trying to divert attention from the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the financial crisis broadens the McCain campaign has decided it's got to change the subject,&quot; said former Florida Sen. Bob Graham on an Obama campaign conference call Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain Vows To Be Negative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign has said it intends to become more negative in the closing days of the race, and has released a TV ad criticizing Obama for his relationship with Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin used words like &quot;fearful&quot; and &quot;scared&quot; when talking about Obama - tapping another theme in recent McCain ads - and questioned his patriotism, accusing him of not supporting American military forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See, John McCain is a different kind of man - he believes in our troops and their mission,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin also took a political risk by bringing up her advocacy of Gulf oil exploration in a Gulf coast resort town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said &quot;untapped&quot; energy sources in Florida will be tapped, &quot;along with environmentally friendly offshore production. We do need to drill here and drill now. Now you can chant the 'drill, baby, drill,'&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, a warm-up speaker, had tried to incite the chant, popular among Republicans since their Minnesota convention, but in reference to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the crowd didn't seem to object to Palin's proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would all depend on where they put them [drilling rigs] exactly,&quot; said one attendee, Karen Hadley of Palm Harbor, who owns an engineering company with her husband. &quot;I don't think they would put them right on Clearwater Beach, so I'm not worried.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(CHART) BIDEN IN TOWN</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do either of the presidential candidates have a working knowledge of any language other than English?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama speaks only English. He picked up Bahasa as a child living in Indonesia and took some Spanish classes in high school and college, but he's not fluent in either. He does, however, agree that being bilingual is an asset and said earlier this year that every child in America should learn Spanish or some other foreign language. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain isn't fluent in any language besides English, though he can read some Spanish. He hasn't said much about foreign languages on the campaign trail, though he did sponsor a 2006 bill that offered illegal immigrants a path to eventual citizenship if they learned English, among other requirements. Obama, McCain's colleague in the Senate, supported that bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stepsons are from ex-wife</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have read that John McCain has stepsons. Is this true? Was Cindy married before?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is his party's candidate for president, has stepsons, but they are not Cindy's children, and she was not married before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's stepsons, Doug and Andy, were adopted by him after he married their mother, Carol Shepp, in 1965. (The couple later divorced.) Doug is a commercial airline pilot, and Andy is a business executive. Carol and John have a daughter, Sidney, together. John and Cindy McCain have four children and have been married since 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millionaires pack Congress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many millionaires are there in Congress? Who are the top five?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty-eight percent of the Senate and forty-four percent of the House of Representatives were millionaires in 2006, according to an analysis of the most recent year for which complete financial data are available by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. This compares with about 1 percent of all American adults. Senators had a median net worth of about $1.7-million. In the House of Representatives, the median net worth was about $675,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top five are Reps. Jane Harman, D-Calif.; Darrell Issa, R-Calif.; and Vernon Buchanan, R-Fla.; and Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass.; and Herb Kohl, D-Wis. Financial statements for 2007 can be viewed as they're submitted at www.opensecrets.org/pfds/index.php.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hair transplant is old news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wasn't Joe Biden in the news a while back for having a hair transplant? What is the story?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Sen. Joe Biden's hair transplants are old news. Reports of the Delaware Democrat doctoring his hair go back to the 1980s, but exactly how long ago he had the hair procedure has been his private secret. He refused to say when the Washington Post asked him in 1987.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rasmussen: &quot;Barack Obama has pulled ahead to his biggest lead yet over John McCain in Florida. The latest Fox News/Rasmussen Reports survey of the state finds the Democrat ahead 52% to 45%. With the release of the latest poll, Florida moves from &quot;Toss-Up&quot; to &quot;Leans Democrat&quot; ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest poll shows Obama dominating his opponent among unaffiliated voters in the state, 59% to 32%. McCain leads 54% to 43% among white voters in Florida, while Obama has a 67% to 33% lead among Hispanic voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;...While over a third (34%) of Florida voters say they would be extremely comfortable with Obama as president, just 27% say that of McCain. However, more voters (41%) say they would not be at all comfortable with Obama in the White House than McCain (37%). ... Florida voters are much more comfortable with Joe Biden than Sarah Palin for the Vice Presidency. While 38% say they would be extremely comfortable with Biden in office, 29% say that about Palin. Nearly half of voters (46%) say they would not be comfortable at all with Palin as VP, while just 28% say that about Biden.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a Barack Obama campaign conference call to criticize John McCain's health care plan, former Sen. Bob Graham reacted to Gov. Sarah Palin's attacks today on Obama's patriotism and association with Will Ayers: &quot;What we're seeing is that as the financial and economic crisis broadens in America and more and more people are directly effected, the McCain campaign has decided it's got to change the subject. They don't want to talk about why we got in this quagmire -- philosophy that Gov. Palin enunciated in the debate last week that what we need is less government, less regulation, more reliance on the free market. ... They're trying to shift the subject, but the American people are too smart to be misled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graham on McCain's health care proposal to move away from employer-based health care: &quot;This plan would be a disaster. It would cut Medicare and Medicaid by over 30 percent over the next 10 years, it would dramatically reduce the quality of health care for older Americans and the poorest and sickest Americans while at the same time adding to the burdens of state governments.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State planes too costly, new report says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by the Legislature's independent watchdog, OPPAGA, suggests a way the state can save money: Downsize the three state aircraft that fly officials around the state, outsource it to a cheaper private company, or fly commercial more often. (The report was well under way before Delta Air Lines announced that it was largely eliminating daily nonstop service from Tallahassee to other major Florida cities.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report was ordered by the Legislature last spring in response to concerns raised by, among others, Sen. J.D. Alexander, R-Lake Wales, who said it was hard to justify &quot;flying a bunch of politicians around&quot; at a time of cuts to programs like KidCare and aid to the disabled. During former Gov. Jeb Bush's tenure, the state agreed to pay $5.3-million for a Cessna Citation Bravo jet under a 15-year lease-purchase agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the OPPAGA recommendations (http://www.oppaga.state.fl.us/reports/pdf/0857rpt.pdf) were to be implemented, they would not affect the governor, Cabinet members, or legislative leaders, who are considered &quot;Priority 1&quot; users of the Cessna Citation Bravo jet and two King Air turboprops. The research unit was asked to look at only how to save money in ways affecting Priority 2 and 3 users, who are Supreme Court justices, state agency heads and other state employees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Barracuda tears into Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin lived up to her &quot;Barracuda&quot; nickname Monday morning in Clearwater (video here) (http://video.ap.org/v/Legacy.aspx?g=b09e03a3-4f23-4749-b25e-0c40ffc48561&amp;mk=en-ap&amp;f=flpet&amp;partner=en-ap), saying America can't afford Barack Obama's &quot;left-wing&quot; agenda and suggesting the Democrat is lying about his ties to a domestic terrorist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a pattern here of a left-wing agenda that's packaged and prettied up to look like Mainstream policies,'' Palin told thousands of cheering supporters in downtown Clearwater. &quot;Higher taxes and bigger government and activist courts and retreat in war -- that's not the right track for our country. That's another dead end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alaska governor joked about her &quot;probably-less-than-successful&quot; interview recently with Katie Couric. &quot;What I should have told them was I was just trying to keep Tina Fey in business,'' Palin quipped. &quot;Job security for SNL characters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also offered a shout out to the Tampa Bay Rays: &quot;Some of the experts this year were kind of tough on the Rays. I've been there,'' she said. &quot;Florida knows a little something about turning an underdog into a victor, and that's what we can do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the crowd that Obama is a defeatist on the Iraq war, suggested he did not support the troops in Afghanistan and said that no matter what he says he will raise people's taxes. She hammered Obama for his association with 1960s radical William Ayers, who in 1995 hosted a reception for Obama at his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama said Ayers was just someone in the neighborhood. But that's less than truthful,'' Palin said. &quot;His own top adviser said they were, quote, 'certainly friendly.' In fact, Obama held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers' living room. And they've worked together on various projects in Chicago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the 22-minute-speech, Shania Twain's She's Not Just Another Pretty Face cranked up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin hits Obama on Ayers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advance excerpts on Palin's Clearwater speech: &quot;Evidently, there's been a lot of interest in what I read lately. Well, I was reading my copy of the New York Times the other day&Eacute;and I was really interested to read about Barack's friends from Chicago. Turns out, one of his earliest supporters is a man named Bill Ayers. And according to the New York Times, he was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that, quote, 'launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow. And there's even more to the story. Barack Obama said Ayers was just someone in the neighborhood. But that's less than truthful. His own top adviser said they were, quote, 'certainly friendly.' In fact, Obama held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers' home. And they've worked together on various projects in Chicago. These are the same guys who think 'patriotism' is paying higher taxes. (Remember what his running mate Joe Biden said!) This is not a man who sees America as you and I do -- as the greatest force for good in the world. This is someone who sees America as 'imperfect enough' to work with a former domestic terrorist who targeted his own country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This, ladies and gentlemen, has nothing to do with the kind of change anyone can believe in -- not my kids and not your kids. What we believe in is what Ronald Reagan believed in! That America is 'a shining city on a hill for all mankind to see,' that America is a good and honorable nation &Eacute; and that the virtues of freedom are worth fighting for! The only man who can take on Washington is John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 5,000 people on the Clearwater waterfront cheered Gov. Charlie Crist moments ago while waiting for Sarah Palin. &quot;&quot;it's giddy-up time. We've got to get the action going...It's up to each and every one of you now, it really is. Sarah did her job on this night and brought it home. She is a great governor, she's one of us. She'll be a great vice president of the united states of America,'' said Crist, who also introduced his fianc&eacute; (&quot;Love ya, baby&quot;).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young relayed a story about being in Hawaii when John McCain returned from Vietnam after being a prisoner of war. He also used the examples of Golda Meir and Margaret Thatcher to say women like Sarah Palin are tough enough to lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis got the crowd going with chants of &quot;Drill, baby, drill!&quot; and &quot;Sarah! Sarah!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the first in line was Blair Skinner, 18, of Largo. &quot;I look up to her. She seems real cool,&quot; Skinner said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greer gets cold shoulder as Palin arrives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin arrives in Clearwater this morning for a blockbuster tour of Florida, she will be flying around with Gov. Charlie Crist, while scooping up campaign cash and enthusiasm for the Republican presidential ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's high-profile visit, her second to Florida, comes at a pivotal time. Polls show Democrat Barack Obama is now reaping a reward in the polls for having spent millions in advertising over the summer, and Florida Republicans have begun to question the strategy of Sen. John McCain's campaign in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an apparent sign of the tension between the state party and the McCain campaign, Florida Republican Party chairman Jim Greer is welcome to attend the events, as long as he makes his own travel arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he expects to participate in Palin events today but would get his own transportation. He has flown with McCain on recent visits and denied he was being shut out with Palin. &quot;This time,&quot; he said, &quot;I guess it's a smaller plane.&quot; (story here) (http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/state/article840494.ece)</SPAN></P>

And they've worked together on various projects in Chicago. These are the same guys who think 'patriotism' is paying higher taxes. (Remember what his running mate Joe Biden said!) This is not a man who sees America as you and I do -- as the greatest force for good in the world. This is someone who sees America as 'imperfect enough' to work with a former domestic terrorist who targeted his own country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This, ladies and gentlemen, has nothing to do with the kind of change anyone can believe in -- not my kids and not your kids. What we believe in is what Ronald Reagan believed in! That America is 'a shining city on a hill for all mankind to see,' that America is a good and honorable nation &Eacute; and that the virtues of freedom are worth fighting for! The only man who can take on Washington is John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 5,000 people on the Clearwater waterfront cheered Gov. Charlie Crist moments ago while waiting for Sarah Palin. &quot;&quot;it's giddy-up time. We've got to get the action going...It's up to each and every one of you now, it really is. Sarah did her job on this night and brought it home. She is a great governor, she's one of us. She'll be a great vice president of the united states of America,'' said Crist, who also introduced his fianc&eacute; (&quot;Love ya, baby&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UPDATE: Clearwater PD estimated 4,500 people attended, though local party says it was more like 10,000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearwater Mayor Frank Hibbard got things started about 7:15 a.m., followed by some music acts. After the national anthem, there was a parade of Pinellas County Republicans: Sheriff Jim Coats, St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Baker and U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young relayed a story about being in Hawaii when John McCain returned from Vietnam after being a prisoner of war. He also used the examples of Golda Meir and Margaret Thatcher to say women like Sarah Palin are tough enough to lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis got the crowd going with chants of &quot;Drill, baby, drill!&quot; and &quot;Sarah! Sarah!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Charlie Crist is expected soon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coachman Park in Clearwater is beginning to fill up early this morning in anticipation of Sarah Palin's speech. People began lining up outside the park as early as midnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the first in line was Blair Skinner, 18, of Largo. &quot;I look up to her. She seems real cool,&quot; Skinner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the sun is up, the park is rapidly filling with people decked out in red.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin arrives in Clearwater this morning for a blockbuster tour of Florida, she will be flying around with Gov. Charlie Crist, while scooping up campaign cash and enthusiasm for the Republican presidential ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's high-profile visit, her second to Florida, comes at a pivotal time. Polls show Democrat Barack Obama is now reaping a reward in the polls for having spent millions in advertising over the summer, and Florida Republicans have begun to question the strategy of Sen. John McCain's campaign in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an apparent sign of the tension between the state party and the McCain campaign, Florida Republican Party chairman Jim Greer is welcome to attend the events, as long as he makes his own travel arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he expects to participate in Palin events today but would get his own transportation. He has flown with McCain on recent visits and denied he was being shut out with Palin. &quot;This time,&quot; he said, &quot;I guess it's a smaller plane.&quot; (story here) (http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/state/article840494.ece)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second of a series of profiles of the vice presidential and presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Joe Biden took the dais Friday in Dover to send off a Delaware Army National Guard unit headed for Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In nearly four decades as a U.S. senator, the Delaware Democrat has spoken at dozens of departures. This one was different. His oldest son, Beau, is a captain in the unit preparing to deploy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stand strong,&quot; Biden told his son and the 114 other members of the 261st Signal Brigade. &quot;Come home to your families who love you.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming home safely to family is not something Joe Biden takes for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty six years ago, weeks after he won his Senate seat, Biden lost his wife and infant daughter in an automobile crash that critically injured Beau and his brother, Hunter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was sworn in, literally, at my bedside,&quot; recalled Beau Biden, who was 4 at the time. &quot;And he's never not been there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 36 years since then, Biden has remained at the side of his family, commuting from Wilmington to Washington, then returning each night after work by train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama tapped his Senate colleague Biden to be his running mate, the choice surprised some in the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Biden, after all, who nearly two years ago referred to Obama as &quot;the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy&quot; to seek the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that remark seemed patronizing, it didn't seem that way to Obama, who introduced Biden as &quot;one of the finest public servants of our time&quot; when he announced they would run as a team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the weeks since then, &quot;He's played the role he was assigned to play,&quot; said Darrell West, director of governance studies with the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. &quot;He's brought passion to the stump, he has delivered some tough messages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was part of Biden's mission Thursday, when he faced his Republican counterpart, Sarah Palin, in the vice presidential debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Biden's backers worried that he might stumble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He took on Palin only obliquely, if at all, mostly leveling his attacks at GOP nominee John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love him,&quot; Biden said of McCain. Personal views aside, though, said Biden, &quot;he's out of touch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar criticisms have been levied against Biden, who has a history of careless speech that recently led New York Times correspondent John Broder to label him &quot;a human verbal wrecking crew.&quot; As Broder wrote last month, &quot;A day on the campaign trail without a cringe-inducing gaffe is a rare blessing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In just the past few weeks, he's criticized as &quot;terrible&quot; an Obama campaign ad criticizing McCain for paltry computer skills; claimed to be Washington's first proponent of solar energy; and suggested that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., &quot;might have been a better pick than me&quot; to be Obama's running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a September interview, he told Katie Couric that &quot;when the stock market crashed, Franklin Roosevelt got on television and ... said, 'Look, here's what happened.'&quot; Roosevelt wasn't president during the market crash of 1929, and television wasn't introduced until the next decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, 65, was born in Scranton, Pa., the son of a car salesman. Ten years later the family moved to the outskirts of Wilmington, where Biden was raised in a working class Roman Catholic community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He overcame a childhood stutter that had led classmates to taunt him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1977, still reeling from the loss of his wife and daughter five years before, Biden married his wife, Jill, an English professor. They have a grown daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His first presidential bid came to an end in August, 1987, after Biden quoted from a speech written by British Labour Party Leader Neil Kinnock. He'd quoted from the speech before, attributing the passage to Kinnock, but did not do so in a speech before the Iowa State Fair. Political writers tagged him a plagiarist, the label stuck, and Biden bowed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just screwed up,&quot; Biden explained last year on the David Letterman Show. &quot;It was a flat mistake on my part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden returned to Washington. There, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he led the Democratic fight to defeat President Ronald Reagan's Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden suffered a brain aneurysm in 1988 so serious that last rites were performed before surgery corrected the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2002, Biden was one of 77 senators who voted to authorize President Bush to go to war against Iraq. More than five years later, with 4,177 U.S. troops killed in Iraq and 30,680 wounded, Biden has joined Obama in vowing to end the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the debate, Biden was restrained except for once. That was when he followed up on a passage from Palin in which she mentioned her own son, who is serving in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, like so many times before in his career, it was to his bond with family, and the tragedy they've known, that Biden turned as a point of reference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand what it's like,&quot; he said, briefly choking up, &quot;to wonder what it's like if your kid's going to make it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheerleading for drilling is new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's headline-making speech in June in which he made a pitch for lifting a federal moratorium on offshore drilling, drew some opponents to say McCain reversed his position on the federal ban. But McCain's record is not so clear. About the closest we could come to finding an inconsistency in McCain's position was two newspaper articles from the presidential race in 1999 - one from the San Francisco Chronicle, the other from the Ventura County (Calif.) Star - in which reporters paraphrase McCain's position as supporting the moratorium on offshore drilling. In 2000, the Associated Press listed McCain's position on offshore drilling as &quot;Supports state wishes over federal fiat in oil drilling.&quot; But nowhere in those interviews or in speeches prior to Houston does McCain actively advocate for states to permit offshore drilling. Nor does he talk about creating incentives to encourage them to do it, as he did in June. That's why the speech made for front-page headlines. Yes, McCain has long been in favor of letting states ultimately decide whether to drill, but he's now become a cheerleader for the cause. If it's not a change in position, it's at least a change in posture. So we rate McCain's position a Half Flip. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More compromise than change of heart</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Chicago in June, Obama was unequivocal about his opposition to offshore drilling off Florida's coast. &quot;And when I am president, I will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off Florida's coasts,&quot; Obama said. He said McCain's proposal to lift a moratorium on offshore drilling &quot;will only worsen our addiction to oil and put off needed investments in clean, renewable energy.&quot; But then in August, Obama gave his support to a bipartisan energy plan that would allow offshore drilling within 50 miles of the Florida coast. Asked whether his support for the plan was a flip-flop, Obama said that he remained highly skeptical about drilling off Florida's coast but that big steps toward energy independence may require compromise: &quot;If we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise, in which I have to accept some things I don't like and the Democrats have to accept some things they don't like, when it's actually moving us in the direction of energy independence, I'm open to that.&quot; Obama hasn't sounded like someone who has changed his mind on the issue, so much as someone willing to consider swallowing some offshore drilling as a compromise to get other energy initiatives he really wants. So we rule it a Half Flip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There isn't any juice behind this claim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Obama opposes innovation, the electric car and &quot;clean, safe, nuclear energy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, June 25 in a Web ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's take electric cars first. To back this up, the McCain campaign cites Obama's statement that McCain's $300-million prize for improving car batteries was &quot;a gimmick.&quot; But that doesn't prove Obama said &quot;no&quot; to electric cars. In fact, Obama has said his energy plan will lead to more electric cars. In a speech on June 16, Obama said his proposal to invest $150-billion in energy programs would lead to new jobs &quot;that will be created when plug-in hybrids or electric cars start rolling off the assembly line here in Michigan.&quot; That doesn't sound like &quot;no&quot; to us. Against innovation? An 11-page account of Obama's plan includes incentives for communities to invest in biofuels refineries, more emphasis on clean coal and &quot;safe and secure nuclear energy.&quot; That sounds to us like a pretty significant attempt at innovation. Which brings us to the McCain&nbsp;ad's last point, that Obama said &quot;No To Clean, Safe, Nuclear Energy.&quot; To the contrary, it's right there on page 4 of Obama's energy plan: &quot;Safe and Secure Nuclear Energy.&quot; So McCain is way, way off with these charges. He has completely distorted Obama's positions. It's so wrong we have to set the meter ablaze: Pants on Fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has a mixed record</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Aug. 28, in a speech to the Democratic National Convention in Denver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Congress passed the first increase in fuel-efficiency standards in decades. McCain missed the final vote in December 2007 and missed other votes in June. In 2005 and in 2003, McCain voted against an amendment that would have increased fuel-economy standards on a set timetable. At the time of the 2005 vote, McCain declared himself a supporter of higher standards. The Obama campaign also points to McCain's vote against a 2002 energy bill that would have directed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to set new standards for Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE). But that was a watered-down version of a bill that would have increased the standards through legislation. McCain was one of just six Republicans who voted no, but he and Democrat John Kerry were the driving forces behind the tougher language. Obama makes it sound as though McCain opposed raising fuel-economy standards for cars, and there are votes to support that claim. But in 2002, McCain wanted tougher standards than most of the Senate did. Obama gives a misleading picture of a senator who has been a notable advocate of higher standards. We rate this Barely True.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their past positions and their plans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- An &quot;all of the above&quot; approach that favors expanded offshore drilling and encourages other domestic sources, including natural gas, clean coal and nuclear power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Opposes new taxes on oil companies such as a windfall profits tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Sets a goal for 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030, with an ultimate goal of 100 nuclear power plants. Supports the Yucca Mountain project to store nuclear waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Supports a cap-and-trade mechanism that would set a limit on greenhouse gas emissions and allow companies to buy and sell rights to emit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Earlier this year, favored suspending federal gas taxes as a way of helping consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Urges $150-billion in public investment to accelerate clean energy such as electric cars, clean coal, renewable fuels and upgrading the nation's electricity grid. This initiative would result in 5-million new jobs, Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Opposes expanded offshore drilling in principle, but would accept it as part of comprehensive energy legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Says nuclear power should be part of the domestic energy supply, but opposes the Yucca Mountain project to store nuclear waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Supports a cap-and-trade mechanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Opposed a gas tax holiday. Favored a windfall profits tax on oil companies to provide &quot;energy rebate&quot; to the public.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama has pulled ahead of Republican John McCain in three Florida polls released Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Quinnipiac University poll shows Obama with a 51 percent to 43 percent lead. McCain had a seven-point advantage in a Quinnipiac poll in early September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new CNN/Time poll gives Obama a 51 percent to 47 percent lead in Florida. And an InsiderAdvantage/Poll Position survey shows Obama within a 49 percent to 46 percent edge. Those leads are within the margin of error for each poll. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, an Associated Press-GfK poll showed Obama has surged to a seven-point lead over McCain. Likely voters now back Obama 48 percent to 41 percent over McCain, a dramatic shift from an AP-GfK survey that gave the Republican a slight edge nearly three weeks ago, before Wall Street collapsed and sent ripples across worldwide markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has consistently led in most Florida polls throughout the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Quinnipiac poll suggests that economic concerns have driven many Florida voters to Obama. That poll also finds declining approval ratings for Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, who is scheduled to visit Boca Raton for a fund-raiser next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is difficult to find a modern competitive presidential race that has swung so dramatically, so quickly and so sharply this late in the campaign,&quot; said Peter Brown, assistant director of Quinnipiac's Polling Institute. He was referring to the Florida poll and Quinnipiac surveys released Wednesday that show Obama expanding his leads in Ohio and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain has his work cut out for him if he is to win the presidency, and there does not appear to be a role model for such a comeback in the last half century,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 21 Florida polls recorded by RealClearPolitics.com between Aug. 1 and last week, McCain led in 16, Obama led in two and three showed the state tied. In seven polls compiled by the political Web site this week, Obama leads in four, McCain leads in two and one shows a tie. RealClearPolitics recently switched its evaluation of Florida from &quot;leaning McCain&quot; to &quot;toss-up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new CNN/Time poll conducted by Opinion Research Corp. sampled 770 likely Florida voters Sunday through Tuesday and has a margin of error of 3.5 percent. That means each candidate's percentage could be 3.5 points higher or lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That poll shows Obama leading 51 percent to 47 percent in a head-to-head match-up with McCain. When minor-party candidates Bob Barr, Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader are added to the survey question, Obama remains at 51 percent and McCain's percentage dips to 43 percent, with Nader attracting 3 percent. Liberal consumer advocate Nader is usually seen as taking votes from the Democratic nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quinnipiac's latest Florida poll of 836 likely voters was conducted Saturday through Monday and has a margin of error of 3.4 percent. In that poll, independent voters prefer Obama by a 52 percent to 40 percent margin in Florida. McCain led 50 percent to 43 percent among independents in Quinnipiac's previous poll, taken Sept. 5-9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida women voters, who narrowly favored McCain in the early-September Quinnipiac poll, back Obama 57 percent to 37 percent in the new survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an early September Quinnipiac poll, Palin was viewed favorably by 47 percent of Floridians and unfavorably by 23 percent. Her favorable/unfavorable score was 42/36 in polling Quinnipiac did Sept. 22-26. But in the poll taken Saturday through Monday, Palin's favorable rating slipped to 36 percent and her unfavorable score rose to 39 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic concerns are playing to Obama's advantage in Florida, where 61 percent of voters say the economy is the most important issue. Asked who they trust more to handle economic issues, 50 percent of Floridians say Obama and 40 percent say McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $700 billion economic bailout plan before Congress is opposed by 42 percent of Floridians and supported by 36 percent, with Republicans generally supportive of the measure and Democrats and independent voters opposed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is how interminable presidential elections have become.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember Eisenhower and then these two guys. They've taken away all my memories,&quot; the comedian-actor and host of Comedy Central's &quot;Root of All Evil&quot; says from his New York home, just days before his show Friday night at the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall in Sarasota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he packs for a brief trip to Aruba, he shares his thoughts on the election and other things. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There must be a lot of fodder for jokes with this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There really is, but it's exhausting, because they don't really talk about what they're supposed to talk about anymore. They just talk about what they say the other person said was wrong about what they said. Well, that doesn't help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do you think of Sarah Palin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people call it McCain's 'Hail Mary.' There's like 1 second in the game and you're going to fire a 90-yard touchdown pass. If it works, he'll look like a genius.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this what is really getting your blood boiling these days?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, this and drilling for oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You're coming to Florida -- a perfect place to bring that up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Go ahead and drill, idiots. Then you're not even going to get the money. Good move. You put yourself in jeopardy; just check what happened up in Alaska with the Valdez and how long it took to get that money and they didn't even get the money they set out to get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You think this is going to make oil cheaper? It's not going to make it cheaper. It's nuts. And I don't really care, because by the time they get the oil and get it for your cars, I'll be dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We even export oil. Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because it would be silly to keep it. To keep that price, you've got to make sure oil companies make their money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I love is, you elect two guys that are big in oil, and all the oil companies make huge profits. There's no correlation -- really, none? C'mon. Meanwhile, we invade Iraq, which has oil but we don't get any of that. We shouldn't have said we were invading; we should've said we were just drilling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do you think of Florida?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like Los Angeles. When I'm in Los Angeles, I think it looks like Florida, but it's not. Florida is wild, but I couldn't live there. The humidity breaks me. I don't know how you guys do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've never been a big water person. When I sit on the beach and I'm looking out at the water, all I see is a possible ear infection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why then are you going to Aruba?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You'll be the first to know. I'm doing commercials for Aruba Travel. That's why they hired me, it's me being miserable among all these happy people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK, what does Aruba have that Florida doesn't?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, apparently it doesn't get hit by hurricanes. I don't know what else, but I'll find out when I get there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says that under his tax plan, seniors making less than $50,000 per year won't pay any income taxes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Tuesday in a TV ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new 2-minute TV ad, Barack Obama explains his economic plans and contrasts them with John McCain's. He says in the ad that &quot;seniors making less than $50,000, who are struggling with the rising costs of food and drugs on fixed incomes, won't pay income taxes at all.&quot; That is correct. Obama's tax plan specifies that he would &quot;eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than $50,000 per year.&quot; The campaign estimates it will cut taxes an average of $1,400 for 7-million seniors. It's worth noting that Obama's proposal has been criticized on several fronts. Some economists have questioned whether it's a wise policy because seniors already receive favorable tax treatment. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax research group, said Obama's plan would create inequity by eliminating taxes for senior citizens who earn a modest income but continuing to tax younger workers earning the same amount. Also, it would help seniors who are currently paying income taxes but provide no benefit for those too poor to owe any tax. Still, Obama accurately describes his plan in the ad. We rate his statement True.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, Washington was at its worst Monday when it needed to be at its best. In a remarkable repudiation of President Bush by members of his own party, the House rejected the administration's bailout and sent more shudders through the fragile economy. Now it is the responsibility of members of both parties who rejected the proposal to be constructive rather than destructive, because doing nothing is not an option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look at the immediate fallout. The Dow dropped nearly 780 points, the largest single-day drop ever. Do you have a 401(k) retirement account or an IRA with mutual funds tied to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index? It dropped more than 8 percent. There were indications the tight credit markets were becoming even tighter, making it harder for businesses and financial institutions to borrow money. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a crisis that extends beyond Wall Street to Main Street companies that need to make payrolls, homeowners who can't buy or sell their houses and parents who need to borrow money to pay for college for their kids. Even before the House vote, the Federal Reserve and central banks in other countries made billions available to banks having trouble raising money. Federal regulators forced the sale of Wachovia, the largest bank in Florida and hard-hit by the mortgage crisis, to Citigroup. This is not a situation that will correct itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush administration's $700-billion plan is nothing to celebrate. Nobody wants to see such a stunning amount of public money allocated to propping up private banks and investment firms by purchasing bad mortgages and other troubled assets. No one wants to see taxpayers suffer for the lack of regulatory oversight by the federal government and the greed of investment firms whose executives made unimaginable amounts of money. But now is the time to calm the financial system and avoid an economic collapse that would affect every American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's U.S. House members were divided on the bailout - and not entirely along partisan or ideological lines. In the Tampa Bay area, only Rep. Adam Putnam, R-Bartow, a member of Republican leadership, voted for the bill. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, voted against it and argued it did not do enough for middle-class families. Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite, R-Brooksville, called it &quot;extortion'' in her usual unhelpful, over-the-top rhetoric. Even the measured Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Indian Shores, hardly a hard-line conservative, voted against it. He believed the proposal was rushed and other solutions were not considered beyond Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's outline. When a Republican administration loses a moderate like Young on a defining economic vote, it needs a better plan or a better sales pitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's vote was a colossal defeat for Bush, as 133 House Republicans deserted him. Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee who made a show of rushing back to Washington to help negotiate a plan, does not look so good, either. He took credit Monday morning for helping seal the deal, although he had little input. By Monday afternoon, he was blaming Sen. Barack Obama and House Democrats for derailing the bill with partisan comments. That's not leadership; that's covering up his own ineffectiveness with members of his own party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush and his economic advisers labeled this a historic crisis and offered a historic solution. They did not close the sale with most Americans, and fellow Republicans in the House embarrassed them. Now it is up to the president to craft a plan that will win broader support - and do it quickly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Stan Mayfield, a Vero Beach Republican who was just elected Indian River County tax collector, has died of cancer. He was 52.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is with great sadness that I inform you that our friend and colleague has passed away,&quot; House Speaker Marco Rubio announced moments ago. &quot;He was surrounded by family and friends. I will notify each of you of funeral arrangements as soon as they are finalized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayfield represented District 80, which includes parts of Brevard, Indian River and St. Lucie counties. He was chairman of the Environmental &amp; Natural Resources Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was a professional engineer and a general contractor. He had owned Mayfield Group Construction of Vero Beach. He is survived by his wife Deborah and sons Evan, Samuel and Coleman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in March 2007, was treated and returned to office, looking remarkably vibrant. But things turned for the worse recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, Mayfield beat GOP Chairwoman Carole Jean Jordan in the Republican Party primary to replace Indian River County Tax Collector Charles Sembler. There was no Democrat, so Mayfield was elected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All's quiet in the FL House (except this tidbit)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who did Bob Ward tick off?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one, perhaps. But the chief of staff to outgoing House Speaker Marco Rubio is spending the summer on the 12th floor of the Capitol, not his usual 4th floor digs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effectively replacing Ward this summer is Rep. Marty Bowen, the speaker pro tem. The Haines City Republican has been working out of Rubio's office, handing day-to-day business, an unorthodox role but one that fits in her job description, said House spokeswoman Jill Chamberlin. She is not being paid more than her regular legislative salary, Chamberlin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is widely thought that Ward will become the hybrid clerk-parliamentarian in November. Clerk Bo Pittman and parliamentarian (and close Rubio friend) Leonard Collins have already been told they are no longer needed (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/2008/07/sansom-quietly.html), creating tension as one speaker leaves and another takes over.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sink: We don't like it but we need the bailout</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink said it was &quot;very disappointing&quot; that Congress failed to pass the bailout on Monday during a press conference on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buzz asked Sink about whether she would have voted for the bailout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody likes the legislation. Nobody likes everything it it,&quot; Sink said. &quot;But given what the administration started with, which was 'just give us a blank check for $750-billion dollars,' it ended up certainly not being that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They scaled back the dollar amount. There has to be accountability in there. And we have to get these markets stable, otherwise we're going to be in a really, really serious situation,&quot; Sink said. &quot;They've got to come back on Thursday with a plan that's going to stabilize the markets and open up credit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've got to come back on Thursday and do the responsible thing for our country and pass that bill,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CFO Alex Sink has put together a task force to look into changes to annuities laws, with an eye toward safeguarding seniors from fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, she had pushed for legislation, read about it here (http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/article462184.ece), that would have increased penalties on companies that coerce seniors into buying financial products that they don't need nor want. (Like annuities that cost thousands of dollars if you try to collect before 20 years is up.) She got some strengthened penalties, but she didn't get it deemed a felony. She blamed Met Life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said I wasn't gong to quit &Eacute; and we're coming back to stories like these about how their constituents are being impacted,&quot; Sink said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task force will look into fraud cases and suggest more legislative changes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Charlie Crist spoke with Senators Bill Nelson and Mel Martinez this morning to get an update on the financial crisis but Crist declined to say which way he thinks Congress should go on the $700-billion bailout to prop up the markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure. They need to vote their conscience, first and foremost,&quot; Crist said. &quot;I think what has to happen ... they need to work in a bipartisan fashion, whatever it is, to do what's right for the American people. ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's make sure we all work together. And do what's right in the best interest of the people,&quot; Crist said. &quot;There are those who argue you have to do this bailout deal in order to make sure you continue to have funds available to people. And others are concerned that the result of the bailout is that you are rewarding those who caused the problem in the first place. It's a difficult, dicey situation. &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Sheldon wins permanent DCF post</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Sheldon, the interim secretary of the Department of Children and Families, officially got the job Tuesday, as predicted (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/2008/08/crist-sheldon-m.html) earlier on The Buzz. The 61-year-old lawyer and longtime Tampa resident was DCF's assistant secretary for operations since February 2007, and he has been an associate dean at St. Thomas University in Miami, working alongside his longtime associate and predecessor at DCF, Bob Butterworth. Sheldon, a Democrat, served four terms in the state House (1974-1982) when he ran unsuccessfully for Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His priorities at DCF will include preventative measures to help weed out abuse cases by looking at drug treatment and intervention, and getting more families on food stamps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a great irony in Crist's selection of Sheldon for this key state post. Back in 2000, Sheldon ran unsuccessfully against Crist in the last race for the elected post of education commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a harsh campaign, with Crist briefly running a TV spot that questioned Sheldon's fitness to hold office, based on Sheldon's then-16-year-old DUI arrest and his support, as a legislator, for a bill to keep first-time marijuana users out of jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist quickly pulled the ad, which surfaced at the same time as George W. Bush's own 1976 DUI in Maine. Reflecting on his decision to run the ad, Crist said Tuesday: &quot;In life, the older you get, hopefully the more mature you get.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATLANTA -- There might be fewer yard signs and commercials for a technical-sounding constitutional amendment than for the campaigns of Barack Obama, John McCain and congressional candidates, but its impact could still be significant on the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both those for and against Amendment 3 agree that the ballot measure could have a broad effect on the future of Georgia, either by sparking development in forgotten corners of the state or by giving developers unprecedented power to build no-risk subdivisions and retirement communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the three proposed amendments going to voters in November -- the others deal with forestland preservation and special tax districts often used for urban revitalization -- the last one is perhaps the most controversial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For proponents, all three measures work together, giving rural and urban areas a way to draw increased business activities while still making sure the state has natural beauty in reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters will have a unique opportunity this November to help jump-start our economy while protecting our environment,&quot; said George Israel, president and CEO of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, which is coordinating joint efforts on the three measures. &quot;The combination of these three ballot initiatives means thousands of new jobs and billions of dollars in investment across our state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists, though, are hoping to break the coalition when it comes to Amendment 3 dealing with &quot;infrastructure development districts,&quot; which critics call &quot;private cities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Except for the people that stand to benefit from it, nobody really wants it,&quot; said Neill Herring, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question might be whether anyone is paying attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRIVATE CITIES?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters say infrastructure development districts, or IDDs, are little more than a new way of financing the installation of water and sewer systems, roads and other amenities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the main selling points: The measure would help draw developers to more remote areas of the state by making sure the projects can be supported without further burdening taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essentially, a developer could use fees charged to homeowners to finance infrastructure bonds, saving cities and counties the cost of piping water to a development or paving roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Instead of the existing taxpayers in the community having to come up with the ability to pay for that new infrastructure or for the improved infrastructure, it basically allows for that debt to be paid off by all the new users of that infrastructure,&quot; said Heath Garrett, strategist for the pro-amendment Georgians for Quality Economic Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garrett said the districts, each of which would require local government approval, would allow for careful planning and guarantee environmental safeguards. The measure requires 20 percent of any development to be green space and bars septic tanks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the third in a series of stories looking at the 2008 presidential race through the lens of residents of unique Florida communities. The first, on The Villages in Central Florida, and the second, on Little Havana in Miami, are available at heraldtribune.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama will not find too many supporters at the bar at the American Veterans Post 7 in this small town in the middle of Florida's Panhandle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This country would go down the tubes if they put him in there,&quot; said Ron Noss, 64, a Vietnam veteran and the canteen manager for the local veterans' organization. &quot;We need a veteran in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Noss used a racial epithet when first asked about the presidential campaign, he and other bar patrons insisted race was not the issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have nothing against a black man running for president,&quot; said a man sitting at the bar who declined to identify himself. &quot;I think that's great if it's the right black man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exchange at the veterans' bar in Washington County represents the political challenges that Obama faces in the Florida Panhandle, a largely rural, conservative bastion that once played a dominant role in state politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Florida's most influential politicians in the 20th century came from the region, including Senate President Dempsey Barron of Panama City, Gov. Reubin Askew of Pensacola and Gov. LeRoy Collins of Tallahassee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the rest of Florida grew, the region's influence has waned. Yet the Panhandle, which has only 8 percent of the state's population, still fiercely holds on to its political heritage, claiming three House speakers since 1993, including Rep. Ray Sansom, R-Destin, who will become the new House leader in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats outnumber Republicans in the region. But many of them are very conservative voters, favoring local Democrats for county commissioners and sheriffs but preferring Republicans in statewide and national races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidates, like Obama, generally do not run well in the Panhandle outside of the Democrat-leaning Tallahassee area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, John Kerry won only three of the 16 Panhandle counties that stretch from Jefferson County, east of Tallahassee, to Escambia, Florida's most western county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President George W. Bush carried more than 71 percent of the vote in Washington County, the site of the AMVET post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Mason-Dixon poll conducted in mid-September showed Republican John McCain leading Obama in North Florida by an 18 percent margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of factors tilt the Panhandle toward more conservative candidates in national elections. The region has a half-dozen military bases -- including the Naval Air Station at Pensacola and Eglin Air Force Base near Fort Walton Beach -- and a large population of former veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Panhandle residents more often than not reflect stronger &quot;Old South&quot; values than the rest of the state. Here sentiments run strong for religion, gun rights and anti-abortion efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that is not to say the Panhandle is monolithic and unchanging. While there are smaller rural counties like Liberty, which is Florida's least populated county, there has been a growth boom along the coast in places like Panama City, Destin and the coastal communities between Fort Walton Beach and Pensacola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Panhandle also includes Florida's only black-majority county -- Gadsden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while it has small towns with funky names like Two Egg and Sopchoppy, the Panhandle also boasts tonier addresses in places like Seaside, an upscale beachfront community in Walton County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Florida heads toward another presidential election, a reporter and photographer took a 275-mile journey through the heart of the Panhandle last week, traveling through nine counties and stopping in more than a half-dozen communities, ranging from rural towns a little more than 10 miles south of the Alabama border to Gulf-front cities facing new development pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panhandle voters share a common trait with the rest of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are very worried about the national economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington County, home to the annual Possum Festival in Wausau, Sheriff Bobby Haddock, a conservative Democrat who is running for re-election, said the economy is &quot;on the minds of a lot of people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know who they are going to blame,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haddock has a good sense of the voters since he uses a time-honored campaign technique in the Panhandle -- going door to door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm seeing a lot of people out of jobs,&quot; he said. &quot;They're suffering and hurting right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic woes are also being felt in Apalachicola, a proud commercial fishing town that harvests 90 percent of Florida's annual oyster crop. The town and nearby St. George Island are attracting new development, including condominiums and pricey shops and restaurants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still dealing with the ongoing fight with Georgia over the water flow in the Apalachicola River, Walter Ward, who has spent some 35 years in the seafood industry, said his shrimp operation is struggling with the high cost of diesel fuel. Right now, Ward, 50, said most of his five shrimp boats are in port because of the fuel costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's slow with the fuel prices,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward said he is likely to vote for McCain &quot;because of Sarah Palin,&quot; his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think she would make a better president than both of them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 22 miles down U.S. 98 is Port St. Joe, where residents still feel the loss of a major pulp and paper mill 10 years ago that cost the town some of its highest-paying jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irene Acree, owner of Cooper's Cut &amp; Style hair salon, said the town has not been the same since the mill closed and the national economic slump is adding to the woes. She now rides her bike to work, partly for health reasons and partly because of the high price of gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acree said she will vote for McCain because he has successfully faced adversity in his lifetime, including his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's stepped up to the plate in times that have needed him,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acree, 50, is skeptical of Obama, although she said he is &quot;probably a good fellow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want change,&quot; she said. &quot;But I don't know what that guy is going to change. I do know he believes in socialized medicine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest city between Tallahassee and Pensacola is Panama City, where a major airport is being built that will have a widespread impact throughout the Panhandle. The area has also seen a building boom on nearby Panama City Beach, where small hotels and shops that once epitomized the &quot;Redneck Riviera&quot; are being replaced by multistoried condominiums looking out onto the glittering waters of the Gulf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But eating breakfast at Cassandra's Place in downtown Panama City, Bob Dallas said the economic slowdown has brought his work as a mortgage broker &quot;almost to a halt.&quot; He said it is difficult to obtain appraisals in a chaotic real estate market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dallas, a veteran who was wounded in a mortar attack in Vietnam, said he has registered to vote for the first time since he returned from the war and he is supporting Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to vote for Obama and I've been a diehard Republican for most of my life,&quot; the 66-year-old said. &quot;I know if we get McCain in, it's going to be more of the same -- it's not going to change anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another breakfast diner, Linda Long, 60, said she likes McCain and Palin enough to vote for a Republican for the first time, having supported Kerry in the last election. With a son in the Army who has done two tours in Iraq, she said McCain's military background and experience will help bring the war to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the boys have to come home,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Holmes County fair in Bonifay, Bob Jones, the county's Republican chairman, joked he had not seen anyone all week handing out campaign literature in the Obama booth at the fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think John McCain and Sarah Palin will do very, very good here,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting on a bench in the fairgrounds with his daughter, Martin Andrews of Ponce de Leon said he was voting for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just feel like he would be a better leader right now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling the economy a &quot;pretty bad mess,&quot; Andrews, 56, who works at the Vortex Springs diving resort, said the nation's leaders need to do something about the sky-high fuel costs, saying it is hurting all parts of the local economy from truck drivers to farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are going to start getting hungry pretty soon if something doesn't change,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heading east on U.S. 90, the main east-west interior highway in the Panhandle before the construction of I-10, is Marianna, a town just south of the Florida Caverns, the only state park in Florida that offers cave tours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking for a deal at the Christ Town Bargain Center on the east side of the city, William Walters, 70, a retired state worker, said he was likely to vote for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife, Deanne, who cannot vote because she is a British citizen, said the couple supports Obama because he is more likely to change the policies of the Bush administration, including bringing the Iraq war to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deanne Walters also said Obama could face opposition in the Panhandle because of his race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's still very prejudiced,&quot; she said. &quot;But it's undercover now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody says much openly. But that will go against him a lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the breakfast diner in Panama City, one man seemed to reflect the angry mood of an electorate buffeted by an economic meltdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, who declined to identify himself, said he was not going to vote for either McCain or Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Neither one is worth a damn,&quot; he said. &quot;The economy stinks. Everything stinks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his Sunday column (&quot;The secret cell helping McCain&quot;) Randy Schultz does an interesting job of jousting with a vapor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I, along with perhaps millions of others, saw this riveting documentary -- Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West -- about two years ago when I knew little of Barack Obama and didn't care much about John McCain. So now I am supposed to believe that this DVD recently was sent out to some of the most populous regions in the country, which is where I surely would send it, that it is being used as a tool by &quot;cowards&quot; to target Sen. Obama because he has an Arabic middle name? What a completely marginal theory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who exactly is it that is planting &quot;clear ideas&quot; here? And how is this an ad campaign for Sen. McCain? As to the Clarion Fund, there is no mention of politics at all on its Web site or on any of its links, except a nonpolitical general call to vote posted on the radicalislam.org Web site. The strongest charge the group seems to hold is that the &quot;mainstream media is not adequately conveying the reality of radical Islam.&quot; Wow. There's a news flash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mainstream folks simply ignore the evidence that is so well-documented on the DVD. I also found that there are more spook journalism stories out on the Internet about the intent of this mailing, so Mr. Schultz can feel secure in his theory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems to me that The Post has knocked down a straw man.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASILLA, ALASKA </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a teenager in this small town 30 miles outside of Anchorage, Sarah Heath Palin was known as an athletic tomboy with a lively sense of humor and easygoing personality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics and supporters of Palin agree that her personable style and ability to communicate with voters has played a huge role in her swift rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her ability to connect with people is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen,&quot; said Jim Whitaker, the Republican mayor of the Fairbanks North Star Borough, who is backing Barack Obama for president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as governor, there are accusations that she let vendettas mix with her politics and had trouble trusting anyone not seen as loyal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin, 44, now is embroiled in an investigation into whether she abused her power when she fired her public safety commissioner. Palin's spokesman insists she has done nothing wrong. But she has backed down from cooperating with the legislative body conducting the investigation, saying partisan Democrats are running it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin grew up hunting, fishing and snowmobiling. She was a high school basketball standout -- earning the nickname Sarah Barracuda for her aggressive play -- and a beauty pageant queen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is the mother of five children with her husband, Todd, a commercial fisherman and oil field worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wasilla is part of what has been referred to as the Bible Belt of Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin has said her faith has shaped many of the socially conservative views now invigorating the Republican Party's religious right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She is a strong Christian,&quot; said Judy Patrick, who served on the Wasilla City Council during Palin's terms as mayor and attends the governor's church. &quot;For us, it is about a relationship you have with God, as opposed to a religious choice that you might tick off on a questionnaire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her first campaign for mayor of Wasilla in 1996, Palin said she would change the direction of government. But her anti-abortion views polarized the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Palin won she asked for resignation letters from the city's department heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics accused her of being vindictive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They accused us of staging a coup, and some of the most vocal opponents got really mean-spirited about the whole thing,&quot; Patrick said. &quot;She got elected on a platform of change, and in order to carry out that change, she needed to get people on a team that were working for change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin lost a 2002 bid for lieutenant governor. In 2003, then-Gov. Frank Murkowski appointed her to Alaska's energy commission. The next year, Palin filed a complaint against a fellow member of the commission, who was also the head of the state Republican Party. The commissioner admitted wrongdoing and paid a $12,000 fine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2006, Palin began her campaign for governor with the promise to clean up state politics. She promised to take on the oil industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a relatively unknown candidate, Palin beat the unpopular Murkowski in the Republican primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She won because she wasn't Frank,&quot; said Larry Persily, who worked for Palin's Washington office. Persily was a newspaper columnist in Anchorage during Palin's gubernatorial race. &quot;Frank was seen as arrogant and secretive. She was approachable and open. The public was really just bowled over by her, the press included.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's approval ratings soared to more than 80 percent during her first six months. Bloggers soon began suggesting her as the Republican vice presidential pick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin got two of her biggest priorities passed in the legislature -- ethics rule changes and her much-anticipated natural gas pipeline bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic lawmakers said she worked closely with them on rewriting the oil tax bill that drives more than a third of the state's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her talent is following power and knowing where that power is,&quot; said Rep. Beth Kerttula, a Democrat from Juneau and the House minority leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to record-high oil prices, Alaska's coffers have seen unprecedented surpluses. Still, Palin angered lawmakers by slashing $230 million out of the state budget without a clear explanation of what she had prioritized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor was not communicating well with lawmakers on the budget, Rep. Kevin Meyer, a Republican from Anchorage, told reporters at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin has been criticized for spending little time in Juneau, seldom coming to the state capital except when the legislature was in session. In Wasilla, huge McCain-Palin signs with &quot;Go Sarah!&quot; dot the highway that runs through town. But some residents have grown tired of the media that have inundated the locals since August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's childhood home is now a thrift store. Workers there say reporters keep showing up to ask whether Palin ever stops by to shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd just like for us to go back to being a quiet little town,&quot; said Agnes Emerson. &quot;I'm tired of all the attention.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPRINGFIELD, Ill. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;As the bicentennial of his birth nears, he's almost more legend than man. Get to know the real Honest Abe.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a dank, stony hallway beneath a towering obelisk, I stand in the reverent shadows of the innermost part of Lincoln's Tomb, as close to the president's remains as any person can be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here lay also the bodies of his wife and three sons who died before manhood, part of a family scarred by personal tragedy, yet marked by public triumph. From Lincoln's humble log cabin beginnings he rose to become the 16th and perhaps greatest president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while we can get this close to the body, how near can we come to the man? As the bicentennial of his birthday approaches in February, many people will go on this quest in search of Lincoln. And as we prepare to vote for a new president, many will study Lincoln to discern the qualities of a great leader - and to decide which current candidate measures up best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mile and a half away in downtown Springfield, I set out to find the man at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. More than 1.6-million visitors have come since it opened three years ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike any other presidential museum, it is revolutionary, controversial and successful. Designed by former Disney Imagineers in consultation with historians, it blends a Disney aesthetic with a serious purpose true to history. Its multiple layers allow people to approach it in different ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wanted to connect the head and heart in the way people connect to the story,&quot; said Tom Schwartz, the Illinois state historian. &quot;When people walk through that (exit) door, they need to be changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are. Here's how it works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visitors enter a rotunda where they see lifesize, realistic models of the Lincolns and can pose for pictures. From there, it's best to prepare for the museum by watching Lincoln's Eyes, a rapid-fire multimedia affair. Scrims rise and fall in staccato succession, projecting images and voices telling the story of Lincoln's life. Seats shake and lights flash. Remember, Disney is involved. There's even a cannon boom signaling the start of the Civil War - the only weapon in evidence throughout the museum. It's a good set-up to the rest of the visit. As the narrator says, &quot;Each of us might see part of ourselves in Lincoln's eyes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The museum is divided into two &quot;journeys,&quot; first, the formative years leading to the White House, followed by the Civil War presidency. The sum effect is to keep Lincoln complicated and contradictory, yet whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man of contradictions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lincoln was born in Kentucky, but the first exhibit shows a representation of a cabin that the young Lincoln would have lived in after his family moved to Indiana. Attention to detail is everywhere. Inside the cramped cabin young Abe reads by the dying embers as the rest of the household sleeps. The sounds are so realistic that when we first visited the museum last year, our guide dog puppy quietly woofed at the sounds of Joe, the dog resting beneath Lincoln's feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Move from there to a slave family being separated at the auction block. At the museum's &quot;soft&quot; opening, the state historian said, a colleague's young daughter didn't really understand slavery but fully realized the look of anguish on the faces of the mother and child. That, he said, was how the museum tries to reach people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enter the next room and see the New Salem store of 1833 that Lincoln co-owned, which failed. At the Lincoln-Herndon law office, see a very unmuseum-like display in the incredible mess of Lincoln's work arrangements. Nearby, Lincoln's young boys giggle and use inkwells for a ball and a broom for a bat. Ink splatters stain the walls throughout the office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That room sums up the contradictions of Lincoln, disorganized yet hardworking and principled. &quot;He liked law, and he was very good at it,&quot; said Schwartz. People often fail to grasp &quot;his enormous capacity for work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibits flesh out Lincoln the man, an ambitious, adroit politician yet a flawed, fallible human being who suffered from melancholy, and maybe depression. Nonetheless he would become a great statesman even though he held only one national office - two years in the U.S. House - before the presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One exhibit puts the 1860 election into perspective. You're in a television control room as the late Tim Russert recaps the 1860 presidential stakes. Each of the four candidates' slogans becomes clear when their political ad appears on TV: Lincoln for union, Stephen Douglas for popular sovereignty, John Breckenridge for property and states' rights, and John Bell for compromise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a clever way to convey the cacophony of the 1860 election and to crystallize the issues in a few minutes of watching TV monitors. Funny are the crawls across the bottom of the screen with breaking news about Louis Pasteur and his experiments with germs, the Pony Express and a repeating rifle called the Winchester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a risky exhibit to try. &quot;It was a judgment call,&quot; said Schwartz. &quot;And I had to make it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In consultation with master teachers, Schwartz knew that schoolchildren fully understand that TV didn't exist in antebellum America but that they have a hard time grasping the milieu of 1860 politics. This anachronism is obvious enough to work effectively. And it's a great way to remind people that more people voted against Lincoln than for him in 1860.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics and war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now begins the second journey, the White House years. Rather than a dull chronological narrative, the museum skips through time, hitting major themes. It takes you through the White House kitchen, a smart way to hear the voices and opinions and gossip of African-Americans as well as to see what happened behind the scenes at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small touches of realism abound. The stove is hot to the touch (hot water is pumped through it). Rather than recount every moment of White House strategy, the exhibit opens on to the Cabinet meeting where Lincoln announces to his rivals that he will issue an Emancipation Proclamation. Rather than the famous dignified engraving (now at the Smithsonian) by Alexander Hay Ritchie of a seated Cabinet drinking in the news, this lifelike tableau shows men raging as well as ecstatic, with placards explaining each man's position on abolition and attitude toward the proclamation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turn down a hallway tunnel and hear a riot of voices as floating heads yell their divergent views as you pass. It's hard to leave that hall without feeling, as well as understanding, the sense of disharmony that had settled upon the country. End at a wizened Lincoln standing over a desk, documents at his hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leave there, and understand the true cost of war. See a mural of the black regiment whose fight was commemorated in the movie Glory, and then slip into a gallery that depicts the Civil War and its casualties in four minutes. On a big screen, one week passes in a second as a ticker counts the casualties for the North and South. Booms ring out as battle names appear on the screen and the battle lines move back and forth until Sherman's March to the Sea turns most of the map into Union colors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Move down the hall and come to Ford's Theater, and see John Wilkes Booth slowly opening the door to the president's box. And then, the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's body lies in state in a closed coffin draped in black. The museum bent history a bit here. In reality, the casket was open. That same little girl who was so disturbed by the slave auction was unsettled by the casket. &quot;I don't like this,&quot; she told her mother. &quot;Let's go.&quot; The state historian defended this slight distortion: &quot;Can you imagine what that would have been like had she seen a face?&quot; He added: &quot;We felt we might be creeping people out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artifacts of a life</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At many points along the way, historians have compiled a reading list of great books for those whose appetite has been whetted to learn more. There are many references to other places to see the spot where the history occurred, from the battlefields of Gettysburg to where Lincoln was born in Kentucky to spots around Springfield - the one house he ever owned, the old Capitol and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the street at the library - the collection of papers and documents doesn't circulate but is accessible to the public - Schwartz took me down into the vault where more than 1,600 Lincoln artifacts are kept. I held a cuff link Lincoln wore the night he was assassinated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The historian opened a box and showed me Lincoln's beaverskin stovepipe hat - long, soft indentations evident from where his fingers grasped the hat to doff it, and the inner band stretched from holding important papers. I also held a telegram Lincoln had written by hand to Gen. George McClellan, who had complained that his horses were too sick for the army to attack. The short note shows Lincoln's wit, his steely will and his exasperation with a general reluctant to fight. &quot;Washington, D.C., Oct. 24, 1862. Majr. Genl. McClellan, I have just read your despatch about sore tongued and fatigued horses. Will you pardon me for asking what the horses of your army have done since the Battle of Antietam that fatigue anything? (signed) A. Lincoln.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those physical objects felt almost mystical, like touching greatness. Yet the museum does a better job than those mementos - which aren't now on public display - of making Lincoln real. On one wall is a photographic enlargement showing Lincoln's Tomb, and the outsized bust of the president in front of it, its nose polished by the constant rubbing of passers-by. In the photo as in real life, the nose has been rubbed - and that part of the picture worn through - by visitors treating it as the real thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's the glory of the museum. It makes Lincoln real. You begin to understand a man whose grandfather was shot dead in an Indian raid, who grew up teaching himself to read, who gained the respect of men close to him even as he became the most hated man in America. A man who, though he had already delivered the Gettysburg Address and signed the Emancipation Proclamation, might have lost his re-election bid in 1864 had his generals not started winning, including the burning of Atlanta. He died mere months later, at the height of his popularity, his legend set to grow. The museum brings that legend down to earth and makes the man available to us mere mortals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lincoln's influence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential nominees John McCain and Barack Obama have ties to Abraham Lincoln or to Illinois, the Land of Lincoln. As we entered the museum, I asked Illinois state historian Tom Schwartz which part of the museum he would take them to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For McCain, nominee of the party of Lincoln, the historian walked me to a mural of the war and then to the gallery showing the casualties, &quot;the Civil War in four minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The military aspect of the Civil War exacted a large cost in American blood and treasure,&quot; Schwartz explained. &quot;As a decorated veteran from the Vietnam War, Sen. McCain fought to preserve some larger ideals. Lincoln fought the Civil War to preserve Union and larger ideals that he felt America uniquely represented. As president, how would he compare his ideals to Lincoln's?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Obama, senator from Lincoln's state of Illinois, Schwartz took me to the auction of the slave family. &quot;Slavery and its elimination is one of the main story lines in the museum,&quot; the historian said. &quot;If Sen. Obama is elected president, his administration will correspond with the 150th anniversary of the Civil War. How (or would) the commemoration of the Civil War be used to advance racial healing in this county?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As long as the race is close come Election Day, Barack Obama should win Florida thanks to soaring supporter enthusiasm and a vast get-out-the-vote operation. So says Steve Schale, Florida director for the Obama campaign, who appears on Political Connections on Bay News 9 today at 11 a.m. and 8 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what area of Florida will he be watching closest as the returns come in? &quot;Places like Pasco and Pinellas - this bay area. So goes the bay area, so goes Florida,&quot; said Schale, who was also asked about Sarah Palin's effect on swing voters in places like the Tampa Bay area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The McCain campaign threw a Hail Mary, and in the short term it was a completed pass. The question is whether or not she can run with the ball. We'll have to see. She's got some tough questions she'll have to answer, she has to go through the debate, she's got to come on Political Connections and answer the tough questions,&quot; said Schale, sucking up to his interviewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jewish vote worries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not a Florida-specific poll, but it points to a problem for Obama in Florida: A new national poll of 914 Jewish voters commissioned by the American Jewish Congress shows Obama receiving 57 percent support and John McCain 30 percent (54 percent disapproved of the Palin pick, and 73 percent approved of Joe Biden as a running mate). Remember that in 2004 Bush received 24 percent of the Jewish vote nationally and 20 percent in Florida, according to exit polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mind you, only about 5 percent of the Florida electorate is Jewish. But that's still about 400,000 voters, and serious slippage in the Democratic base makes it all that much harder for Obama to make up that 380,000-vote margin by which Republicans won Florida four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respect Rosh Hashana</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, Bill Clinton is concerned about the Jewish vote too. He had been expected to campaign for Obama in Florida Monday, but the ex-president told Larry King last week that he won't campaign during Jewish holidays. Rosh Hashana runs Monday through Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, they think that because of who I am and where my political base has traditionally been, they may want me to go sort of hustle up what Lawton Chiles used to call the 'Cracker vote' there,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;But Sen. Obama also has a big stake in doing well in the Jewish community in Florida, where Hillary did very well and where I did very well. And I just think respecting the holidays is a good thing to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter registration flood continues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state Division of Elections is scrambling to process the flood of new voter registration forms. The state, which a few years ago took over responsibility for managing Florida's voter database, wants already swamped supervisors to handle some of the work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oct. 6 is the deadline to registering for this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking issue with the Times</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Plouffe, Obama's national campaign manager, took a little shot at us Saturday over a St. Petersburg Times story a couple weeks ago suggesting Florida could be slipping away from Obama. The latest polls show a neck-and-neck race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're seeing today that Florida could not be more competitive,&quot; Plouffe said. &quot;We think we've really strengthened in Florida, we have a strong base in Florida. And so what McCain was hoping would be a state that may not be a central battleground is a central battleground. We feel very optimistic about our prospects in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff writer Steve Bousquet contributed to this week's Buzz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winner of the week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Janet Long, D-Seminole, the winner, had a target on her back after narrowly defeating Dottie Reeder in 2006 for the House District 51 seat. But Republicans made a mess of trying to unseat her, pushing aside Bruce Cotton in favor of Terry Sanchez, who dropped from the race last week unexpectedly. GOP leaders tapped lifeguard Christopher Peters, 26, to step in, though his name won't even be on the ballot. Votes for Sanchez will go to Peters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Loser of the week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Tom Feeney, R-Oviedo, was embroiled in scandal five years ago after crooked lobbyist Jack Abramoff flew him to Scotland on a golf junket. He's worried it will hurt his prospects. In his newest campaign ad, he apologizes for &quot;rookie mistakes.&quot; Feeney, as a former Florida House speaker, was not exactly a political rookie when he took that trip.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANALYSTS QUESTION HIS LATEST MOVES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By WILLIAM MARCH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tampa Tribune</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA - A &quot;maverick&quot;? Or just &quot;erratic&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bold, independent and principled? Or impetuous and desperate to shake up a race as his opponent moves up in the polls?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You could hear both descriptions of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the aftermath of the first presidential debate Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no clear consensus among political analysts on who won the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another question is how and why it almost failed to happen, and what it says about a candidate given to doing the unexpected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, McCain delivered his second campaign shocker in less than a month, announcing a suspension of his campaign and asking to delay the debate. He said he planned to head for Washington and dive into the contentious can of worms over a financial industry bailout bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That followed his unorthodox and unexpected choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate in late August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been other surprises:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*His suggestion to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*An unconventional ad campaign, and a series of some of the most slashing, widely condemned, negative ads ever in presidential races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Last summer's wholesale reshuffling of his then-failing campaign, including firing his closest, longest-tenured adviser, David Weaver, to gamble his race on a bid to win the New Hampshire primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list could go on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a pattern,&quot; said University of South Florida political scientist Susan MacManus, of &quot;unpredictability&quot; and a tendency to shake up the race when things look gloomy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of the Palin pick, it clearly worked, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was totally unexpected, announced at a time when people were focused on the [Illinois Sen. Barack] Obama campaign and a lot of Republicans were despondent about an unexciting ticket,&quot; MacManus said. &quot;She brought his campaign back to life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the case of the maneuvering around the debate, McCain's bold move may not have been quite so successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacManus thinks it &quot;didn't really give him a huge boost, but didn't really hurt him either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain Move Upped Ante</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates clearly wanted to put their own stamp on the solution to the Wall Street crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the debate, Obama initially pursued a joint statement by the rivals of principles supporting a bailout bill - a move that potentially could make him appear to be the statesman seeking a bipartisan solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain upped the ante by announcing a suspension of campaigning and seeking a delay of the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's backers say that demonstrated his &quot;country-first&quot; principles. &quot;He is willing to risk [the] election to do what's right for the country,&quot; said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama supporters called it a ploy to change the shape of the race, in which Obama was moving into the lead in national polls, and the national focus on the economy, on which polls say voters trust Obama more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe called McCain's campaign &quot;erratic,&quot; and said his approach to the bailout bill &quot;is clearly not about principle, it's about politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailout Accounts Differ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's latest shake-and-bake move came after about 24 hours of backstage dealings between the two, including conflicting proposals to work together on the bailout bill, at the instigation of Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, a longtime ally of McCain and a friend of both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he started the dialogue with McCain based on a suggestion Tuesday night from Coburn. Obama wanted to issue a joint statement emphasizing features he and McCain agree should be in a bill - eventual repayment of tax money, limits on chief executive pay and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after talking to Obama on Wednesday - and, Obama says, agreeing to a joint statement - McCain pre-empted the discussion with a televised statement that he was suspending his campaign and seeking a delay in the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their accounts of a key phone call Wednesday afternoon differ - Obama says McCain agreed to the joint statement, but McCain says he asked Obama to go to Washington with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To many, that leaves their motives uncertain as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It isn't either all purity or all self-interest on the part of either,&quot; said presidential politics specialist Bruce Buchanan of the University of Texas. &quot;I think you see a little bit of both in both candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Buchanan said, McCain's political style was a disadvantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His honest instinct to get in there and do something - where it's obvious to anyone there's not a great lot he can do - invites the perception that this is grandstanding,&quot; Buchanan said. &quot;I think he does honestly have these impetuous desires to rush forth and be a leader, but it's also a way to grab the advantage back in an area where he's losing ground. It's a little bit desperate, and may have cemented the theory that he's too impetuous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(CHART) LEADING UP TO THE DEBATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rough chronology of John McCain's and Barack Obama's negotiations concerning the bailout bill and the debate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday evening</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, calls both candidates - not immediately reaching either - to suggest they &quot;rise above politics and work together to help resolve the financial crisis,&quot; said Coburn spokesman John Hart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hart said Coburn suggested no particular course of action, only that they work together, and that Obama was the first to call back. The two discussed a joint statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday, 8:30 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama calls McCain to suggest a joint statement that would emphasize areas where he and McCain agree on a bailout bill - eventual repayment of tax money, limits on CEO pay and others - but doesn't reach him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign says Obama didn't leave a message giving the subject of the call, and that despite the calls from both Coburn and Obama, McCain didn't know what the call was about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday, midday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain delays calling Obama back while he meets with economic advisers and calls congressional leaders, according to a statement from his campaign. He also meets with Lady Lynn De Rothschild, a former Clinton backer who recently came over to his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday, about 2:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain reaches Obama at Knology Park in Dunedin, where Obama has just finished speaking at a rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said McCain agreed to his suggestion for a joint statement, but also suggested a meeting in Washington with the congressional leaders and the president, and delaying the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought this was something that he was mulling over,&quot; Obama told reporters later Wednesday afternoon. He said he responded that the two should issue the joint statement first &quot;to send a signal to the members of Congress,&quot; and discuss the other ideas later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday, about 3:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time Obama's motorcade reaches the Belleview Biltmore in Clearwater, where he was staying for debate prep, McCain has issued his statement on suspending his campaign and calling for a debate delay, but does not mention a joint McCain/Obama statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his statement, McCain gives a different description from Obama of their conversation an hour earlier: &quot;Tomorrow morning, I will suspend my campaign and return to Washington ? I have spoken to Senator Obama and informed him of my decision and have asked him to join me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain does not immediately return to Washington, despite having said in his statement it was urgent to reach a consensus before the markets open Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday night</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joint statement is issued, but it doesn't mention any areas of agreement on the bailout bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday morning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain goes to Washington.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOSEPH H. BROWN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's only September and I'm already sick of the political ads on TV. If you listen to any of them, no one running for office is worthy of the position they seek. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I blow most of them off, but one ad by the McCain campaign really got to me. It said that Barack Obama and the Democrats would raise our taxes and increase government spending. That might happen, but they would have to go a long way to top what Republicans did when they controlled both the White House and Congress between 2001 and 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After winning the White House and Congress in the 2000 election, Republicans did follow President Bush's lead and aggressively slashed taxes. John McCain supported most of these cuts but opposed many others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I digress. While Republicans ranted against big-government liberal Democrats to get elected, once they gained power they abandoned their role as the party of limited government and fiscal restraint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big Government Conservatism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 2001 and 2007 - the year Republicans lost their congressional majority after being trounced in the 2006 election - federal discretionary spending swelled 40 percent after inflation, from $762 billion to $1.067 trillion. Even subtracting defense and homeland security, spending accelerated 27 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush and most Congressional Republicans enacted the 2002 farm bill (cost: $190 billion), the 2003 Medicare drug entitlement ($783 billion through 2018; $8.4 trillion through 2082), and 2005's highway bill ($286 billion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Citizens Against Government Waste, a government watchdog group, calculates pork barrel projects ballooned from 4,326 earmarks worth $17.7 billion in 2000, under Democrats, to 9,963 worth $29 billion in 2006, under Republicans. (Earmarks peaked at 13,997 in 2005.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George W. Bush could have shown some leadership as the budget deficits mounted, but during his first term he became the first president since John Quincy Adams, in the 1820s, to go a full term without a veto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We Need Spending Cuts Too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his tax cuts passed, Bush spoke of being &quot;good stewards of taxpayers' dollars&quot; and predicted the federal budget deficit would be cut in half in five years because of the economic growth the cuts would generate. But if government spending isn't reined in, that's just wishful thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milton Friedman, the conservative Nobel laureate in economics, said years ago, a tax cut isn't a tax cut unless it's accompanied by a spending reduction. It's simply a deferred tax increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in July, the White House reported a projection for a $482 billion budget deficit for the budget year ending in September 2009, a number that would be the highest number recorded. That was before the $700 billion financial bailout package the president and Treasury secretary requested. The Democrats haven't helped, but Republicans didn't either when they were in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now is not the time for finger-pointing; it's time for solutions, not party-bashing for votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because as this decade has shown, an appetite for pork is a bipartisan disorder.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After another crazy week in the presidential campaign, we now know for sure that John McCain's passion for gambling extends well beyond occasional trips to casinos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it's at the craps table he's known to frequent or on the campaign trail, McCain is a gut player who relishes high-stakes risk-taking. If not for his solid debate performance Friday night, the Arizona senator might have derailed his entire campaign last week with his roll-of-the-dice announcement that he was suspending his campaign and seeking to delay the first presidential debate so he could help negotiate a financial bailout package in the works on Capitol Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More here. On Thursday we should see the next installment of the Sarah Palin gamble. &quot;Mostly vice presidential debates don't matter, but the Palin-Biden debate will be as important a debate as we had Friday,'' said Republican strategist George LeMieux of Fort Lauderdale. &quot;I don't think Joe Biden is going to factor much into the debate. It's going to be Sarah Palin vs. (moderator) Gwen Ifill.&quot; </SPAN></P>

In his newest campaign ad, he apologizes for &quot;rookie mistakes.&quot; Feeney, as a former Florida House speaker, was not exactly a political rookie when he took that trip.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ouch. Methinks Barack Obama national campaign manager David Plouffe just took a little shot at me for this story a couple weeks back suggesting Florida could be slipping away from Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would be remiss if I didn't comment on the the story of a couple weeks ago that suggested a lot of Republicans down there...were feeling more comfortable about Florida,'' Plouffe said on a conference call. &quot;We're seeing today that Florida could not be more competitive. We think we've really strengthened in Florida, we have a strong base in Florida. And so what McCain was hoping would be a state that may not be a central battleground is a cenral battleground. we feel very optimistic about our prospects in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TALLAHASSEE -- Thousands of fired-up Barack Obama supporters, many of them college students, filled the quadrangle on the campus of Florida A&amp;M University Saturday for a voter registration rally co-starring Michelle Obama and Jill Biden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ticking off problems like a &quot;broken&quot; health care system, failing schools, high fuel and food costs and the cost of the war in Iraq, she asked the crowd: &quot;Isn't it time that we have new solutions, that we put the old ways aside? Shouldn't we have leaders who get it?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we contemplate bankrolling the federal government's $1-trillion bailout of bad mortgages, feel free to take a crack at the financial idiot savants who fumbled this disaster into our hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when we've gotten that out of our system, time to rain a few blows on ourselves. Wall Street may have been pushing these toxic loans, but Floridians were among the biggest abusers of these house-of-cards real estate deals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain &quot;has opposed stem cell research.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama, in a radio advertisement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain and Obama campaigns released competing radio ads on the issue of embryonic stem cell research. In one, McCain touts his record of support, in the other Obama criticizes McCain's record of opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can they both be right? Not really. It's true McCain once opposed the research, and back in 2000 he joined 19 other senators in asking the National Institutes of Health to withdraw new proposals to fund federal embryonic-cell research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the following year, McCain changed his mind. In a television interview he said: &quot;I've looked at the issue more carefully. I have talked with numerous scientific experts. ... I think it's an issue that I was educated on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, McCain has stood in favor of such research, much to the chagrin of many of his Republican colleagues. While it's true that his choice for vice president, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, opposes embryonic stem cell research, she has made it clear that her &quot;personal opinion&quot; on the issue wouldn't stand in the way of the policy of a McCain administration. Obama's got this one wrong.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Protecting Marriage Protects Our Children&quot; (Other Views, Sept. 24):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Blankenhorn's opinion piece argues that same-sex marriage should not be allowed because &quot;people wed primarily to reproduce.&quot; That argument is deeply flawed. Many people who wed are unable or unwilling to have children. We view the marriage of a 50-something woman to be just as valid as that of a woman of childbearing years, and we do not deny a man's marriage license because he has had a vasectomy. Those marriages are socially accepted and they do not affect family units or its children. The existence of same-sex marriages makes no difference on how individuals relate to their own spouse or raise their own children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been totally amazed that Christine Jennings has been so astonished that there were fewer votes cast in her race against Vern Buchanan. She thinks that the votes were lost or stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My opinion is that many people like me were so disgusted with the negative ads by both candidates that we decided not to vote for either candidate. That is exactly what I did with my ballot. I left it blank. I will probably do the same thing this year as the same negativity is still there.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enough is enough. Quit the bashing and tell us what you would like to get done if elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember, a president has to try and get something through Congress. Give us your ideas for a solution. Remember some of you are still on the government payroll and are still working for the people. There used to be a law, &quot;truth in advertising,&quot; and I wish it applied to politicians. If there is a poor turn out, you may be the cause of it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This past weekend I was discussing the upcoming presidential election with an acquaintance. When I expressed my support for Obama, this lovely old Southern woman, a lifelong Democrat, exclaimed that she was not going to vote for &quot;no zebra.&quot; She went on to tell me that not only didn't she like Obama, but she didn't like his wife or his children either. She wore her bigotry like a badge of honor. That conversation filled my heart with sadness. What is wrong with people?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These words were spoken by a woman who professes to be a Christian. I tried to share my point of view with her, but she was incapable of hearing my words. She regurgitated all sorts of misinformation and innuendo perpetrated by certain mainstream media as well as circulated via the Internet. So, if Mr. Obama doesn't win this presidential election, it won't be because he wasn't the better man.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barak Obama is biracial. He is viewed in the United States as running as the &quot;black&quot; candidate. If he were running for office in an African country, would he be viewed as the &quot;white&quot; candidate?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bias Against Lawyers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I tell people I'm not voting for Obama, they ask if I'm prejudiced. I am. It's not, however, racial prejudice; it's prejudice against lawyers. I think there are far too many lawyers in Washington and since Obama is a lawyer, plus his inexperience, and views on several important issues, I can't see voting for him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What kind of example is Todd Palin making in refusing to testify? Alaskans citizens and U.S. voters aren't good enough to hear his testimony? Did he get a &quot;Don't Snitch&quot; T-shirt somewhere?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether he believes this investigation is &quot;legitimate&quot; is not his call. A subpoena is a court order requiring a person to appear in a legal arena &quot;under punishment&quot; to voice the witnesses' testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously, something is amiss, and his refusal to testify speaks much louder than whatever the outcome may be.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding McCain's decision to bring &quot;the huntress&quot; into his camp:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This know-nothing, know-it-all is acting as if she were going for the White house, not Blair house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If she really cared for the good of the country she would have declined. If she cannot keep her own house in order how can she presume to go to Washington - in any capacity?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am a white female, senior-citizen mother and career woman, so I know the challenges. A woman can go through a million glass ceilings. If her family and children's needs are not met, she has accomplished nothing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dems' Diversionary Tactic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me understand; panicked liberals shriek that Sarah Palin lacks the qualifications to be &quot;a heartbeat from the presidency,&quot; yet obsessively support a man who is arguably the least-qualified person in history to be president. His r&eacute;sum&eacute; and experience completely lack substance or credibility. This is the pinnacle of partisan hypocrisy placing party and power over country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks on Palin (personal and professional) are standard political tactics designed to divert attention from Obama's total absence of leadership qualifications. Diversions are how magicians create illusions, not how the United States should elect leaders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tampa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qualification Questions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selection of Sarah Palin as Republican VP nominee just reinforces the disgust so many Americans have with the whole process. To the players it is about trying to attain power through clever cat-and-mouse games, to one-up the opponent though the guise of finding the desperate change so many want in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has become obvious that the incumbent party may lose this election because we have very serious economic/international problems. After badgering the Democratic nominee for his inexperience, we have a VP nominee a heartbeat away that is a nothing more than a glorified county commissioner of a large U.S. state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even a junior U.S. senator has full exposure to national and international issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why else would 200,000 Germans show up to hear Obama?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this small town, Wednesday was a once-in-a-lifetime day as Barack Obama spoke at Knology Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the stadium's walls, we met protesters arguing passionately outside a VFW post, homeowners becoming parking attendants on their lawns and Obama fans fueling up with pancakes before the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People talked politics at the local hair salon, at the bowling alley. The mayor practiced a speech. Out-of-town visitors drove for hours, and a surge of high school students skipped class, all for the same reason: to witness history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the rally line </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shirley McMinns and her adult son, Daniel Leonard, left their home in Highlands County just before 1 a.m., made it to Knology Park at 4 a.m. and were among the very first in line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMinns, 56, made the nighttime drive, she said, because it was important to get a good seat and make the most of seeing Obama. She also made the trip for her ill mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMinns, who is black, said her mother, 77, had lived through segregation and never believed she would live to see a black man so close to becoming president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She would have loved to come,&quot; McMinns said. When Obama won the Democratic nomination, &quot;she sat there and she cried. She said, 'we will never go back to the time we had separate rest rooms and water fountains.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking refuge at Iris's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an incredibly long line began snaking around the stadium in the hot sun, some Obama supporters took refuge in Iris's Family Restaurant, a local gathering spot across the street from Knology Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday's menu featured &quot;Obama Mama strawberry banana pancakes&quot; for $6.99.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its cheap home-cooking-style meals, Iris's is usually a magnet for snowbirds and local retirees. But owners Rick and Meggan Nelson said their regulars were staying away. Instead, the place filled up with hardcore Democrats wearing T-shirts with slogans like &quot;Barack Star&quot; and &quot;Hot Chicks for Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one booth, young mother Sara Wyley of Clearwater fueled up her three tiny, home-schooled children with pancakes and syrup, wanting them to see history in the making. &quot;Hopefully we'll be able to make it through the wait without them going nuts,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the next booth, two bearded men angrily discussed the proposed federal bailout of financial markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eight years of thievery, lying and corruption. They broke the financial system, and now we're going to bail them out for stealing the American people's money,&quot; said Tony O'Hagen, a retired Merchant Marine who grew up nearby and played Little League ball at Grant Field, where Knology Park is now. &quot;Thank God they didn't privatize Social Security, or senior citizens would be living in refrigerator boxes under the highway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the next booth, Doug Lawley, 66, quietly savored his biscuits and gravy. &quot;Just grabbing breakfast. I'm actually a McCain guy,&quot; he said with a sheepish smile. &quot;Don't tell anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Brassfield, Times Staff Writer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the lanes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Neapolitan ice cream colored bowling balls slowly slid down the glossy lanes before nudging the pins to fall. When there was a strike or near strike, the small group of women in the Wednesday Ladies League would high-five one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cordial but competitive spirit consumed the dimly lighted Dunedin Lanes at 405 Patricia Ave. on Wednesday morning despite the ruckus a few blocks away at Knology Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to bowl,&quot; Marge Gacha, a 72-year-old Clearwater resident and an Obama supporter, said with a laugh. &quot;That's important, too. Obama understands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peggy Roche of Dunedin is undecided on who to vote for, but she's glad Obama is in town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They come to the area and they always go to Tampa or St. Petersburg,&quot; she said. &quot;It's about time someone came to Dunedin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women bowlers, some as old as 90, don't mind expressing opinions about the upcoming election. Some say they go back and forth on who to elect, some say the choice is clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a Republican and a Christian and that tells you who I'm voting for,&quot; said Dot Lindsay, 80, of Oldsmar. &quot;I think he's (Obama) an empty suit and doesn't have the qualifications to run for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Betty Crawley, 68, was giddy as she stepped away from the lane after garnering a strike. She said she's told the ladies of the bowling league what will happen if John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, is elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's going to take your Social Security and privatize it,&quot; the Safety Harbor resident said. &quot;And besides that, (Sarah) Palin doesn't do it for me. I don't skin moose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the final balls were thrown, the women began to look for a place to do lunch.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the mayor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Wednesday morning, the city had pulled together a major campaign event in a few days. So Mayor Bob Hackworth, feet up on his desk, was free to relax into one last task. Quietly, he mumbled through the short speech on 5- by 7-inch note cards that he would soon use to introduce a presidential nominee. The Obama campaign had provided the text, but Hackworth, who also is running for Congress against Republican Bill Young, added a few touches of his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunedin went from a &quot;fine&quot; city to a &quot;great&quot; city. He added this sentence: &quot;For my town and my family, this election is all about the future.'' And he wished the audience a great day in Dunedin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just to make sure he wouldn't forget anything, Hackworth's wife, Gwynne, was there to remind him to bring his notes and of course . . . to remember to turn off his cell phone before he started his speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hours later, Hackworth was first up, even before the prayer and the pledge of allegiance. He waved, he smiled, he hit his mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good afternoon!&quot; he said with enthusiasm, &quot;My name is Bob Hackworth and I'm the mayor, right here in Dunedin!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd roared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When all the speeches were over, a dapper-looking man approached Hackworth. &quot;Mr. Mayor, good speech,&quot; said Richard O'Brien, who will soon move to Pinellas. &quot;Maybe I could do some volunteer work for you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd write you a check if it was a year ago, but times are tough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa Blackwell, Times Staff Writer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parking the cars</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parking was big business in small-town Dunedin. Some people set up with signs ushering cars in. Others stumbled into the role of parking attendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Dee rents a house on Lexington Street, a block south of the stadium. He didn't realize anything was happening until someone woke him up that morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They told me I should go out and make a buck,&quot; Dee said, so he stood out front, collecting $10 a car. He plans to take his fiancee out for dinner with the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who are these people?&quot; asked Ally Booth, when she walked out to check her mail. She lives a block down from Dee. She's not used to seeing the stadium parking stretch so far, so that tipped her off to the fact that something was happening - that and the thrashing sound of the helicopters above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On nearby Roanoke Street, Tammy Adams did the unthinkable: She let people park for free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For baseball games she charges people to park. And across the street, her neighbors were charging $20. But Adams just couldn't bring herself to do it on this historic day for Dunedin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just think it's the right thing,&quot; Adams said. &quot;It's exciting for a little town like Dunedin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And she's not even an Obama supporter. She likes McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Abel, Times Staff Writer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the salon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone at Gregory's Salon was on the same page Wednesday when it came to choosing the next president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most were pleased with the national attention that Obama's visit brought to Dunedin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's pretty neat to have a presidential candidate come to town and put the spotlight on Dunedin,&quot; said Mike Jordan, 34, not an Obama supporter, while waiting for his wife to get highlights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a couple of other patrons were primping with plans to attend the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Female impersonator Natasha Richards got her roots touched up and her eyebrows shaped, hoping to make an impression on &quot;the future president&quot; in case she caught his eye from the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Heather Rudolph got a new 'do with plans to volunteer at the rally helping disabled people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's lots of cute volunteers there,&quot; said Rudolph, 33, as her stylist put the finishing touches on an inverted bob, with highlights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She supports Obama, partly because her mother has lupus, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really think with Obama my mother is going to get the universal health care she needs,&quot; Rudolph said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bit later, salon owner Gregory Brady sat at the appointment desk and logged onto the rally online. While waiting for her highlights to process, Brady's client Glenna Caffee peered at the screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sold on either candidate, yet,&quot; said Caffee, an independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lorri Helfand, Times Staff Writer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the protests</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The our-team-is better-than-your-team rivalry outside Knology Park before Obama's speech was about as benign as a Toronto Blue Jays spring training game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most part, Obama fans waited in line, joking and laughing, excited about the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there were a few McCain supporters who would not be denied attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Freese of St. Petersburg strolled up and down Douglas Avenue with a sign depicting a caricature of Obama and a half white, half black duck, referring to Obama's biracial heritage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cartoon bubble showed Obama saying &quot;The right will say I'm young. They'll say I'm inexperienced. They'll say I've got a funny name. They'll say I don't look like the guys on our currency and they might even say I'm black!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his hands, the Obama drawing was holding a sign saying, &quot;I'm the one we've been waiting for!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The duck was flapping its wings. Its cartoon bubble said, &quot;You're half black Barack! Half black! Half blaaack!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a joke,'' Freese said. &quot;It's funny. It's like the Aflac (insurance commercials).''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boo!'' said the people in line who saw the sign. &quot;Boo!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freese, who is white, was wearing a camouflage hat with a rebel flag stitched on it, and the message &quot;Git-R-Done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've already been called a racist,&quot; Freese said, referring to the hat, but insisting he is not racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waleed McFarland, 29, an African-American Obama volunteer from Tampa, wasn't buying it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the most racist country in the world, and that is a fact,'' he said. &quot;We've got reality TV, but we're further from reality than we've ever been.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eileen Schulte, Times Staff Writer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the high school</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Obama has fans at Dunedin High School, it wasn't apparent Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As hundreds of students took a late-morning break in the school courtyard not a single student was sporting an Obama T-shirt or pin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the teenagers were buzzing about which friends got permission from their parents to take the day off from school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Principal Paul Summa said the school saw a surge in excused absences, with between 40 and 50 students leaving to attend the once-in-a-lifetime event happening less than 3 miles away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sophomore Quadrae McGill said he wasn't able to go but he had friends at the rally who promised to share photos later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's big because he's the first black man to run for president and I'm living through it right now,'' said McGill, 15, who is black. &quot;He's setting a legacy and he's making history and we're part of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rita Farlow, Times Staff Writer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm actually a McCain guy. Don't tell anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida water czar idea rejected -- again</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates gathered to study Florida's future water supply Thursday soundly rejected a proposal to set up any sort of water czar. The Florida Water Congress -- the first statewide gathering of its kind in more than 30 years -- killed the idea because it represented the creation of a new layer of bureaucracy at a time when every level of government is facing major budget cutbacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't see how adding another layer of bureaucracy is going to help,&quot; said Rep. Trudi Williams (http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/SEctions/Representatives/details.aspx?MemberId=4338&amp;SessionId=57), R-Fort Myers, who was representing the Florida Home Builders Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I agree -- get it out of here,&quot; said South Florida Water Management District (http://www.sfwmd.gov/portal/page?_pageid=2754,19862620&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL) executive director Carol Wehle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years ago the state's leading business group, the Council of 100 (http://www.sptimes.com/2003/08/10/State/North_has_it__South_w.shtml), had proposed setting up a state water commission that could route water from rural North Florida to developing South Florida. The proposal, spearheaded by Clearwater real estate mogul Lee Arnold (http://www.colliers.com/Markets/TampaBay/) and megadeveloper Al Hoffman (http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2008/mar/05/gop-nominee-coming-southwest-florida-today/), stirred such outrage that then-Gov. Jeb Bush scuttled it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea came up again this week when the Century Commission for a Sustainable Florida convened the Water Congress (http://www.centurycommission.org/specialevents.asp) in Orlando, a meeting presided over by St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Baker. One of the proposals for the gathering of 120 utility executives, government officials, farmers and environmental activists to consider called for setting up some sort of water czar to oversee water distribution statewide. But not a single delegate supported the idea.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Wall St. meltdown foul up Sugar deal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everglades Among the people nervously watching Wall Street's meltdown: the state officials in charge of pursuing Gov. Charlie Crist's (http://tampabay.com/news/environment/wetlands/article641405.ece) buyout of U.S. Sugar for Everglades restoration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South Florida Water Management District is in charge of negotiating the buyout. The agency expected to finance the purchase -- which could cost as much as $1.75-billion -- by borrowing the money from nine different bankers. Leading the district's list of bankers: Morgan Stanley. Also on the list: Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers. So when the news broke about all three taking a nosedive, it put an additional kink into the already complex negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I saw that, I said, 'Oh crap,' &quot; Carol Wehle, executive director of the South Florida Water Management District (http://www.sfwmd.gov/portal/page?_pageid=2754,19862620&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL), said Thursday while attending the Water Congress (http://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/water/article824694.ece) in Orlando. Wehle said she has no idea at this point how the financing will play out at this point, but she said, &quot;Good thing we're not closing on this tomorrow.&quot; [SFWMD image of Everglades]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Committee paid Aronberg's private club dues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Dave Aronberg joined a private Tallahassee club last year funded by his political committee, which paid his $1,500 dues on April 15, 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Aronberg's challenger, Republican Matt Caldwell, says the move violates Senate rules, because Aronberg used it for his own benefit. Aronberg, a Democrat, says he used the membership for the benefit of the political committee. (You can only buy individual memberships at the Governor's Club, he adds.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one has filed a complaint with the Senate or the elections division yet, but Caldwell's spokesman said we'd see one soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aronberg became a member of the Governor's Club, a private club in Tallahassee that has earned a reputation as a place where lawmakers and lobbyists can spend time out of the public eye. It became a popular hangout after the gift ban clamped down on more public socializing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political committees are funded through companies and lobbyists. In Aronberg's case, the committee called Citizens For Political Accountability had been largely funded by parimutuel companies, Florida PBA and Doral Tobacco at the time his membership was purchased. Lawmakers use the committees as slush funds to pay for travel, meals and consulting. (Buzz remembers when former Rep. Randy Johnson used his for what appeared to be personal expenses like RV repairs. His CPA got into trouble and had to pay a $2,000 fine after a complaint was filed.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An examination of other lawmakers' political committees' expense reports suggests that no other lawmaker (at least that the Buzz could find) had used his committee to purchase a membership. Sens. Jeff Atwater, Paula Dockery and Jim King, among many others, have memberships there that have not been paid by their political committees. Buzz knows that several House members like Rep. Adam Hasner and Ron Reagan are also members. Hasner says his wife bought their personal membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aronberg said he cleared his membership purchase with ethics attorneys and he joined to avoid running amok of the gift ban (by, say, eating on a ticket of a member who lobbies the Legislature. Many lawmakers eat there and then reimburse members in cash.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did it to raise money for the CCE,&quot; Aronbeg said. &quot;Everything was disclosed immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Wilson, a new spokesman for Caldwell, accused Aronberg of &quot;taking an illegal and unethical gratuity from a CCE that is used as his personal political vehicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats seek 'holdback' details from Crist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For weeks, the House Democratic Caucus has been seeking more detailed information from Gov. Charlie Crist's administration on the real-life impacts of the 4 percent &quot;holdback&quot; Crist ordered July 1 to avoid a budget deficit (agencies and programs are getting 24 percent of their quarterly budget allotments).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter to Crist from Rep. Dan Gelber, which was not made public when it was sent, says: &quot;We appreciate that with the specter of an election looming, many will want to put off some of these important decisions to next year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our caucus, however, would like to get a better grasp of how you plan to meet the deficit,&quot; wrote Gelber, D-Miami Beach, the House Democratic leader. His letter claims that any unilateral action by the governor violates a 1991 Florida Supreme Court decision in Chiles v. Children A, B, C, D, E and F, which cited &quot;the legislative responsibility to set fiscal priorities.&quot; (Crist's administration says he can impose a holdback, under Section 13 of the Constitution).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curiously, Gelber and the House Democrats did not release the Aug. 15 letter (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/letter_gov_8_15_08.pdf) when they sent it to Crist (The St. Pete Times obtained a copy this week). Since then, the Legislative Budget Commission passed Crist's request to reduce the current year deficit by $672-million, leaving a $795-million gap. The letter prompted a meeting last week between Gelber and Crist's chief of staff and budget director, but Gelber said Thursday he's still waiting for more information.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result: Varn was off the ballot.</SPAN></P>

Then how come retiree Lucille Shea of Dunnellon saw two McCain ads on CBS today bashing Obama for his ties to convicted developer Tony Rezko? Mrs. Shea wanted to know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He made the statement that he's closing his campaign and he's pulling his ads, and this is a dirty, nasty ad,'' said Shea, a Democrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Mario Diaz: John McCain indicated yesterday that he was (suspending) all advertising, and the campaign is doing just that. All of this is being done as quickly as possible, but it takes time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla., has introduced a Senate version House-passed bill aimed at finding missing seniors. The House version, which was introduced by U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Palm Harbor, had the support of the entire Florida delegation and passed by voice vote last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It directs the U.S. Department of Justice to design a program that will give states grants for Silver Alert systems, akin to the Amber Alert, that will help local law enforcement agencies and the public find seniors who wander off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martinez's version is slightly different, but could be reconciled with the House version if it passes. He filed the measure with Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., a fellow member of the Special Committee on Aging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every year thousands of adults go missing due to illness, diminished mental capacity or foul play,&quot; Martinez said in a statement. &quot;This kind of coordinated alert system has had proven success with locating missing children. Expanding it to include adults and seniors will give families and local law enforcement agencies access to the resources and expertise necessary to undertake more comprehensive search efforts for a missing adult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bilirakis' bill was inspired by the death of Mary Zelter, a Largo woman who was found drowned in the Intracoastal Waterway a week after she left her assisted living facility.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's continuing Jewish problem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not a FL-specific poll, but it points to a real problem for Barack Obama in FL. A new national poll (http://www.ajc.org/site/pp.aspx?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=4540689&amp;printmode=1) of 914 Jewish voters commissioned by the American Jewish Congress shows Obama receiving 57 percent support and John McCain 30 percent (54 percent disapproved of the Sarah Palin pick). Remember that in 2004 Bush received 25 percent of the Jewish vote nationally and 20 percent in Florida, according to exit polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mind you, only about 5 percent of the Florida electorate is Jewish. But serious slippage in the Democratic base makes it all that much harder for Obama to make up that 380,000-vote margin by which Republicans picked off FL four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest St. Petersburg Times poll showed FL Jews splitting 74-21 percent, but the margin of error on that sample is so big that those numbers can't be taken seriously.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Party of Florida Chairman Jim Greer is demanding that Democrats and the Obama campaign denounce comments (http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/24/florida-congressman-points-to-palin-to-rally-jews-to-obama/) U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings made regarding Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alcee Hastings managed to attack sportsmen, African-Americans and the Jewish community in one sentence,&quot; Greer said. &quot;By claiming that Gov. Palin and those Americans who choose to bear arms do not care about the Jewish and African-American citizens of our country, Hastings is viciously throwing the worst kind of stereotypes at the wall and hoping one of them sticks. Even more unfortunate is the fact that this statement comes on the heels of an Obama Florida staff member's comments that Gov. Palin was a 'Nazi sympathizer.' The staffer had the good sense to backtrack from his comments, and so should Alcee Hastings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Jewish Coalition's executive director, Matt Brooks, also weighed in today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rep. Hastings stooped to the worst kind of divisive politics yesterday. Hastings' unconscionable remarks do nothing but sow seeds of fear and divide people,&quot; Brooks said. &quot;There should be no place in our country for this sort of political discourse. We can constructively disagree on the issues without denigrating others.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Progress Florida today has begun a statewide petition (http://www.progressflorida.org/ProtectOurVote) drive urging Gov. Charlie Crist to prevent efforts to &quot;confuse and disenfranchise voters this election.&quot;</SPAN></P>

A letter signed by John McCain tells the Democrats: &quot;We have you registered as a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gov. Crist is the leader of the Republican Party in Florida and he can take the necessary action to stop dirty tricks and make this a fair, accurate and inclusive election,&quot; Progress Florida said.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the giant mortgage companies at the heart of the credit crisis paid $15,000 a month from the end of 2005 through last month to a firm owned by Sen. John McCain's campaign manager, according to two people with direct knowledge of the arrangement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disclosure undercuts a statement by McCain on Sunday night that the campaign manager, Rick Davis, had had no involvement with the company for the last several years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis' firm received the payments from the company, Freddie Mac, until it was taken over by the government this month along with Fannie Mae, the other big mortgage lender whose deteriorating finances helped precipitate the cascading problems on Wall Street, the two people said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said they did not recall Davis doing much substantive work for the company in return for the money, other than speaking to a political action committee of high-ranking employees in October 2006 on the approaching midterm congressional elections. They said Davis' firm, Davis Manafort, had been kept on the payroll because of Davis' close ties to McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, who by 2006 was widely expected to run again for the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis took a leave from Davis Manafort for the presidential campaign, but as a partner and equity holder continues to benefit from its income. No one at Davis Manafort other than Davis was involved in efforts on Freddie Mac's behalf, the people familiar with the arrangement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Freddie Mac spokeswoman said the company would not comment. Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for the McCain campaign, did not dispute the payments to Davis' firm. But she said that Davis had stopped taking a salary from his firm by the end of 2006 and that his work did not affect McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. McCain's positions on policy matters are based upon what he believes to be in the public interest,&quot; Hazelbaker said in a written statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disclosure comes at a time when McCain and Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, are sparring over ties to lobbyists and special interests and seeking political advantage in a campaign reshaped by the financial crisis and the plan to bail out investment firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign has been attacking Obama for ties to former officials of the mortgage lenders, both of which have long histories of cultivating allies in the two parties to fend off efforts to restrict their activities. McCain has been running a television commercial suggesting Obama takes advice on housing issues from Franklin D. Raines, the former chief executive of Fannie Mae, a contention flatly denied by Raines and the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freddie Mac's roughly $500,000 in payments to Davis Manafort began immediately after Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae in late 2005 disbanded an advocacy coalition that they had set up and hired Davis to run, the people familiar with the arrangement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 2000 to the end of 2005, Davis had received nearly $2 million as president of the coalition, the Homeownership Alliance, which the companies created to help them oppose new regulations and protect their status as federally chartered companies with implicit government backing. That status let them borrow cheaply, helping to fuel rapid growth but also enabled their increased purchases of the risky mortgage securities that proved to be their downfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The payments that Davis received for leading the Homeownership Alliance were reported in Monday's issue of The New York Times. On Sunday, in an interview with CNBC and The Times, McCain responded to a question about that tie between Davis and the two mortgage companies by saying that he &quot;has had nothing to do with it since, and I'll be glad to have his record examined by anybody who wants to look at it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such assertions, along with McCain campaign television advertisements tying Obama to former Fannie Mae chiefs, have riled current and former officials of the two companies and prompted them to volunteer rebuttals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two people with direct knowledge of Freddie Mac's post-2005 contract with Davis spoke on condition of anonymity. Four other outside consultants -- three Democrats and a Republican, also speaking on condition of anonymity -- said the arrangement was widely known among people involved in Freddie Mac's lobbying efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As president of the Homeownership Alliance, Davis got $30,000 to $35,000 a month. Davis, along with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has characterized the alliance as a coalition of many housing industry and consumer groups to promote homeownership, but numerous current and former officials at both companies say the two mortgage companies created and bankrolled the operation to combat efforts by competitors to rein in their business. They dissolved the group at the end of 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the McCain campaign attacked The Times for its account of those payments to Davis, saying the paper was &quot;150 percent in the tank&quot; for Obama. Davis said that he had worked not for the two companies but for the advocacy group, which included other organizations as well and, he said, was focused only on promoting homeownership. After the Homeownership Alliance was dissolved, Davis asked to stay on a retainer, the people familiar with the deal said. Hollis McLoughlin, who was chief of staff to Richard F. Syron, Freddie Mac's chief executive, arranged for a new contract with Davis Manafort, at the reduced rate of $15,000 a month, they said. Syron lost his job in the government takeover this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several other people associated with McCain have McCain and his advisers have argued that whatever connections Davis and other McCain campaign officials have had to the mortgage giants, McCain in the Senate has been an advocate for reforming them. And they have suggested that Obama is linked to the companies through donations from their employees with ties to former officials there. Those officials include James Johnson, a former chief executive of Fannie Mae, was the head of Obama's vice presidential search team until stepping aside after coming under criticism for having received a mortgage on preferential terms from ill-fated Countrywide Financial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since his first campaign for the Senate in 2004, Obama has received about $126,000 in contributions from employees of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while Sen. McCain, over the last decade, has received about $22,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors are anxiously waiting for Washington lawmakers to hash out the details of the biggest government bailout in history - a politically fraught process that will create a new slate of winners and losers on Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some key questions as the financial crisis unfolds:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is the government planning to spend hundreds of billions to bail out financial companies? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because we're all caught in the shakeout already, not just companies directly linked to troubled mortgages. Last week, the credit crunch had reached crisis levels: Banks were charging exorbitant fees to other banks seeking overnight loans; credit card companies like American Express were slashing credit limits for many typically creditworthy customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure of major financial companies could inflict more damage on consumers' credit cards, auto loans and home mortgages, said Patrick Kelly, assistant professor of finance at the University of South Florida. And that would be particularly painful for an economy like Florida's, which is already struggling through a housing meltdown and rising unemployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would definitely make ... mortgages much more difficult to get, which would mean the housing market would get even worse,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;I'm not saying instantaneously, but weeks, months, you can't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much will this cost us?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Treasury has proposed creating a $700-billion fund to buy mortgage-related assets from troubled institutions. That price tag refers to only the maximum the government can hold of these assets at any time. The government may purchase far more than $700-billion of securities, as it buys and then sells assets. So, no one knows yet what the actual cost will be nor how much the government will recoup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Resolution Trust Corp., which bought up troubled S&amp;Ls in the 1980s, was expected to cost the federal government up to $500-billion but wound up costing $125-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more the United States has to borrow, the greater the risk that the U.S. dollar will be devalued. Indeed, on Monday investors worried that the government's proposal will dramatically ramp up U.S. borrowing, an inflationary move that sent the value of the dollar sharply lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What else did regulators do over the weekend?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They let Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the last two large independent investment banks in the country, become bank holding companies. The two institutions were crippled by their inability to raise money as investors pulled back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial and investment banks both make loans, but one of the big differences is the way they bring in money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial banks have the benefit of depositors. The banks then turn around and lend that money at a higher interest rate. Investment banks, on the other hand, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, do not have depositors - at least did not in the old way of doing things. Instead, they borrowed money by issuing short-term debt and selling shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By adding depositors, they gain access to a larger pool of money. But there are also drawbacks, namely a high level of regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was this preventable?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expect the blame game to play out over months, if not years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain says he would fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic candidate Barack Obama responded, &quot;Don't get rid of one guy. Get rid of this administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, told NPR, &quot;This is a man-made, avoidable, preventable problem ... and a lack of oversight and accountability was one of the problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is my cash in money-market funds safe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the 75-year-old Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., every checking account, savings account and certificate of deposit is insured by the federal government for up to $100,000 per person per institution, with some caveats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government agreed Friday to extend the same protection, at least temporarily, to money-market mutual funds. But the Treasury Department is covering only current holdings in money market funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Bankers Association had warned regulators that covering all incoming deposits could spark a flight from bank accounts and Treasury debt to higher-paying money-market funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should I put my money in a mattress?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say that's the wrong attitude. Bank accounts backed up by the FDIC are safer than a mattress. Besides, the volatility of late doesn't change the long-term projections for the stock market or the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Particularly for those in their 20s, 30s, 40s and even early 50s, don't let the volatility of the stock market scare you into derailing your long-term financial security,&quot; said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com. &quot;Over the long term, it's the allocation to stocks that's going to give you the growth needed to meet your long-range financial goals such as retirement.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama&nbsp;ad contends that John McCain endorses Rush Limbaugh's comments about immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Sept. 18 in a Spanish language TV ad called &quot;Dos Caras&quot; (Two Faces) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad begins with McCain pictured next to President Bush. A voiceover says: &quot;They want us to forget the insults we've put up with ... the intolerance ... they made us feel marginalized in this country we love so much.&quot; Then the screen flashes a picture of conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh above two quotes from him: &quot;... stupid and unskilled Mexicans&quot; and &quot;You shut your mouth or you get out!&quot; Then the announcer continues: &quot;John McCain and his Republican friends have two faces. One that says lies just to get our vote and another, even worse, that continues the policies of George Bush that put special interests ahead of working families. John McCain ... more of the same old Republican tricks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's odd to see McCain attacked for sharing the views of Limbaugh, who openly dislikes McCain, especially on immigration. Limbaugh railed against the McCain overhaul that would have given illegal aliens a path to citizenship, calling it &quot;amnesty.&quot; To suggest McCain and Limbaugh see eye-to-eye on the issue is, as Limbaugh himself put it, &quot;absurd.&quot; And the inflammatory Limbaugh quotes? They were taken badly out of context. &quot;Stupid and unskilled Mexicans,&quot; is from 1993, during the NAFTA debate. Said Limbaugh: &quot;If we are going to start rewarding no skills and stupid people, I'm serious, let the unskilled jobs that take absolutely no knowledge whatsoever to do - let stupid and unskilled Mexicans do that work.&quot; Limbaugh wasn't calling Mexicans &quot;stupid and unskilled.&quot; And, &quot;You shut your mouth or you get out!&quot; is from 2006. Limbaugh actually was paraphrasing Mexican immigration law. Misusing these quotes, especially to link McCain with Limbaugh on immigration, isn't just wrong, it's pantalones en fuego wrong.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rasmussen robo poll 9/21: John McCain 51%, Barack Obama 46%: &quot;Both nationally and in Florida, polling suggests the race for the White House today is very similar to the final results for Election 2004. The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll shows McCain with a very modest lead nationally, and his five-point edge in Florida matches President Bush's margin of victory in the state four years ago. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain is viewed favorably by 55% of Florida voters and unfavorably by 45%. Obama's numbers are 50% favorable, 48% unfavorable. The GOP nominee has a solid 56% to 40% edge among unaffiliated voters in the Sunshine State. He also leads 53% to 44% among men and 51% to 47% among women.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years after he was embroiled in scandal with lobbyist Jack Abramoff, U.S. Rep. Tom Feeney is saying sorry -- on TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a highly unusual ad, which begins tomorrow and will run for 10 days, the Oviedo Republican says he made a &quot;rookie mistake&quot; by going on a golfing excursion to Scotland with the now-b&ecirc;te noire of Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feeney notes that he eventually reported and paid for the trip. &quot;I embarrassed myself. I embarrassed you. And for that, I'm very sorry,&quot; Feeney, sitting at a kitchen table, says over calming piano music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing can mean only one thing: Feeney is deeply worried about being re-elected. It comes on the heels of internal polling released by his opponent, Democrat Suzanne Kosmas, showing a dead heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know the Kosmas campaign is going to make an issue of this 5-year-old story and Tom, once again, wants to be pro-active and straightforward about it,&quot; said his spokeswoman Pepper Pennington. Kosmas' response to the ad is here.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atwater's Democratic challenger, Linda Bird, has raised $33,000. To put Atwater's largesse in a bit of historical perspective, Agriculture Commissioner Charlie Bronson raised $1.7-million for his statewide victory in 2006.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain Accuses Obama Of Lacking Leadership</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BALTIMORE - Republican presidential nominee John McCain told an audience Sunday that Barack Obama behaves more like a politician than a leader, both on matters of national security and on the near-meltdown of the U.S. financial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a meeting of the National Guard Association, McCain faulted Obama for not offering a plan to stabilize financial markets after a crisis in the mortgage industry led to the collapse of two investment banks and the government bailout of housing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and insurance giant AIG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain laid out a series of proposals for helping to stabilize the mortgage industry, such as a Mortgage and Financial Institutions Trust, on the same day that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson outlined a bailout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama declined to offer a plan, saying he wanted Paulson to address the matter without political intrusion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea behind the Political Browser, expected to start today, is to brief political junkies on the top &quot;must reads&quot; of the day, from an article on a scandal to a humorous video making the rounds on YouTube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franken Inspires McCain Skit On 'SNL'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MINNEAPOLIS - Senate candidate Al Franken provided his old &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; boss with the inspiration for a comedy sketch that lampooned Republican presidential candidate John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franken had a phone conversation last week with SNL creator Lorne Michaels, his campaign spokeswoman Colleen Murray said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In relating a story about recording campaign commercials, Franken noted how all candidates must say they &quot;approve this message&quot; in ads - and editorialized that he thought it must be a difficult task for McCain, whom many Democrats and pundits have accused of leveling dishonest charges against Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the sketch, McCain is played by &quot;SNL&quot; veteran Darrell Hammond. While recording campaign commercials, McCain is forced to say that he &quot;approves this message&quot; over a series of increasingly vicious and ludicrous attacks against Obama.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama plans &quot;a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, Aug. 11 in an Internet ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign's evidence for its charges are Obama's votes on budget resolutions. A kind of blueprint for the federal budget, a budget resolution sets targets for committees that write legislation on taxes and spending. Obama joined Democrats on what were largely party-line votes expressing the desire to roll back the Bush tax cuts in order to fund popular programs. The resolution envisions tax cuts rescinded on people making about $42,000 and higher. But voting for a budget resolution is quite different from voting for a tax increase. Budget resolutions are nonbinding, don't have the force of law and don't include precise details on taxes or spending. They're different from legislation that raises or lowers tax rates. The McCain&nbsp;ad seems designed to make the average viewer think Obama wants to raise taxes on people making $42,000 and higher, which isn't true. Obama wants to increase taxes by rolling back the Bush tax cuts on people making more than $200,000 if single or $250,000 if married filing jointly. What the ad implies is a major distortion that seems intent on confusing people about what Obama's policies are. We rate McCain's claim False. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breaks for all companies; credit for kids</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain offers &quot;billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies, but almost nothing for families like yours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Aug. 11 in a television ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under McCain's proposed tax plan, it is true that oil and drug companies would get reduced taxes, but this is because McCain advocates lowering the overall corporate tax rate, from 35 percent to 25 percent. He's not doling out special breaks for particular industries. This part of the ad is a significant distortion of McCain's plan. The ad also says that McCain offers &quot;almost nothing for families like yours.&quot; This isn't entirely accurate either. McCain proposes increasing the tax exemption for dependents from $3,500 to $7,000. Obama, on the other hand, proposes several tax cuts aimed at the middle and lower incomes: a $500 tax credit for workers to offset payroll taxes, mortgage interest deductions for people who don't itemize their returns, expansion of the earned-income tax credit, and eliminating taxes for seniors who make less than $50,000. The statement that McCain offers &quot;almost nothing for families like yours,&quot; though, depends on what your family is like. McCain does propose increasing the exemption for dependents. Some families will consider that a significant tax savings while others might rate it &quot;almost nothing.&quot; Putting the statements together, we rate this Barely True.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain supports the Bush tax cuts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Bush tax cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was one of the few Republicans who opposed tax cuts proposed by President Bush in 2001, and he opposed them again when they came up for renewal in 2003. In 2001, McCain voted against a $1.35-trillion tax cut package, arguing that the tax cuts didn't do enough for the middle class, and because of a need for increased defense spending. Two years later, McCain again cited fiscal prudence for opposing $350-billion in additional tax cuts, specifically citing the unknown costs of the war in Iraq. &quot;No one can be expected to make an informed decision about fiscal policy at this time,&quot; McCain said. When the tax cuts came up for renewal again in 2006, though, he voted in favor of them. McCain said he supported the tax-cut extensions, which also reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividend income, because &quot;American businesses and investors need a stable and predictable tax policy to continue contributing to the growth of our economy. These considerations lead me to the conclusion that we should not reverse course by letting higher tax rates take effect.&quot; This is an actual change of position for McCain, so we rate it a Full Flop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worker credit cuts middle-class taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's tax plan cuts taxes &quot;for 95 percent of all working families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Wednesday in Elko, Nev.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The linchpin here is Obama's tax credit for workers, which is intended to offset payroll taxes. Single people can qualify for a $500 credit; married couples could get $1,000. Obama wants to roll back the Bush tax cuts for people who make $200,000 or more for singles and $250,000 or more for married couples. Those people would get the credit, too, under Obama's proposal, but it would be wiped out by their higher tax rates. Most people, though, don't make more than $200,000. In fact, according to Internal Revenue Service statistics, about 97 percent of all filers made less than that. Now, Obama said his tax plan would reduce taxes for 95 percent of working families. We consulted the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which created detailed models for how candidates' tax proposals would affect taxpayers. Under Obama's plan, the center finds: 95 percent of all tax filers would get a cut in their individual income taxes; and 95 percent of all families with children would get a cut in their total federal taxes. Every taxpayer has different circumstances, but if you make less than $200,000 a year and you work, we can't see how your taxes would go up under Obama's plan. We rate this statement True.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key points of their platforms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush tax cuts are set to expire during the next president's term, and each candidate has a different way of addressing that, along with other tax proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Keep the Bush tax cuts in place for all income levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Expand the tax exemption for dependents (often children), eventually doubling it to $7,000 per dependent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Reduce the maximum corporate tax rates by 10 points, from 35 percent to 25 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Roll back the Bush tax cuts for those making $200,000 or more. Leave others as is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Give each worker a $500 credit to offset payroll taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Eliminate income taxes for seniors making less than $50,000 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Allow nonitemizers to deduct mortgage interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Increase payroll taxes for workers making more than $200,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Note: The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said McCain's plan could grow the economy by cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy, but it also would increase the budget deficit. The center said Obama's plan would encourage more low-income people to join the work force. But it questions his plans to help seniors and homeowners, two groups already favored under the tax code.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As presidential hopefuls John McCain and Barack Obama get ready for forums, you can take a closer look at what they support regarding subjects most important to you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama will share the stage this Friday for the first of three presidential candidate forums. The first, to be held at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Miss., will focus on domestic issues. The second, on Oct. 7 at Belmont University in Nashville, will be a town-hall format with questions submitted by the audience. The third, on Oct. 15 at Hofstra University in New York, is devoted to foreign policy questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A debate between the vice presidential candidates, Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Sarah Palin, is scheduled for Oct. 2 at Washington University in St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is a snapshot of where the presidential candidates stand, and a look into what has been found about the public's mood, on 21 issues: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABORTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Opposes abortion rights. Has voted for abortion restrictions permissible under Roe v. Wade and now says he would seek to overturn that guarantee of abortion rights. Would not seek constitutional amendment to ban abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Favors abortion rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: According to a Gallup poll in May, 54 percent of Americans think abortion should be legal under certain circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFGHANISTAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Favors unspecified boost in U.S. forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Would add about 7,000 troops to the U.S. force of 36,000, bringing reinforcements from Iraq. Has threatened unilateral attack on high-value terrorist targets in Pakistan &quot;if Pakistan cannot or will not act&quot; against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: An Associated Press poll this month found that a plurality of Americans favors increasing U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan, with 28 percent strongly favoring and 20 percent somewhat favoring it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAMPAIGN FINANCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: The co-author of McCain-Feingold campaign finance law is running his general campaign with public money and within its spending limits. He urged Obama to do the same. He applied for federal matching funds for primaries but later turned them down so he could spend more than the limits. The Federal Election Commission belatedly approved his decision to bypass the primary funds, but rejected McCain's claim that he needed no such approval. He raised more than $160 million before having to stop to accept the $84 million in public money for the fall. McCain accepted primary campaign contributions from lobbyists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: The presidential campaign's fundraising champion has brought in more than $450 million. He is raising private money for his general election, despite his proposal last year to accept public financing and its spending limits if the Republican nominee does, too. Obama refuses to accept money from federal lobbyists and has instructed the Democratic National Committee to do the same for its joint victory fund, an account that would benefit the nominee. Obama does accept money from state lobbyists and from family members of federal lobbyists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: According to an April 2007 Gallup poll, most Americans would prefer that presidential candidates not take public financing for their campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CATASTROPHIC FUND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Opposes a national catastrophe fund as a way to help stabilize homeowners insurance premiums. Says he will work with governors of the most affected states to pool insurance risks against hurricanes. He says broad pooling will improve prices and effective regulation can support the quality policies needed by homeowners and businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Supports the creation of a national catastrophic insurance program as a way to help stabilize homeowners insurance premiums. He co-sponsored a bipartisan bill that would spread the risk of hurricanes and other natural disasters to provide homeowners some relief, and pledged to sign the bill into law as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: Public opinion has not been measured by a major independent polling organization. A bill to establish a national fund has passed the House, but not the Senate, and President Bush has said he will veto the legislation if it does pass. The congressional budget office estimated the fund would cost taxpayers $25 billion annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CUBA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Ease restrictions on Cuba once the United States is &quot;confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Ease restrictions on family-related travel and on money Cuban-Americans want to send their families in Cuba. Open to meeting new Cuban leader Raul Castro without preconditions. Ease trade embargo if Havana &quot;begins opening Cuba to meaningful democratic change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: According to the 2007 Florida International University's Cuba Poll, approximately 65 percent of the South Florida Cuban-American community would support a dialogue with the Cuban government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEATH PENALTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Has supported expansion of the federal death penalty and limits on appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Supports death penalty for crimes where the &quot;community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage.&quot; As Illinois lawmaker, wrote bill mandating videotaping of interrogations and confessions in capital cases and sought other changes in system that had produced wrongful convictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: According to Quinnipiac University poll in July, 63 percent of Americans favor the death penalty for persons convicted of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECONOMY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: On Friday, said the Federal Reserve should stop bailing out failing financial institutions. As president, would create a Mortgage and Financial Institutions Trust to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. Although he has generally championed deregulation throughout his career in the Senate, he now calls for a commission to find out what went wrong in the financial markets and how to better regulate them. Supported legislation in 1999 that tore down Depression-era legal walls separating commercial banks, investment banks and insurers from one another. President Clinton, a Democrat, signed it into law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: On Friday, said he supports giving &quot;broad authority&quot; to the Treasury Department to deal with credit crisis, but says he's not giving details of his own plans in order to avoid roiling the markets further. Says a recovery plan should not reward reckless business leaders. Refused to put a price tag on a plan he would support, but said it would not bar him from advocating middle-class tax cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll this month found the economic problems that most concern Americans are the price of gasoline (35 percent), the availability of jobs (28 percent), mortgages and home values (18 percent) and taxes (18 percent). The economy, the poll found, had replaced the Iraq war as the most important issue voters would weigh in voting for a presidential candidate: 31 percent cited the Iraq war in June 2007, but only 13 percent said so in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDUCATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: He is not proposing a federal voucher program that would provide public money for private school tuition, in contrast to his proposed $5 billion voucher plan in 2000. Only proposes expansion of District of Columbia's voucher program. Sees No Child Left Behind law as vehicle for increasing opportunities for parents to choose schools. Proposes more money for community college education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Proposes an $18 billion plan that would encourage, but not mandate, universal pre-kindergarten. Teacher pay raises tied to, although not based solely on, test scores. An overhaul of No Child Left Behind law to better measure student progress, make room for non-core subjects such as music and art and be less punitive toward failing schools. A tax credit to pay up to $4,000 of college costs for students who perform 100 hours of community service a year. Obama would pay for part of his plan by ending corporate tax deductions for CEO pay. Has backed away from his proposal to save money for education by delaying NASA's manned moon and Mars missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: According to an AP poll in June, most Americans would be willing to pay more in taxes if the money were spent on hiring more teachers and improving public school facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENERGY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Favors increased offshore drilling, but is opposed to drilling in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Argues that prohibiting more drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf stands in the way of energy exploration and production. Thinks states, including Florida, should be able to decide whether to expand drilling off their coasts. Would use federal money to help build 45 nuclear power reactors by 2030. Proposed suspending the 18-cent a gallon federal gasoline tax but idea got no traction. Global warming plan would increase energy costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Now would consider limited increase in offshore drilling, but opposes drilling in Arctic reserve. Proposes windfall-profit tax on largest oil companies to pay for energy rebate of up to $1,000. Opposed suspension of the gas tax. Proposed releasing 70 million barrels of oil from Strategic Petroleum Reserve to boost supplies. Global warming plan would increase energy costs. Supports forcing oil and gas companies to drill on the 68 million acres of already leased areas, but remains skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short-term. Says care must be taken to protect Florida's coastal resources and the tourism industry they support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll in August found most Americans favor increased offshore drilling for oil and natural gas, and most favor drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. A Mason-Dixon poll in August found 61 percent of Floridians favor drilling for oil and natural gas off the state's coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVERGLADES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Expressed support this spring for Everglades restoration and his commitment to doing so as president. He missed the vote on the issue and later urged President Bush to veto a broader $23 billion water bill that authorized $2 billion for Everglades cleanup. McCain said that was because it included millions of dollars for other projects he considered wasteful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Says he supports the restoration of the Everglades and as president will make this project a top environmental priority. He supported the Water Resources Development Act, which would have allocated $2 billion in federal funding to help Florida restore the Everglades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: Public opinion has not been measured by a major independent polling organization. As conceived in 2000, the restoration plan was to be a 50-50 split between the state and federal governments. A bill to have the federal government spend about $23 billion on water projects, including $2 billion on the Everglades, passed Congress, was vetoed by President Bush, then overridden by Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GAY MARRIAGE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Opposes constitutional amendment to ban it. Says same-sex couples should be allowed to enter into legal agreements for insurance and similar benefits, and states should decide about marriage. Supports the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition of same-sex marriages and gives states the right to refuse to recognize such marriages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Opposes constitutional amendment to ban it. Supports civil unions, says states should decide about marriage. Switched positions in 2004 and now supports repeal of Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition of same-sex marriages and gives states the right to refuse to recognize such marriages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: According to an AP poll this month, 49 percent of Americans think the federal government should not give legal recognition to same-sex marriages, and 47 percent said it should.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GLOBAL WARMING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Broke with President Bush on global warming. Led Senate effort to cap greenhouse gas emissions. Favors plan that would see greenhouse gas emissions cut by 66 percent by 2050.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Ten-year, $150 billion program to produce &quot;climate friendly&quot; energy supplies that he'd pay for with a carbon auction requiring businesses to bid competitively for the right to pollute and aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050. Joined McCain in sponsoring earlier legislation that would set mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions. Increase federal fuel economy requirements beyond 35 mpg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: According to a Gallup poll in March, most Americans worry about global warming and think the effects of it are already happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUN CONTROL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Voted against ban on assault-type weapons but in favor of requiring background checks at gun shows. Voted to shield gun manufacturers and dealers from civil suits. &quot;I believe the Second Amendment ought to be preserved, which means no gun control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Voted to leave gun manufacturers and dealers open to suit. Also, as Illinois state lawmaker, supported ban on all forms of semiautomatic weapons and tighter state restrictions generally on firearms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: According to a Quinnipiac University poll in July, most Americans support stricter gun control laws but oppose a constitutional ban on individual gun ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEALTH CARE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Supports $2,500 refundable tax credit for individuals, $5,000 for families, to make health insurance more affordable. No mandate for universal coverage. In gaining the tax credit, workers could not deduct the portion of their workplace health insurance paid by their employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Supports mandatory coverage for children, no mandate for adults. Aim for universal coverage by requiring employers to share costs of insuring workers and by offering coverage similar to that in plan for federal employees. Says package would cost up to $65 billion a year after unspecified savings from making system more efficient. Raise taxes on wealthier families to pay the cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: An ABC News/Washington Post poll in June found most Americans think it is important to provide health care coverage for all, even if it means raising taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOUSING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Open to helping homeowners facing foreclosure if they are &quot;legitimate borrowers&quot; not speculators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Tax credit covering 10 percent of annual mortgage-interest payments for &quot;struggling homeowners,&quot; scoring system for consumers to compare mortgages, a fund for mortgage-fraud victims, new penalties for mortgage fraud and aid to state and local governments stung by housing crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: According to a Gallup poll in March, most Americans favor having the federal government take steps to prevent people from losing their homes because they can't pay their mortgages. Most Republicans oppose federal intervention and most Democrats and Independents favor intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMMIGRATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Sponsored 2006 bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants to stay in the United States, work and apply to become legal residents after learning English, paying fines and back taxes and clearing a background check. Now says he would secure the border first. Supports border fence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Voted for 2006 bill offering legal status to illegal immigrants subject to conditions, including English proficiency and payment of back taxes and fines. Voted for border fence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: According to an AP poll in April, 49 percent of Americans favor building a fence along the border between the United States and Mexico, and 48 percent oppose it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IRAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Favors tougher sanctions, opposes direct high-level talks with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Initially said he would meet Ahmadinejad without preconditions, now says he's not sure. Says direct diplomacy with Iranian leaders would give the United States more credibility to press for tougher international sanctions. Says he would intensify diplomatic pressure on Tehran before Israel feels the need to take unilateral military action against Iranian nuclear facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: According to a Gallup poll in July, Americans ranked Iran as the country's greatest enemy (25 percent), followed by Iraq (22 percent), China (14 percent) and North Korea (9 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IRAQ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Opposes scheduling a troop withdrawal, saying latest strategy is succeeding. Supported decision to go to war, but was early critic of the manner in which administration prosecuted it. Was key backer of the troop increase. Willing to have permanent U.S. peacekeeping forces in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Spoke against war at start, opposed troop increase. Voted against one major military spending bill in May 2007; otherwise voted in favor of money to support the war. Says his plan would complete withdrawal of combat troops in 16 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: According to an AP poll this month, most Americans favor setting a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOCIAL SECURITY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: &quot;Nothing's off the table&quot; when it comes to saving Social Security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Would raise payroll tax on wealthiest by applying it to portion of income over $250,000. Now, payroll tax is applied to income up to $102,000. Rules out raising the retirement age for benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: According to a CBS News poll last October, most Americans think the financial situation of Social Security is threatened, with 30 percent saying it's a crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STEM CELL RESEARCH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Supports relaxing federal restrictions on financing of embryonic stem cell research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Supports relaxing federal restrictions on financing of embryonic stem cell research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: An April 2007 Gallup poll found a plurality of Americans, 38 percent, think the federal government should ease restrictions on federal funding for stem cell research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAXES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Pledged not to raise taxes, then equivocated, saying nothing can be ruled out in negotiating compromises to keep Social Security solvent. Twice opposed Bush's tax cuts, at first because he said they were tilted to the wealthiest and again because of the unknown costs of Iraq war. Now says those tax cuts, expiring in 2010, should be permanent. Proposes cutting corporate tax rate to 25 percent. Promises balanced budget in first term, says that is unlikely in his first year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: Would raise income taxes on wealthiest and their capital gains and dividends taxes. Raise corporate taxes. Proposes $80 billion in tax breaks mainly for poor workers and elderly, including tripling Earned Income Tax Credit for minimum-wage workers and higher credit for larger families. Would eliminate tax-filing requirement for older workers making less than $50,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said: In a Gallup poll in April, 52 percent of Americans think the amount of federal income tax they have to pay is too high. The poll found most Americans think lower-income people are paying too much, middle-income people are paying their fair share and upper-income people are paying too little.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's nowhere near the end of the world, but it does feel like the days immediately after Sept. 11, 2001, when the nation was knocked off its moorings and the future seemed uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No buildings collapsed in the current economic trouble, but venerable companies have fallen in one shock after another: Lehman Brothers filed for history's biggest bankruptcy; the government bailed out AIG, one of the world's biggest insurers; the government took control of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the nation's two mortgage giants; Bank of America swallowed whole Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and its famous bull; and the Treasury is underwriting the safety of private money market funds and sending the Federal Reserve $40 billion to &quot;help them better manage their balance sheet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All told, taxpayers have been saddled with potential liability of $1 trillion, even as many everyday Americans have seen their savings dwindle and their home equity disappear. Many experienced observers are calling it a financial crisis, perhaps the worst since the Great Depression. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bipartisan Blame</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A top-level investigation is essential to find out exactly what went wrong and why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain is exactly right to call for a probe on the scale of the 9/11 Commission to get to the bottom of what he calls an &quot;old-boy network&quot; and &quot;corruption.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in the terrorist attacks, the nation needs to find out who failed to see trouble coming and how they could have headed it off. From the very start the probe needs buy-in from top government officials, support the 9/11 panel never had. Investigators deserve pledges that their recommendations will be a guide for reform, not pooh-poohed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I promise you we will never put America in this position again,&quot; McCain said. It will be hard to fulfill that pledge until the failures have been exposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama disagrees, saying, &quot;This isn't 9/11.&quot; He argues that everything will be sunny again once the nation abandons Republican policies, but wrongly assumes Democrats have all the answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bipartisan investigation that looks deeply into the crisis would find blame on both sides of the aisle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lax oversight and easy credit have their roots as far back as the Clinton administration. In the mid-1990s, President Clinton told the Department of Housing and Urban Development to give more mortgages to low-income applicants. The government also raised mortgage loan limits. A news story at the time observed the change would &quot;stoke the already thriving home-sales market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And former Republican Sen. Phil Gramm, a McCain advisor until he accused Americans of whining about the economy, was a co-sponsor of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which knocked down the wall between commercial banks and investment banks. The legislation passed Congress with strong Democratic support and President Clinton signed it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gramm also championed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act a year later, which he said &quot;protects financial institutions from over-regulation.&quot; Unfortunately, it didn't protect taxpayers and investors, and should disqualify Gramm from any position in a possible McCain administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Game Plan Needed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is right to urge Congress to authorize the purchase of bad mortgage debt, which would be held until property values stop falling. It could be done through a temporary agency like the Resolution Trust Corp. that cleaned up the savings-and-loan disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government might even make money on some of the mortgages it would buy, and homeowners in foreclosure would be given more time to save their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Paul Volcker, Nicholas Brady and Eugene Ludwig laid out the challenge: &quot;The system is clogged with enormous amounts of toxic real-estate paper that will not repay according to its terms. This paper, in turn, is unable to support huge quantities of structured financial instruments, levered as much as 30 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until there is a new mechanism in place to remove this decaying tissue from the system, the infection will spread, confidence will deteriorate further and we will have to live through the mother of all credit contractions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker is a former head of the Federal Reserve. Brady is a former head of the Treasury. Ludwig is a former comptroller of the currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their counterparts in office seem inclined to follow their advice. So far, the Treasury and Federal Reserve have reacted quickly and effectively. Their leaders seem to have piloted us safely through the worst turbulence. But taxpayers are left holding huge stakes in shaky mortgage and investment markets and want to know, who flew us into this hurricane and how do we make sure we never get here again?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most leaders are focusing on how to stabilize markets and restore confidence. Their job will be incomplete without an honest inquiry into whether the economy's foundations remain fundamentally sound.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lowry Park Zoo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read the article about Lowry Park Zoo in the paper Sept. 16 (Iorio, zoo chief to meet) with some concern. Zoo president Lex Salisbury has done the city right with a venue that surpasses anything Tampa could imagine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think it is typical of a city administration that gets little done to criticize someone who is a go-getter. The mayor needs to stop playing politics and work to solve the problem. She should stand by Lex instead of throwing him under the bus. What he did may have been an indiscretion, but let's look at what he has done for the zoo over the years. Do you remember what it was like before Lex got here? What a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A better article might be why the city owns the animals considering private money supports a vast majority of the zoo's projects. Why isn't the zoo private at this point with a lease from the city? Why isn't the city working that kind of deal? It comes down to control. And now we will have more city control in the zoo. Not a good thing. Lex is a visionary, not a politician, and for that he should be commended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theodore J. Hamilton, Esq., Tampa </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Innovation brings success</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a shame during all of this media coverage of Lowry Park Zoo and Lex Salisbury's seeming conflict between his public job and personal business that no one reflects upon why the zoo is so successful. Perhaps it is because of the unusual approach Salisbury takes toward running the zoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Tom French's Zoo Story, published in your paper last year, most zoos receive up to 40 percent of their funding in tax dollars while Lowry Park Zoo receives 3 percent. Unusual relationships and new ideas have been the hallmark of Lowry Park Zoo and its operations. Admittedly, new concepts take time to accept, but it does not mean they are inherently corrupt or inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The zoo's board chairman approved of the relationship between Safari Wild and the zoo. Why is this newsworthy? If Safari Wild is not open for business, the structures are temporary (not built by taxpayer money) and hold only the zoo's animals, who benefits except the animals? Instead of admonishing Salisbury, we should be thanking him for his willingness to help animals with his personal resources. Caring for animals and running a fiscally responsible business is how Lowry Park Zoo went from being one of the worst zoos in the country to being one of the best. It is a shame our media have lost sight of that important issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monica Mancuso, Tampa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters must choose their economic philosophy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond all the political hoopla and theatrics that surround the upcoming U.S. presidential election, one critical question remains unanswered: How do the candidates propose to curb deficit spending and dig the government out of its financial hole?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1981, when Ronald Reagan began his first term as president, our national debt was just under $1-trillion. By the end of his second term, it had increased to nearly $3-trillion. During the administration of President George W. Bush, our debt has grown from $5-trillion to more than $9.6-trillion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How the results of this most crucial election will affect America's economy and, ultimately our pocketbooks, depends upon which of the respective political parties' fiscal policies is most sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican idea of cutting taxes for wealthy investors and big corporations, also known as &quot;trickle-down economics,&quot; is one choice. The idea is that, by lowering taxes, it is hoped that more money left in private hands will be invested in America. The shortfall, however, is that there is no guarantee the beneficiaries of these tax cuts will not decide to spend their money elsewhere. This, unfortunately, has become the reality. Instead of investing in and creating more jobs in America, many companies have found it more lucrative to export those jobs to cheaper foreign labor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, the Democrats' answer is to raise taxes, which, though not a popular option, may be the only viable short-term solution. The fact is it costs money to run a government. That money must come from somewhere: if not from taxes, it must be borrowed. Although we may prefer not to be taxed, simple logic would dictate that if the government must spend, it is better that it spend tax revenue than borrow more money and, consequently, burden future generations with taxes that will inevitably have to be paid, anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whichever candidate each of us decides to support, let us vote with our heads and not our emotions. Whether we personally favor one or the other, this election is not so much a choice of candidates as it is a choice between two fundamentally different economic policies, one which has twice proven to fail, the other which, under the dire circumstances we now find ourselves in, may be America's only hope for recovery, at least in the short run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Denny, St. Petersburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Try some evenhandedness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twice this week, your editorial page has decried the &quot;sleazy&quot; tactics employed by the McCain campaign, particularly in an ad that ties Barack Obama to a Illinois sex-education bill that included provisions for kindergarteners. If such tactics are beyond the pale, however, why haven't you made any mention of the appalling ads that the Obama campaign has been running?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just the other day, ABC News called out Obama for a Spanish-language ad that used inflammatory words to cast John McCain as anti-immigrant - when in fact McCain rankled conservatives with his soft approach to illegal immigration in that failed comprehensive bill last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or what about the ad that ridiculed McCain for not being able to send an e-mail or use a computer? If Obama staffers had bothered to do their research, they might have discovered that McCain's inability to type on a computer keyboard is the result of torture he suffered as a prisoner of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading the pages of the St. Petersburg Times, one would never know these things. Isn't it about time that you were a little more evenhanded with your outrage?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wildlife management</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter writer was critical of Sarah Palin's hunting wolves by air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I lived in Alaska for six years. Their are some caribou herds that are being decimated due to predation by wolves and bears. The wolf packs and bears are killing the newborn calves before they can evade the predators (within minutes of being born). The calving grounds are only accessible by air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I was there, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game stopped airborne hunting for a more humane way. The department decided to study the wolf packs, find the Alpha pair, dart them, then spay and neuter them in the field. The department figured that the wolf packs would eventually decline due to no more pups. What happened was that the Bravo pair took over and started having pups. This was at a tremendous cost with no effect on the calves being killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airborne hunt is not the most sporting hunt for sure. However it is a necessary tool to manage and save the caribou herd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Dowling, St. Petersburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's punch - Sept. 13, letter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigns need media</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter writer commented that Gov. Sarah Palin pretty well punched the media in the mouth when she said she was going to Washington to please the people of the United States, not to please the media. The writer stated, &quot;How refreshing to hear someone say that.&quot; This statement by Palin was like throwing &quot;red meat&quot; to the conservatives attending her speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I really don't think the writer or Palin understand the role of the media in our political process. If Palin gave her speech to prospective voters and the media didn't show up to report and to film the event for television and the print media, I can just imagine the howling and screaming that would take place. The campaigns need the media around all of the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A political commentator recently stated that when the campaigns put out a new advertisement that the other campaign doesn't like it isn't necessary to run the advertisement all over the country or for very long because the media pick it up as an issue and provide it to the public at no expense to the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What worries me the most is that so few voters read newspapers, watch serious news on television, or receive political news on the Internet from serious media sources. We are finding in this campaign season that too many people are acquiring their views from &quot;rock concert&quot; events consisting only of throwaway sound bites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul C. Blatt, Dunedin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Say no to the nanny state</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comes word recently that the Los Angeles City Council is banning for one year any new fast food restaurants in low-income sections of that city in the hope of attracting healthier menu alternatives, so as to combat the above-average incidence of obesity in these neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's another in a long line of attempts by government at all levels and in all areas of the country to insert the &quot;nanny state&quot; into our daily lives, as apparently we are incapable of exercising self-governance, parental prerogative and personal discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please, Nanny. We are not a nation of toddlers. We don't need to depend on you all our lives. Leave us alone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time to get moving on curbside recycling - Sept. 18, editorial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recycling is for long-term good</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recycling is a necessity, not an option. Short- sighted St. Petersburg politicians like Mayor Rick Baker don't see the long-term effects of our wasteful ways. They would rather have Pinellas County return a surplus collected for garbage pickup than have curbside recycling. They argue less fuel would be used if each resident drove their car to a drop-off location than have county trucks provide curbside recycling. That's because very few residents drive their vehicles to recycling depots to drop off newspapers and bottles. Statistics from other cities show that recycling efforts increase dramatically if residents are provided curbside recycling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A portion of St. Petersburg's garbage has to go to a landfill instead of being incinerated. Landfills are not clean. Landfills require land purchases, operation, 30 years of long-term care after closing, are difficult to build on and often require expensive remediation efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With curbside recycling, a lot of our waste would be recycled, and landfills could become a thing of the past. The status quo will mean we continue to leave these monuments of waste to our children, a reminder of how short-sighted politicians can be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Pryor, St. Petersburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make it mandatory</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curbside recycling should be available everywhere, and participation should be mandatory. Cut down trash pickup to one day a week, and add recycling one day a week. That takes care of the &quot;extra&quot; trip problem that Mayor Rick Baker is so afraid of. Once you start recycling, your actual trash volume decreases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cyndi Raskin Schmitt, Dunedin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not shady enough</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinellas County has a lot to learn about how best to negotiate a deal with St. Petersburg city leadership. What? No backroom meetings or hidden agenda, and city residents won't get stuck with some disguised expense? No wonder our city leadership is leery of their offer!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, Friday in Green Bay, Wis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The source for this data is the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which has compiled a list of which political leaders received the most money from employees of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Now Obama is No. 2 on the list, with $126,349, right after Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who had $165,400. But the list requires a few notes of explanation. Corporations cannot give to candidates so the center's list adds up contributions from Fannie and Freddie employees and their families. Obama has received a lot of money during his presidential campaign, though, and Fannie and Freddie don't make his list of top 20 companies. (The top three companies with employees donating to Obama are Goldman Sachs, University of California and Citigroup, according to the center.) There are other ways to parse the numbers, but McCain is correct when he says Obama got the second-most money on a list compiled by a respected, nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog. He would have been more accurate had he noted that he was talking about Fannie and Freddie employees. We rate his statement Mostly True.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deep worries about the economy are setting the stage for another presidential cliff-hanger in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new St. Petersburg Times/Bay News 9/Miami Herald poll shows a neck-and-neck race, with Republican John McCain backed by 47 percent of registered Florida voters surveyed, Democrat Barack Obama by 45 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once again, Florida is going to be a pivotal battleground in this election as it has been for the past two elections,'' said pollster Tom Eldon. &quot;Anyone who wrote Florida off as anything but a battleground state needs to turn in their pundit cards.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, 72, has a lead within the poll's margin of error and a double-digit advantage in terms of who Florida voters trust more as an effective commander in chief. But widespread economic worries make this must-win state for McCain well within reach for Obama, 47. (story here)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Returning to the city where John McCain said Monday that the &quot;fundamentals of the economy are strong,&quot; Barack Obama told 12,000 people (and up to 8,000 more outside the fence) in Jacksonville this afternoon that he is best equipped to get the country out of the economic meltdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- &quot;We can't steer ourselves out of this crisis with a driver who wants to go the same way -- into the ditch. And that's what this election is all about.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Marco Rubio, former speaker of the Florida House, predicted Republican presidential candidate John McCain will win the argument over which candidate can best right the economy because conservatives better understand the balancing act between too much regulation and too little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the nation's economic turmoil and the massive government intervention needed to shore up major financial institutions recently, Democrats have been accusing Republicans - including McCain - of having gone too far down the road to deregulation, and even Republicans on Capitol Hill seem prepared to tighten the reigns on Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubio insisted Florida voters will be drawn to the lure of the free market and less regulation than Obama would bring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida is a state composed of people who came here to get away from that,&quot; he said, be it from Cuba or New Jersey. &quot;They didn't just come for the weather.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of people are filling Metropolitan Park in Jacksonville in advance of Barack Obama's 2:30 p.m. appearance. A live ban plays tunes as a light breeze keeps the heat away. La.Trease Mallory, 36, showed up at 9 a.m. and still had to wait on a line hundreds of people long. &quot;This is amazing,&quot; she said, finally inside the park at 1 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Woooooweeee,&quot; Sen. Tony Hill, D-Jacksonville, opened his warm-up speech. &quot;Hold up your hands. Hold up your hands. Hold up your hands,&quot; he said. &quot;This election is in your hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers claim there are 12,000 people in the park, well beyond the 3,000 that showed up in Jacksonville Monday for John McCain. &quot;I don't know that Northeast Florida has ever turned out like you have today,&quot; Sen. Bill Nelson said. The crowd responded, &quot;Yes we can. Yes we can.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Buzz is that Barack Obama will be back in Florida next week, ensconced somewhere in Pinellas County, prepping for Friday's debate against John McCain. No word yet on where, but campaigns typically look for a place where they can get some privacy while at the same time easily generating media coverage in a critical battleground. John kerry was in Wisconsin in 04 and Al Gore was in Longboat Key in 00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those helping Obama prepare for the debate, the RPOF is happy to remind Miami-Dade residents, is Obama adviser Greg Craig, who represented Elian Gonzalez's father.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A proposal to ban gay marriage in the Florida Constitution is within striking distance of success, according to a new poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Petersburg Times/Bay News 9 survey shows 58 percent of voters approve the proposal to define marriage as between a man and woman. The poll, which was also underwritten by the Miami Herald, has a margin of error of 3.5 percent, meaning Amendment 2 has a shot at getting the 60 percent required to amend the state Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll showed 37 percent oppose the measure and 5 percent are undecided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We missed a great two-fer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush was supposed to help Republican congressional hopeful Tom Rooney on Thursday. But U.S. Rep. Tim Mahoney, who will face Rooney in the November election, threw rhetorical cold water on the president's visit by claiming to be &quot;shocked&quot; that Bush had time for a political fund-raiser during the current Wall Street crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not sure whether Mahoney's pre-visit criticism had any effect, but Bush did cancel his Florida trip, choosing instead to stay in Washington and restore investor confidence with his hands-on-the-tiller assurances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll continue to closely monitor the situation in our financial markets and consult with my economic advisers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oy. He should have come to Florida. It was a missed opportunity -- not only for Rooney, but for Bush too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issue after issue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me explain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rooney deserved to have a better fund-raiser than the one he got. First of all, the poor guy had to endure a three-way Republican primary that was basically a FetusFest, a contest among three nearly identical candidates pretending that the biggest concern in Florida's 16th Congressional District was hair-splitting over who hates abortion the most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Rooney's campaign decided to hold the Bush social in the home of a donor with unresolved tax issues. That wasn't going to work, so he had to find another home in the district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the Wall Street investment firm Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy over the weekend, Merrill Lynch dodged disaster with a distress sale to Bank of America, and the global insurance giant AIG socialized its collateral shortfalls with an $85 billion loan from U.S. taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How's a candidate supposed to raise $2,300 a head in an environment like this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Bush bailed at the last minute, dispatching Vice President Dick Cheney from his undisclosed location to Rooney's event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk about a buzz kill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lehman CEO's house a better venue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this could have been avoided if Rooney relocated the party to another home in the district -- the home of Richard Fuld, the chief executive officer of Lehman Brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fuld has a five-bedroom oceanfront compound on Jupiter Island, a place he bought four years ago for $13.75 million cash. And he also has a long history of donating money to both political parties. He has already donated to the campaigns of John McCain and Barack Obama, and four years ago, he gave to both Bush and John Kerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rooney would have been wise to tap into such an omnidirectional fountain of cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure, Fuld's shares of Lehman stock aren't worth much anymore. But he did have $22 million in a retirement fund and a total compensation of nearly a half-billion dollars at Lehman over the past 15 years. There are still many golden crumbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most of all, it would have allowed Bush to come to Florida. Instead of hunkering with referees on the sidelines, Bush could have rubbed shoulders with a former campaign contributor who has been a front-line player in the current financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In between posing for $7,500 photos with donors, Bush could have heard from Fuld about how packaging flimsy mortgage loans into bonds caused a tainted investment market. Fuld even might have suggested the sort of regulatory oversight that Bush might consider now that he has taken a sudden interest in reining in Wall Street.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin is billed on the John McCain ticket as another maverick who will fight for truth, another outsider who will fight the establishment, another reformer who will fundamentally change government. But that Sarah Palin doesn't exist. She's an invention of the increasingly dishonest McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refusing to answer questions is key to preserving that false image. This week, Gov. Palin's handlers pressed that tactic hard, announcing that she is &quot;unlikely to cooperate&quot; with the special prosecutor appointed by the Alaska Legislature to investigate her firing of a state administrator. It's stonewalling, plain and simple. The case could show conclusively that Gov. Palin is not the people's champion of small-town values but a vicious practitioner of small-time payback. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Palin is accused of firing Alaska's public safety commissioner because he wouldn't fire the state trooper whose marriage to her sister ended in a divorce and custody fight. A maverick fighting for truth and reform would confront and refute the evidence, which includes a recording in which a Palin aide clearly pressures a Public Safety Department official to get rid of the governor's former brother-in-law. There is ample evidence that other aides and the governor's husband also pressured the department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two months ago, Gov. Palin promised to cooperate with the investigation. But now vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin wants to shove the mess past Election Day, while the McCain campaign runs on double standards and deception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While constructing the &quot;Myth of Sarah,&quot; the tough lady who could field dress a moose, the McCain campaign simultaneously and incongruously tried to portray her as a fragile victim of a sexist inquisition by the media. She gave no interviews until aides could pack her head full of the talking points that embellished the myth: She said &quot;no thanks&quot; to the &quot;Bridge to Nowhere,&quot; then killed it; she'd root out those terrible earmarks; she put that state plane on eBay because she doesn't rip off the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Sarah Palin campaigned for that infamous bridge while running for governor, then &quot;killed&quot; it only after the criticism wouldn't let up. She then kept the money for Alaska. As mayor, she requested millions in earmarks after hiring a lobbyist with ties to now-indicted Sen. Ted Stevens, and she continued to pursue earmarks as governor. As governor, she charged taxpayers for time spent at her home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Articles this week in The New York Times and The Washington Post reveal that when she became mayor of tiny Wasilla, Gov. Palin fired the town attorney who enforced rules that stopped a friend from building a home. She fired the town museum's director and bullied the three ladies who worked there into resigning. She asked the librarian about banning books, fired her, then reinstated her after an outcry. She hired a manager for day-to-day administrative chores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As governor, she repeated the pattern, hiring friends -- at least five from high school, &quot;often at salaries far exceeding their private sector wages&quot; -- and rooted out and fired anybody she considered disloyal. She played the outsider card to get elected, but then installed her own set of unqualified insiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While insisting that Gov. Palin be immune from scrutiny, the McCain campaign and its allies have attacked Barack Obama with ads that even Karl Rove said were over the top. One ad falsely accused Sen. Obama of advocating sex education for kindergartners. Another ad accused Sen. Obama of &quot;completely false&quot; attacks on Gov. Palin and cited the nonpartisan Web site factcheck.org. That ad also was a lie. Factcheck.org was referring to &quot;completely false&quot; attacks by others, not the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lies to embellish the Sarah Palin Myth and the lies about Sen. Obama have turned Sen. McCain's &quot;straight-talk&quot; promise into the biggest lie of the campaign.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statewide telephone poll of 800 registered Florida voters was conducted Sunday through Wednesday this week, with a margin of error of 3.5 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters were more optimistic when asked what they expect of their personal economic situation in the next year: 46 percent said they expect it to stay about the same, 35 percent said it will get better. Just 14 percent expected it to get worse.</SPAN></P>

No wonder, then, that demagogues like Hugo Chavez have stepped into this vacuum. His predictable yet perilous mix of anti-American rhetoric, authoritarian government, and checkbook diplomacy offers the same false promise as the tried and failed ideologies of the past. But the United States is so alienated from the rest of the Americas that this stale vision has gone unchallenged, and has even made inroads from Bolivia to Nicaragua. And Chavez and his allies are not the only ones filling the vacuum. While the United States fails to address the changing realities in the Americas, others from Europe and Asia - notably China - have stepped up their own engagement. Iran has drawn closer to Venezuela, and just the other day Tehran and Caracas launched a joint bank with their windfall oil profits.&quot; [ Obama Speech, 5/23/08: (http://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=1042452803&amp;msgid=30858034&amp;act=JRD2&amp;c=106775&amp;admin=0&amp;destination=http%3A%2F%2Fmy.barackobama.com%2Fpage%2Fcommunity%2Fpost%2Fsamgrahamfelsen%2FgGCMCY)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama held a press conference at the University of Miami BankUnited Center, during which he spoke generally about what he believed an emergency plan for the economy needs to include.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he wanted to give U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson time to release the administration's detailed plan before he makes any suggestions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that it's critical that they have confidence their work might not be impeded by partisan rankling,&quot; Obama said. &quot;I'm much less interested in scoring political points than I am in making sure we have something in place that will work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, Obama took a few swipes at the Republican Party during the press conference that lasted more than half an hour: &quot;We did not arrive at this point by an accident in history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he strongly believes that any such plan should be temporary, include cooperation with other &quot;G-20&quot; countries and also include an economic stimulus package for working-class families. He also thinks that any plan that includes bailouts should include some sort of backstop or mutual reciprocity, so nobody makes money off it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm truly offended by Palin,'' said 37-year-old Republican Philinia Lehr of Largo, a full-time mother with a nursing degree who voted for George Bush in 2004. Like Palin, she has five children and she doesn't buy that the Alaska governor can adequately balance her family and the vice presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're somebody's mom and what are you going to do, say, 'Excuse me, country, hold on?' ... She's preaching that she's this mom of the year and taking that poor little baby all over everywhere. And, you know, what she's doing to her 17-year-old daughter is just appalling.'' Lehr said she's bothered by the way Palin's pregnant daughter has been brought into the national spotlight.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember that pesky little problem with Indian gaming and the Florida Supreme Court tossing the compact Gov. Charlie Crist struck in secret with the Seminole Indian tribe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Bill McCollum does. Today he released this letter (http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/KGRG-7JMGUR/file$/HogenLetter.pdf) he sent to the chairman of the National Indian Gaming Commission insisting that he &quot;take action immediately to see that the Tribe ceases its illegal activity until a valid compact can be consummated with the State of Florida.&quot; His point: Those card games and Vegas-style slot machines at Seminole casinos are illegal after the court tossed the compact. The Seminole Hard Rock casino in Tampa has Vegas-style slots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Crist is taking a different tact. He's still hoping to get the Legislature to sign off on a state compact with the Seminoles. The big question: What will the feds do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UPDATE: Rep. Ray Sansom, the Destin Republican who's likely to be the next House speaker, issued a statement Friday endorsing McCollum's action. &quot;I fully support Attorney General McCollum's efforts to halt the Seminole Tribe's illegal gambling,&quot; said the statement from Sansom, a long-standing opponent of more gambling in Florida. &quot;If the tribe wants to work with the state to resolve the compact issue, the tribe must first comply with the laws of Florida and of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's unemployment rate got even worse in August, up 0.3 of a percentage point from July to 6.5 percent. That adds 27,000 people to the unemployment line in the time period and overall, 606,000 people are jobless out of a labor force of 9.3-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The August unemployment rate is the highest since January 1995, which was also 6.5 percent. The state's current unemployment rate is 0.4 of a percentage point higher than the national unemployment rate of 6.1 percent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Except it's sometimes not. McCain's image lets him get away with bending the truth.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, Sen. John McCain and his campaign have distorted Sen. Barack Obama's view on sex ed for kindergartners, issued bogus statements about the federal pork for Alaska sought by his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, and aired an ad in Spanish blaming Obama for killing an immigration reform bill last year, even though Obama and McCain were on the same side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a Republican presidential candidate whose campaign bus is the Straight Talk Express and who built his political persona on integrity, a candidate who ends town hall meetings by somberly promising, &quot;I will always tell you the truth,&quot; the flurry of falsehoods has been jarring even to some Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Democratic foes also hope it will prove damaging, but so far McCain has little reason to fear he may ruin his sterling reputation - thanks largely to his sterling reputation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent polls show McCain still leads Obama in the trust department. Political analysts and pollsters say they doubt he'll pay in November unless his campaign continues its course and Obama can undo years of political branding and portray McCain as untrustworthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A difficult task, regardless of the dustups of today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any candidate needs to fear the weight of public opinion and a consensus forming against them, but the McCain campaign is a long way from that point, in part because of his reputation for independence and straight talk,&quot; said Whit Ayres, a respected Republican pollster who is not affiliated with the campaign. &quot;They've got more room to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster and president of the Polling Co., said she believes it's tough for the Democrats to call McCain a liar and not look out of line, or even face a backlash. After all, McCain, 72, is a Vietnam War hero who has built a strong reputation after three decades in Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With 50 days to go, it's going to be very difficult to undo the man's reputation for honestly, integrity, veracity and plain-spokenness that he's built up, jeez, dating back to Vietnam,&quot; said Conway, whose clients include the St. Petersburg Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and his campaign, of course, have told some whoppers as well, unfairly characterizing McCain's support for corporate tax cuts as special breaks for the oil industry, taking out of context McCain's comments about how long America may need troops in Iraq and besmirching McCain's record on gas mileage standards. This week, Obama exaggerated his role in crafting the economic stimulus package that passed Congress this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in volume and vigor, Team McCain of late is playing at a much higher level, repeating falsehoods almost daily about Palin's record, particularly, as well as Obama's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The McCain campaign has lost its moral authority to complain about unfair advertising,&quot; former McCain adviser Mike Murphy said Tuesday on MSNBC's Morning Joe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not surprisingly, Obama's campaign, along with Democrats generally, is sputtering. It is difficult to keep up with the avalanche of press releases featuring news clips debunking various claims from the McCain campaign, from McCain's assertion that as governor of Alaska Palin did not seek federal earmarks (false) to Palin's continued insistence that as governor she oversees 20 percent of the nation's domestic oil and gas production (also false).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ron Bonjean, a veteran Republican consultant in Washington, said that one reason McCain appears undamaged is that he's not stopping to engage Obama on every disputed attack. Instead, he and other analysts said, the Republicans are trying to quickly exploit what they see as vulnerabilities in Obama's message and image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be questions on his statements from time to time, but instead of allowing the media to bog down the McCain campaign with a parsing of the statements, they just move forward,&quot; Bonjean said. &quot;And it's smart for them to do, because the velocity of the campaign is too strong to stop and try to make course corrections. You just have to keep moving on to the next media cycle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to what voters like most about McCain, Republican, Democratic and nonpartisan pollsters alike cite words like &quot;integrity,&quot; &quot;honesty&quot; and &quot;straight talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Suffolk University poll out this week found that McCain leads Obama by 4 percentage points in the battleground state of Ohio, thanks largely to what pollster David Paleologos calls the trust gap: Although Ohioans said Obama is better equipped to deal with the economy and other important domestic issues, 49 percent trust McCain more, compared with 41 percent who trust Obama more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An eight-point differential in a key state like Ohio tells me a lot about what the baseline strength of McCain's persona is, and where Obama needs to go,&quot; said Paleologos, director of the Political Research Center at Suffolk University in Boston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because trust is such a fundamental part of McCain's appeal, pollsters and analysts said his candidacy would be at risk if voters perceive he's not delivering straight talk. While that doesn't appear to have happened, that doesn't mean it can't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Karl Rove, who as President Bush's campaign manager in 2004 helped dismantle Democratic Sen. John Kerry's reputation as a war hero and statesman, suggested that McCain may want to dial it back a bit. &quot;McCain has gone in some of his ads ... one step too far, and sort of attributing to Obama things that are, you know, beyond the 100 percent truth test,&quot; Rove said on Fox News Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't give Obama a pass, either, saying, &quot;Both campaigns are making a mistake, and that is they are taking whatever their attacks are and going one step too far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain charge generating the most guffaws came over Obama's use of the phrase &quot;you can put lipstick on a pig - it's still a pig.&quot; It's a common political line, and Obama was clearly referring to McCain's argument that he represents change. But in the wake of Palin's oft-repeated joke about how the only difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is &quot;lipstick,&quot; the McCain campaign released an ad claiming that Obama had slyly called Palin a pig.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet in Jacksonville on Monday, when reporters asked McCain if he really thought Obama had called Palin a pig, he said No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then McCain defended his advertisement anyway. &quot;But I know he chooses his words carefully and it was the wrong thing to say. ... I didn't like it, so we responded.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's early opposition to the Iraq war helped drive him to victory in the Democratic primaries. But it's the economy that could put him in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dramatic collapse of such august financial institutions as Lehman Bros. and Merrill Lynch is reshaping more than Wall Street, it's recasting the landscape of the presidential election at a crucial time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After fumbling over how to respond to Sarah Palin mania, the Democratic nominee suddenly has a prime opportunity to regain momentum now that economic turmoil is front and center. But only if he can capitalize on it, which is anything but certain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last few weeks have been a whirlwind around these conventions, and the media's been focused quite honestly on trivial issues. But I think the events this last week have clearly cemented the economy as the singular issue,'' said Steve Schale, who is leading Barack Obama's campaign in Florida. &quot;The candidate at the end of the day that convinces the voters that they are the most credible on how to get the economy growing is going to be the candidate that wins.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats traditionally have an advantage on bread and butter economic issues, but it only underscores a fundamental weakness in Obama's candidacy that he has struggled to maintain a significant lead over McCain on the question of whom voters trust to fix the country's financial mess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the paid staffers and field offices Obama now claims, how many undecided voters actually know yet that Obama's tax plan would cut middle class Americans' taxes more than McCain's, according to every nonpartisan analysis? Or that Obama is the only candidate supporting a national catastrophic fund to ease Florida's property insurance crisis?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday the Obama campaign began airing a two-minute TV ad - an unusually long one - in Tampa Bay and other battleground areas with the candidate speaking directly into the camera:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Six hundred thousand Americans have lost their jobs since January. Paychecks are flat and home values are falling. It's hard to pay for gas and groceries, and if you put it on a credit card they've probably raised your rates. You're paying more than ever for health insurance that covers less and less,'' Obama says. &quot;This isn't just a string of bad luck. The truth is that while you've been living up to your responsibilities, Washington has not. That's why we need change. Real change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blah, blah, blah. Change. blah, blah, blah. Change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opening is there for Obama, but only if he stops channeling Adlai Stevenson and starts hitting people in the gut. The guy may give a great speech, but he has trouble connecting with people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the problems that Obama's had is his TV commercials. They just aren't memorable and don't seem to have much staying power,'' said David Johnson, former executive director of the Florida Republican Party. &quot;A lot of times the undecided voters aren't making their decision based on cerebral arguments. It comes from the heart - 'I trust you' - and right now voters are still shopping for whom they trust to fix this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain this week seemed to do his part to make Obama's case for him. One top economic adviser weirdly suggested that McCain had invented the BlackBerry, another said neither McCain nor any other presidential candidate was equipped to run a major corporation. Then there was the Republican nominee himself declaring on the day that Lehman Bros. capsized and the stock market tanked that the economy is &quot;fundamentally strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator later backpedaled to say he was referring to the strength of the American worker. That explanation may have been more convincing if he hadn't said the same thing about the strength of the economy repeatedly this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fundamentals of America's economy are strong,&quot; McCain said back in April, the same month he also said &quot;there's been great progress economically&quot; under the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That McCain remains so competitive in this terrible climate for Republicans is testament to his strength and the goodwill he has earned with voters. But his path to the White House always looked easier if national security, and not the economy, was the driving issue of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls are pointing to momentum shifting back toward Obama after he spent the last few weeks in Palin's shadow. A Time/CNN poll released Wednesday showed a tie race in all-important Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican nominee now is aggressively campaigning as a passionate advocate of more Wall Street regulation. Never mind that he has spent much of his career pushing for less regulation and that he named as his campaign co-chairman former Sen. Phil Gramm, who led the charge in 1999 to end Depression-era regulations of the financial industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next week, McCain and Obama meet for the first of three nationally televised debates, and nobody can understate the importance of those debates and their potential to shake up the race once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's turmoil assures that the economy will be central to the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to be breaking through big time from here on out,'' said Florida CFO Alex Sink, who supports Obama. &quot;With this financial crisis we're dealing with I know that Floridians are concerned, and they're going to turn their attention back to looking at the policies and the issues and the type of leader we need for the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam C. Smith can be reached at asmith@sptimes.com or (727)893-8241.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TV ads released Wednesday directly addressing the turmoil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, 'Foundation'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You, the American workers, are the best in the world. But your economic security has been put at risk by the greed of Wall Street. That's unacceptable. My opponent's only solutions are talk and taxes. I'll reform Wall Street and fix Washington. I've taken on tougher guys than this before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, 'Plan for Change'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reform our tax system to give a $1,000 tax break to the middle class instead of showering more on oil companies and corporations that outsource our jobs. End the 'anything goes' culture on Wall Street with real regulation that protects your investments and pensions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of their long-term economic plans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the housing crisis, he has proposed letting some delinquent mortgage-holders refinance at more affordable terms and wants a commission to examine the way loose credit practices triggered the current crisis. He would make the Bush tax cuts permanent, and trim the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. He also seeks to lower Medicare premiums and ban Internet and cell phone taxes. He emphasizes spending cuts by eliminating &quot;pork-barrel&quot; projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would create a $10-billion fund to help some homeowners avoid foreclosure. He proposes a $75-billion tax rebate to stimulate the economy. He wants a $500 tax credit that would reimburse workers for payroll taxes and would roll back the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest taxpayers. He also would increase the capital gains tax for individuals, but eliminate it for startup businesses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coker, a 17-year-old junior, is not old enough to vote, but she said that several issues brought up in this election intrigue her. &quot;Right now, my personal preference would be McCain,&quot; she said. She and her classmates also plan on attending an Obama rally if he comes back to Florida in the next couple of months.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can Obama ride economy into White House?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMN HERE (http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/state/article815919.ece). For all the paid staffers and field offices Obama now claims, how many undecided voters actually know yet that Obama's tax plan would cut middle class Americans' taxes more than McCain's, according to every nonpartisan analysis? Or that Obama is the only candidate supporting a national catastrophic fund to ease Florida's property insurance crisis?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday the Obama campaign began airing a two-minute TV ad - an unusually long one - in Tampa Bay and other battleground areas with the candidate speaking directly into the camera:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Six hundred thousand Americans have lost their jobs since January. Paychecks are flat and home values are falling. It's hard to pay for gas and groceries, and if you put it on a credit card they've probably raised your rates. You're paying more than ever for health insurance that covers less and less,'' Obama says. &quot;This isn't just a string of bad luck. The truth is that while you've been living up to your responsibilities, Washington has not. That's why we need change. Real change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blah, blah, blah. Change. Blah, blah, blah. Change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opening is there for Obama, but only if he stops channeling Adlai Stevenson and starts hitting people in the gut. The guy may give a great speech, but he has trouble connecting with people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the problems that Obama's had is his TV commercials. They just aren't memorable and don't seem to have much staying power,'' said David Johnson, former executive director of the Florida Republican Party. &quot;A lot of times the undecided voters aren't making their decision based on cerebral arguments. It comes from the heart - 'I trust you' - and right now voters are still shopping for whom they trust to fix this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Posted by Adam Smith at 9:40:38 AM on September 18, 2008</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama hit with 'Commitment vs. Rhetoric' ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee is welcoming Barack Obama to Florida with a Spanish language radio ad that attacks his work on the immigration bill. It will run Friday in Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama supported measures designed to insert a deadly 'poison pill' to kill the immigration legislation,&quot; a woman says. &quot;If Obama didn't even have the courage to stand up for immigrants, how can he claim to have the strength to change the way Washington works?&quot; (listen here (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b70Esj-C83w))</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But is it true?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politifact (http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/570/) examined the &quot;poison pill&quot; claim and found it half true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a fact that Obama's actions came at a critical point in the immigration debate and threatened a fragile political compromise. And he supported Sen. Byron L. Dorgan's amendment, which was considered the poison pill McCain describes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's not accurate to describe Obama's amendment in the same terms. It addressed what many experts viewed as a central component of any viable immigration reform package. McCain and his camp are exaggerating Obama's role by portraying him as a giant-slayer without offering any proof Obama was intent on killing the entire package.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right on the heels of Bank of America's deal Monday to buy Merrill Lynch, market rumors surfaced Tuesday that Washington Mutual could be bought out by JPMorgan Chase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while Wachovia and SunTrust Banks haven't faced nearly as much trouble as some other banks, the continued turmoil in the financial industry has raised takeover rumors about those companies in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, the fallout from the nation's credit crisis could have a big impact on Jacksonville. Over the past two decades, some of the nation's largest financial companies have moved into Jacksonville and established large operations centers. According to the Florida Agency for Workforce Innovation, about 60,000 people in the Jacksonville area work in &quot;financial activities,&quot; representing nearly 10 percent of all nonfarm jobs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the financial industry consolidates, a lot of those jobs could disappear as major firms merge and look to cut costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's going to be a loss of jobs because the mortgage industry is shrinking,&quot; said Ben Bishop, chairman of Jacksonville investment banking firm Allen C. Ewing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of America became interested in buying Merrill Lynch because of the firm's large brokerage business, analysts said. But beyond the brokerage operations, Bank of America might look at cutting a lot of Merrill Lynch's total workforce of about 60,000, said Mark Travis, chief executive of Intrepid Capital Management in Jacksonville Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That 60,000 head count - my guess is that they're going to cut it in half,&quot; Travis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's going to be painful,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merrill Lynch has a number of business units operating in Jacksonville, and it would not give specific data on which units employ the 2,700 people locally. But one of its major local operations is the headquarters of its mortgage company, Merrill Lynch Credit Corp. That business could be vulnerable, since Bank of America has its own mortgage operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It does seem likely there will be a significant overlap&quot; of some corporate functions between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, said John Challenger, chief executive of Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Challenger said Bank of America has been involved in a lot of acquisitions and has been known to cut jobs after a merger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has built a real machine. It has a model and an approach,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Challenger's firm keeps track of daily job-cut announcements. He said the financial sector has already shed about 103,000 workers nationally this year, and this week's news of the Merrill Lynch takeover and the collapse of Lehman Brothers could lead to more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A year-end spike in financial cuts, ignited by these latest actions, could send 2008 job cuts in the sector past the 2007 record total of 153,105,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington Mutual has been the subject of intense speculation for the past week after it fired its chief executive amid continuing loan losses. Its stock, which has dropped more than 80 percent this year, fell to $1.50 Tuesday morning, its lowest level in more than 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A merger with JPMorgan Chase would certainly have an impact on local jobs, since both companies' Jacksonville operations focus on the mortgage business. But Bishop said it's difficult to say if takeover rumors about any banking firm are true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's just pure speculation because nobody knows,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite some loan losses, Wachovia and SunTrust are in better shape than other financial institutions. So Bishop said it's less likely that those banks would be takeover targets in the current market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news isn't all bad for Jacksonville. German-based Deutsche Bank revealed plans in July for a business support center in Jacksonville that will employ 1,000 people by 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop, who has been following the banking industry for more than 30 years at Allen C. Ewing, thinks Jacksonville is in the second year of a three-year down cycle in the financial industry. He's expecting the industry to begin recovering around the spring of next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll get through this. But it's not very fun in the meantime,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day after taking heat for saying &quot;the fundamentals of our economy are strong,&quot; Republican presidential nominee John McCain told a rally here Tuesday that the U.S. is in a &quot;bad economy&quot; and pinned much of the blame on Wall Street excesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With turmoil in the financial markets dominating the political discourse this week, McCain delivered a populist attack on Wall Street, saying American workers have been &quot;put at risk by the greed and mismanagement of Wall Street and Washington. The top of our economy is broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is time to set things right, and I promise to get the job done as your president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Democrat Barack Obama's campaign criticized McCain, who has favored less regulation of business in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain thinks the 'fundamentals of our economy are strong,' and he's been a big supporter of the deregulation agenda that helped cause this problem in the first place,&quot; said Bobby Gravitz, Obama's South Florida communications director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain wrapped up a two-day Florida swing by speaking to a crowd of about 2,500 at the Tampa Convention Center. When McCain spoke of the financial crisis in Jacksonville on Monday, he said there was &quot;turmoil&quot; and that people are &quot;frightened,&quot; then added that &quot;the fundamentals of our economy are strong but these are very, very difficult times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama camp pounced, saying McCain's &quot;fundamentals&quot; remark showed him to be &quot;disturbingly out of touch with what's going in the lives of ordinary Floridians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain on Tuesday offered a bleaker assessment of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The worst thing we can do in this bad economy -- and it is a bad economy -- is raise people's taxes,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said government has a responsibility to protect savings, Individual Retirement Accounts, 401(k) plans and pension accounts. He called for unspecified reforms to rein in &quot;excess&quot; severance packages for corporate executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also lashed the &quot;casual oversight&quot; by various federal regulatory agencies and pledged greater scrutiny of disclosure requirements for complicated and risky investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blasting of Wall Street was an unusual talk for a Republican, said Scott Davis of Tampa, a commercial mortgage banker who listened to the speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pendulum's swung so far to the side of Wall Street being out of control that maybe measures that are more drastic than a normal Republican, free-market person would apply are appropriate,&quot; Davis said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In Tampa, the GOP candidate calls for an overhaul of regulation.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only in a topsy-turvy presidential election like this one would thousands of ardent Republicans cheer for more government regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that was precisely the scene Tuesday at the Tampa Convention Center as Republican presidential candidate John McCain campaigned as a populist crusader against greed and lax government oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to put an end to the reckless conduct, corruption and unbridled greed that have caused a crisis on Wall Street,'' McCain told more than 2,000 people who gathered for his first Tampa Bay campaign rally since winning Florida's primary in January. &quot;Let me give you some straight talk: The top of our economy is broken. We have seen self-interest, greed, irresponsibility and corruption undermine the hard work of the American people. It is time to set things right.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid collapsing financial institutions and wild fluctuations in the stock market, the economy has pushed pigs, lipstick and Sarah Palin's record into the background as both McCain and Democrat Barack Obama scramble to convince voters that they understand the economic anxiety permeating the electorate and are best equipped to deal with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, 72, faced criticism Monday for saying in Jacksonville the &quot;fundamentals of the economy are strong,&quot; but in Tampa on Tuesday he stressed to the enthusiastic crowd that by fundamentals he meant the American worker. And in a series of TV interviews, he called for a commission to examine the causes of the country's financial mess, much like the 9/11 Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Colorado on Tuesday, Obama dismissed that as passing the buck and said a McCain presidency would amount to a continuation of the Bush administration's economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you want to understand the difference between how Sen. McCain and I would govern as president, you can start by taking a look at how we've responded to this crisis,'' Obama, 47, said. &quot;Because Sen. McCain's approach was the same as the Bush administration's - support ideological policies that made the crisis more likely, do nothing as the crisis hits and then scramble as the whole thing collapses.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is better known for national security, but is ceding no ground on the economy, the top concern of voters. The Arizona senator also generally has been a deregulation advocate - and Democrats note his former top economic adviser, former Sen. Phil Gramm, in 1999 led the charge to deregulate the financial industry - but he drew cheers Tuesday by calling for greater regulation of Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Too many firms on Wall Street have been able to count on casual oversight by regulatory agencies in Washington. And there are so many of those regulators that the responsibility for oversight is scattered, unfocused and ineffective,'' said McCain, whose 17-minute speech was interrupted at times by chants of &quot;USA! USA!&quot; and &quot;Drill, baby, drill!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Among others, we've got the SEC, the CFTC, the FDIC, the SPIC and the OCC. But for all their big and impressive sounding names, the fact is they haven't been doing their job right, or else we wouldn't have these massive problems on Wall Street,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tampa Bay is the biggest battleground region in Florida, and McCain has spent limited time here since winning Florida's Republican primary Jan. 29. In April, he made a health care speech at the University of South Florida while in the area for a private fundraiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was joined Tuesday on stage by his wife, Cindy, and former Gov. Bob Martinez, Sen. Mel Martinez and former U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp, who ran for vice president with Bob Dole in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real crowd-drawer on the Republican ticket, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, did not join McCain in Florida, but enthusiasm for her was clear among the crowd snapping up Palin campaign buttons and wielding signs like &quot;Vote 4 Trig's mom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin is expected to make her first Florida campaign appearance Sunday at the Villages, a Republican stronghold in north-central Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Alan, 35, of Tampa wore a shirt declaring &quot;Sarah Palin Is My Homegirl&quot; and carried a sign that read &quot;McCain Palin Foshizzle.&quot; Palin shows the GOP is not just a party of &quot;old, white, crusty people,&quot; said Alan, who is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dianna Peffly, a 40-year-old registered Democrat from Seminole, signed up at the rally to volunteer for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was a big Clinton supporter,&quot; she said of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. &quot;And I really love Sarah Palin, and everything she stands for. Together they make a great team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the rally McCain stopped at the South Tampa home of Republican media consultant Adam Goodman, where he filmed a commercial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN/Time (http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/): &quot;New polls in five battleground states that could decide the presidency suggest the battle for the White House between Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama remains a dead heat. The CNN/Time Magazine/Opinion Research Corp. polls, out Wednesday, indicate that the race for Florida, and its 27 electoral votes, is tied up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bob Barr, Ralph Nader and Cynthia McKinney are added to the choices, the Sept. 14-16 poll has it Obama 48 percent, McCain 44 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And 67 percent of Florida voters support expanded offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walking down College Ave this afternoon, on his way to a press conference about renewable energy, lobbyist Michael Dobson was as friendly as ever. He even thanked a reporter for writing about his dubious effort (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/2008/04/lobbyist-ripped.html) to get a vanity license plate approved last session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You did me a favor,&quot; he said, adding he will no longer work on specialty plates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the stink has not cleared. This afternoon, House lawyer Jeremiah Hawkes wrote a letter (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/dobson.pdf) to Speaker Marco Rubio saying a preliminary investigation found probable cause that Dobson engaged in unregistered lobbying and &quot;fraudulent representation&quot; before a committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These violations are not de minimus,&quot; Hawkes wrote. &quot;Mr. Dobson has been a registered lobbyist for years and is aware of the requirements to lobby. Mr. Dobson was given an opportunity to respond to this investigation, and failed to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, the Florida Commission on Ethics fined Dobson's firm $5,000 for not filing a disclosure form last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 70 statewide and local groups have banded together to promote passage of Amendment 4 on the November ballot. This one hasn't received a lot of attention. It's the so-called Conservation Amendment that offers a property tax exemption for landowners who agree to permanently keep land off-limits to development. (The groups have a political committee, Citizens for Conservation Land, and their pro-Amendment 4 Web site is www.amendment4florida.com (http://www.amendment4florida.com/).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference in Tallahassee, the Florida Wildlife Federation, Nature Conservance, Audubon of Florida and Florida Chamber of Commerce were joined by Jim Fowler, the former host of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom and a long-time advocate for land conservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chamber's Adam Babington spoke of &quot;a necessary balance between growth and conservation&quot; in Florida. The St. Petersburg Times has more background (http://www.sptimes.com/2008/01/31/State/Untouched_and_untaxed.shtml) on how the amendment came to be.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's campaign put out a little video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Bj1KX_GabQ) this afternoon that is intended to pull in money for the homestretch. And campaign manager David Plouffe has an arresting price tag on winning Florida: $39 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our fight in the battleground states is going to be tougher than a lot of you may think,&quot; he says. &quot;Take Florida, where George Bush won by just 381,000 votes in 2004. The campaign we're running there is going to cost more than $39 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama sales pitch is more common these days, perhaps indicating that his decision to pass up federal funds may not be working to design. It also speaks to the post-Palin surge McCain has seen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic CFO Alex Sink blasted John McCain over the economy on a conference call with reporters today, seizing on his &quot;the fundamentals are strong&quot; comment from Monday: &quot;I just had to ask myself which cabbage patch he's been living in. Because anybody who's out there talking to real people and looking at statistics and numbers like I like to do, knows that the fundamentals of our economy are in trouble. ...We can't have another president who is so incredibly out of touch with what's going on in real America,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what about McCain on Tuesday promising tougher regulation and reform of Wall Street? &quot;John McCain has been in Washington for 26 years. Where has he been and what has he been doing? It's a little late, isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politico (http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13516.html): &quot;A Republican group is taking responsibility for a poll that has roiled the Jewish community by asking sharply negative questions about Senator Barack Obama. The Republican Jewish Coalition, which is launching a campaign against Obama on behalf of Senator John McCain, sponsored the poll to &quot;understand why Barack Obama continues to have a problem among Jewish voters,&quot; the group's executive director, Matt Brooks, told Politico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;...&quot;The fact that the Republican Jewish Coalition is targeting Jewish Americans with these disgraceful and deceitful tactics fits in perfectly with the dishonorable campaign that John McCain has chosen to run. Peddling lies and hateful distortions to scare Jewish voters is reprehensible and deeply disrespectful to Jewish Americans,&quot; said Florida Congressman Robert Wexler, an Obama supporter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican and Democratic U.S. House members from Florida are urging Florida's U.S. senators, Democrat Bill Nelson and Republican Mel Martinez, to make sure the Senate votes to extend the sales-tax deduction granted to residents of states that don't have income taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to the senators Wednesday, Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite, R-Brooksville, and twelve colleagues from both parties write, &quot;As the end of this legislative session draws near, we are increasingly concerned about the expiration of the state sales tax deduction. We respectfully ask that you do everything possible to urge the Senate leadership to include the state sales tax deduction in any legislation that will be signed into law before the end of this session.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extension would allow taxpayers from Florida and several other states to write off a portion of the state sales taxes they pay. The idea is to give them the same sort of tax benefit as residents of states with state income taxes, which are deductible from one's federal tax bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have heard from constituents who are increasingly concerned about whether or not they will be able to use this deduction,&quot; the representatives wrote. &quot;Extending the deduction will act as a direct stimulus to Florida's ailing economy. Providing Florida residents with the assurance of an extension of the state sales tax deduction will let our constituents make decisions about their future - including major purchases that can stimulate our economy, such as cars, appliances, and home renovations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House has passed a bill extending the tax deductions. The Senate voted against limiting debate on a bill including the measure back in July, effectively killing it for the time being. Congress is expected to adjourn at the end of next week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee paid for a mass mailing to older Florida Democratic voters, noting that their party affiliations were &quot;unconfirmed&quot; and saying: &quot;We have you registered as a Republican. Is this still correct?&quot; Democratic voters in Tampa, Jacksonville, Naples and Spring Hill report getting the mailing over the past two weeks, which the RNC calls &quot;simply a fund-raising piece.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the envelope carries a &quot;do not forward&quot; instruction to the Postal Service, some Democrats suspect that the GOP is creating a database of voters whose addresses can't be verified so that their eligibility to vote can be questioned (this is known as &quot;vote caging.&quot;) Secretary of State Kurt Browning doesn't think much of this Republican direct-mail tactic either.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The e-mail that caused panic at the pump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the e-mail that ricocheted around state employees' in-boxes last Friday and is being blamed for helping trigger a panic at the pump that forced many Tallahassee-area stations to quickly run dry. Its author is an unidentified secretary at the Department of Management Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As many of you know, I work within the Department of Management Services. The Office of Efficient Government are next door to my office. They received an urgent message concerning the gas prices. They were told that by this afternoon, gas will go up $1 (yes, you heard me right) from its current price, due to Hurricane Ike hitting the Texas area. They are planning to shut down all the oil pumps/wells. The hurricane is due to hit this weekend (supposedly Saturday morning). So if your finances permit, you may want to take a few extra minutes at lunch and fill up. Just wanted to let you all know. If I hear anything else, I will let you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Speaker race 2014: Game on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over lunch today in Jacksonville, the furtive race for House Speaker 2014 (That's right, 2014. Twenty fourteen.) reaches to another level when a Republican yet to win his first election holds court with House leadership during a fundraiser at Zurich Insurance Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Weinstein will play host along with Speaker-designate Ray Sansom and his would-be successors Dean Cannon (2010) and Will Weatherford (2012). Weinstein, who is likely to replace term-limited Dick Kravitz, has been quietly positioning himself (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/2008/03/mr-speaker-of-t.html) for the title and his prominence in the fundraiser confirms he is a player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he has competition. As word of the fundraiser spread, Rep. Chris Dorworth of Lake Mary reportedly stepped up his own efforts to assert himself as the best man for the job. Fellow lawmakers say they got calls over the weekend asking them to pledge support to Dorworth. &quot;Everything was flying hard and fast,&quot; one rep told the Buzz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The darkhorse is Rep. Clay Ford of Pensacola. Ford has a more subtle style but benefits from having arrived in the House in February 2007, after Rep. Holly Benson got tapped by Gov. Charlie Crist to run the Department of Business and Professional Regulation. Dorworth landed his seat in November of that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fundraiser at Zurich, run by Jacksonville Jaguars part-owner Tom Petway, is for a handful of would-be state reps in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reached Tuesday evening, Weinstein acknowledged he is helping play host but said he would not be using the venue to advance his campaign for speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will not ask anyone tomorrow for a pledge,&quot; he said, adding that if the subject comes up he will say he is interested but does not want to discuss it now. &quot;It's kind of silly to be thinking about and discussing it before an election and before you get to know everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of the early jockeying bemoan term limits, while contestants say the eight-year limit puts time at a premium. Still, as was Weatherford (http://www.sptimes.com/2007/02/08/State/Contest__for_2012_spe.shtml ) last year, the 2014 candidates are sheepish about publicly discussing their ambition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's kind of offensive and silly before you know your options,&quot; Weinstein said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course any option assumes Republicans will still control the Florida House of Representatives in 2014.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With financial markets reeling, Republican presidential nominee John McCain began a Florida campaign swing Monday by declaring that he and running mate Sarah Palin are a &quot;team of mavericks&quot; who will &quot;clean up Wall Street.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain made the pledge to a crowd of around 4,000 amid news of Lehman Brothers filing for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch agreeing to be sold to Bank of America. Last week the federal government seized troubled mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know that there's been tremendous turmoil in the financial markets and ... people are frightened by these events,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Still, the fundamentals of our economy are strong, but these are very, very difficult times. I promise you, we will never put America in this position again. We will clean up Wall Street,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama's campaign immediately pounced on McCain's assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today of all days, John McCain's stubborn insistence that the 'fundamentals of the economy are strong' shows that he is disturbingly out of touch with what's going in the lives of ordinary Floridians,&quot; said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hours later at an appearance in Orlando, McCain spoke of the &quot;fundamentals&quot; in a different way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American worker, the innovation, their entrepreneurship, the small business -- those are the fundamentals of America, and I think they're strong,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, McCain added, &quot;those fundamentals are being threatened today because of the greed and corruption that some engaged in on Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain called for stricter oversight, but no taxpayer bailouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alaska Gov. Palin campaigned separately in Colorado. Mentions of Palin's name drew big cheers at the Jacksonville rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign, meanwhile, noted that McCain drew a smaller audience in Jacksonville than the crowds he drew with Palin. The Jacksonville event, 4,000 people in a 15,000-seat arena, looked smaller and drew taunts of an &quot;enthusiasm gap&quot; from the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Jacksonville rally, in an interview with Florida reporters aboard his campaign bus, McCain said his call for tougher regulation of Wall Street is not inconsistent with his frequent calls for less government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope I'm not misquoting Teddy Roosevelt when he said 'Unfettered capitalism breeds corruption.' And so I am a free-market capitalist, a free-trader, all those things, but there's got to be oversight and regulation of these -- of the global economy that we're in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was accompanied in Jacksonville and Orlando by U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez; Gov. Charlie Crist; former Govs. Jeb Bush and Bob Martinez; and Jack Kemp, the 1996 GOP vice presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traveling with Florida's biggest GOP heavyweights and its future first lady, Republican presidential nominee John McCain seized on the number one issue for voters this election during the first of his two days of campaigning in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American economy is in crisis,&quot; McCain told about 300 voters Monday afternoon at a town hall meeting here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's Florida visit comes on the heels of a historic shakeup on Wall Street that culminated over the weekend with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, one of the nation's largest investment banks, and the sale of another major banking firm, Merrill Lynch. McCain told several thousand people at a Jacksonville rally Monday that despite the continuing troubles at the country's financial institutions &quot;the fundamentals of our economy are strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama's campaign pounced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It demonstrates how alarmingly out of touch Sen. McCain is on the status of our economy and how working families across the country are being challenged by our weakening economy,&quot; said Obama spokesman Josh Earnest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours later in Orlando, McCain retooled his comments, saying the country's economic fundamentals are strong but threatened. He defined &quot;fundamentals&quot; as American workers and small business entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economic crisis is not the fault of the American people,&quot; McCain said. &quot;Our workers are the most innovative, the hardest working, the best skilled, the most productive, the most competitive in the world... Those are the fundamentals of America and I think they're strong, but they are being threatened today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news from Wall Street was fresh on the minds of voters as they arrived at the Asociacion Borinquena de Florida Central, a Latino community center in Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those interviewed said Lehman Brothers' looming bankruptcy and Bank of America's purchase of Merrill Lynch - following the collapse of Bear Sterns earlier this year and the bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last week - deepened their concerns about the economy. They overwhelmingly thought the government should not use taxpayer money to rescue sinking private financial institutions - a sentiment McCain echoed Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they had money coming out their ears, they weren't crying for help,&quot; said Carlos Chardon, the executive director of the Republican Party of Puerto Rico. &quot;Why should we bail them out now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But undecided independent voter Jacqueline Barton, who is also against government bailouts, is still unsure if McCain offers the right approach on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll see,&quot; Barton, executive director of the Orlando Business Center, said. &quot;It would be nice if he laid forward a plan on putting our people back to work, keeping jobs here and how he would help small businesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barton said she was heartened by McCain's vice presidential choice, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She might be a good balance because she comes from middle class roots,&quot; Barton said, expressing concern that McCain could not recall the number of homes he owns when asked last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has repeatedly criticized McCain as out of touch with Americans when it comes to the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain took a few moments Monday to renew his call on Obama to travel the country with him so the two can hold town hall meetings and debate such issues. He also gave his signature vow to fight pork barrel spending in Washington. McCain was well received by the mostly Puerto Rican audience in Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Central Florida's Puerto Rican voters have traditionally supported Democrats, but Republicans have made inroads in recent years and clearly plan to fight for their support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin is expected to campaign in The Villages community in Central Florida on Sunday, while Obama's campaign will visit Miami on Friday and Jacksonville on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the events in Orlando and Jacksonville, McCain attended a fundraiser in Miami. His Florida swing ends today with a rally in Tampa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joining McCain on Monday were former governors Jeb Bush and Bob Martinez, U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez, as well as Gov. Charlie Crist, and his fiancee Carole Rome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush said he supports McCain because of his &quot;zeal for reform,&quot; his experience and his integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush was hired by Lehman Brothers last year as a consultant. Despite posting billions in losses, the 158-year-old financial institution did not slow its political activity this year. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Lehman employees and political committees have given $1.3 million to presidential candidates, making it the fourth-largest contributor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama received more than $370,000 from Lehman employees; McCain received about $117,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Crist urged attendees to help McCain win his state, which offers 27 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said he would give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit they could use to get health insurance policies that best suit them. He advocated building 45 nuclear plants by 2030, which he said would create 700,000 new jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called the housing crisis the root of the financial problems facing firms such as Lehman Brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real turnaround will be when that shakes out,&quot; said McCain, who advocates that the government guarantee homeowners to secure 30-year mortgages with the Federal Housing Administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain touched on issues important to Puerto Rican voters, saying he would sign a bill to give statehood to the U.S. territory. Puerto Rico's political status is the key reason Chardon supports McCain and flew in for his Florida campaign swing to hand out pamphlets entitled &quot;Puerto Rico: the Case for the 51st State.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers' income doesn't reflect results - Sept. 13, story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I often wonder why some people are so bent on assessing teachers' salaries based solely on their students' performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do people have any idea how many students we get at school who not only have self-esteem issues, but are also dealing with situations at home many of us could not imagine? Not only do we become counselors and mentors, but often we also have to take very misguided young minds and try to help them make sense of things they are dealing with outside of the classroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, a particular teacher may be the only reason a child comes to school every day, and it may be simply because that child knows his teacher cares about him and really wants to help him achieve some of his life goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's start celebrating the fact that many of our children are so deeply influenced in a positive way by some of their teachers that they go on to live lives they might possibly have missed out on because of their experiences outside of the classroom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you must evaluate us, talk to our students along with all the other assessment techniques you use. The one teacher who may not have increased her students' test scores may be the one teacher who helped her students learn how to live a successful and peaceful life. How do we put a price tag on that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Janet Whedon, Clearwater</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers' income doesn't reflect results Sept. 13, story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quality of learning begins in the home</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am so disgusted by the ongoing debate regarding merit pay. I have a master's degree in multicultural/bilingual education and I have taught at the elementary school level for 10 years. I go in early, I bring work home, and I do my best to help every student in my room achieve academic success. What logic is there in basing my pay on whether or not my students do well?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider doctors and dentists. Should a doctor's pay be based on the health of his patients? Should a dentist's pay be based on how many cavities his patients have? Doctors and dentists cannot control what their patients do outside of their offices. A doctor may encourage his patient to eat well, avoid smoking, and take up exercise, but that patient may go home and continue to eat junk, smoke cigarettes, and sit on the couch. Is it the doctor's fault?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have no control over what my students may experience outside of my classroom: poor diet, insufficient sleep, hours of TV watching and video game playing, inadequate discipline, misguided values, and a lack of instruction in manners. When those same students perform poorly on tests, should my pay be determined from those results?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am not only a teacher; I am also a parent of a Pinellas County student. My child is successful in school because I know where academic success begins: in the home! Until all children come to school ready to learn, good teachers will continue to see poor test results in some students, despite all the efforts of those teachers in the classroom. Place the responsibility for achievement where it must start: with the parents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers' income doesn't reflect results Sept. 13, story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A flawed measure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is no surprise that a master's degree or years of experience do not correlate precisely with the quality of a teacher, this article's analysis is still faulty. This article could more accurately have been titled &quot;Students' test scores don't reflect teacher quality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal mistake is equating merit bonuses with teacher quality. These bonuses are based on test scores and evaluations. Evaluations are very subjective, and test scores, as we all should know by now, reflect the socioeconomic status of the students more than anything else. This year, Hillsborough school officials had to separate Title I teachers from the rest when considering the bonuses because noticeably fewer teachers in high-poverty schools got the bonuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to see another analysis after the bonuses are distributed this year: How many teachers who got the merit bonus last year got it again? Was there a strong continuity, or was it, as many of us suspect, merely a crapshoot?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opportunistic sellers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It never ceases to amaze me how the possibility of any natural disaster raises the price of gasoline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gas station I go to raised prices on gas 25 cents per gallon in one day. I can understand any increase had a tanker truck delivered gas at a cost higher than the previous shipment. However this apparently was not the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does the price of gasoline previously delivered and in the underground tanks jump 25 cents a gallon when no new gasoline has been received? To me this is a retailer who is being opportunistic and price gouging the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such businesses should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's distortions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its recent editorial, the St. Petersburg Times conveniently omitted the egregious distortions and inflations made by the Barack Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama camp shamefully and incorrectly asserted that John McCain wanted to continue the Iraq war for 100 years. It was patently clear (to anyone who cared to read the statement in context) that McCain meant he would accept some type of military presence in Iraq - similar to what we have in Kuwait, Korea or Germany - so long as American troops are not being attacked, injured or killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the Obama campaign advertisements distorting McCain's statement that the economy is &quot;fundamentally sound&quot;? The ads again take his words out of context, and they omit McCain's repeated acknowledgement that hard-working American families are hurting and that times are indeed very tough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Sierra, Tampa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign of lies disgraces McCain - Sept. 14, editorial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain out of control</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've always believed McCain to be an honorable man, but that is not enough. When he says &quot;This is John McCain and I approve this ad,&quot; don't believe it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He seems incapable of controlling his campaign. By contrast, Barack Obama's ads are relatively accurate, and Obama is quick to take responsibility for - and fix - mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How a candidate runs a national political campaign is an indicator of how he/she would run the office of the president, if elected. We all must understand that when we vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd like to remind the letter writer that John McCain was one of the co-sponsors of a recent bill that among other things would have granted amnesty and given 12-million illegal immigrants a way to become U.S. citizens. How far left of Hillary Clinton is John McCain?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All about gender - Sept. 14, letter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrong comparison</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's face it, if Barack Obama weren't an articulate, young, good-looking black male he wouldn't be running as the Democratic candidate for president. Comparing him to Sarah Palin for their potential leadership roles is like night and day. The presidency is not a training job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has been an Illinois state senator for eight years and a U.S. senator for less than three years. In Washington he has basically done nothing and voted in absentia more than not. He's run not one form of government large or small for any length of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, I'll admit, he's a great, charismatic, ambassador of peace and good will, a &quot;chicken in every pot&quot; kind of guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we need to stop comparing Obama to Palin and compare him to John McCain, someone who has put it all on the line. The Obama folks aren't willing to do that because they know they'd lose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The son of U.S. Rep. Allen Boyd, a Panhandle Democrat, is facing federal charges of smuggling illegal immigrants after being stopped by Border Patrol agents in Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John F. Boyd, 30, admitted picking up the passengers in the desert, authorities said. He was stopped Sunday at a border checkpoint near Willcox and a search dog indicated people might be hiding in the bed of the white Ford pickup he was driving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agents found two people under a piece of plywood, according to a federal complaint (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/complaint_boyd.pdf) obtained by the Buzz, and two more adults lying on the floorboard behind the front seat. A 6-year-old girl was in the passenger seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Methamphetamine and a loaded Beretta pistol were found, according to the complaint. It did not indicate who the items belonged to and no drug or weapons charges have been filed against Boyd. He has a preliminary hearing this morning in Tucson.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Web site takes aim at Sen. Jeff Atwater, R-North Palm Beach, accusing him of being in the pocket of insurance companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a pretty negative punch. Buzz notes there's also no mention on the Web site, which links back to the Florida Democratic Party, of Atwater challenger Linda Bird.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The finalists are for Justice Kenneth Bell's seat, and they must reside within the 1st District Court of Appeal area. They are: 1st DCA Judge Ricky L.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As state officials try to find out whether gas wholesalers and/or retailers jacked up their prices and gouged consumers, a second question persists: What triggered the public panic at the pump late last week in Gainesville and Tallahassee that forced dozens of stations to run dry?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture Commissioner Charlie Bronson offered one theory Tuesday: &quot;The blogs on the Internet,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm getting concerned that people are believing what they're seeing on the blogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't specify which ones, but the Tallahassee Democrat covered the gas panic in detail, and posted the news at 2:45 p.m. last Friday that a McKenzie Oil convenience store was charging $5.49 a gallon. The post quoted a McKenzie official as saying his wholesaler had increased his price by $1.85 a gallon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the tightest budget year in decades, the Florida Department of Children and Families just got some welcome news: a $5.5-million check from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The money is Florida's reward for the state's improved accuracy rate in processing applications for food stamps and other financial assistance to needy families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The award-winning ACCESS Florida program has provided food stamp assistance to 2.3-million people since last September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An accurate system of distributing food stamps is more vital than ever, considering the state's ravaged economy that has resulted in a sharp spike upward in demand for help. Interim DCF Secretary George Sheldon noted that over the past year, requests for food stamps have increased by 62 percent in Lee County, 59 percent in Hernando, 54 percent in Gadsden and 52 percent in Charlotte.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI (AP) - Move over, Al Gore. You may lay claim to the Internet, but John McCain helped create the BlackBerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least that's the contention of a top McCain policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin. Waving his BlackBerry personal digital assistant and citing McCain's work as a senator, he told reporters Tuesday, &quot;You're looking at the miracle that John McCain helped create.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said McCain's service on and leadership of the Senate Commerce Committee put him at the intersection of a number of economic interests, including the telecommunications industry.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not about race,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain-Palin ticket is having remarkable success with its revolutionary campaign tactic that I call: &quot;Lying Eyes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've named it after that classic joke about a man caught by his wife in flagrante delicto with another woman. He denies the affair saying, &quot;Who are you gonna believe, me or your lying eyes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't seem to matter what the facts are or how directly they contradict the candidates' claims, the McCain-Palin campaign is sticking with its fantasy version. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story line in a presidential campaign has always been important. It is the incisive narrative of who the candidates are and what they represent. But the McCain-Palin campaign has put way too much &quot;story&quot; in story line, making things up and selling pablum to an apparently credulous electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, the most obvious example is the leviathan pork-barrel $223-million bridge to nowhere that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin claims to have opposed. She has put this at the top of her resume for the job of Vice Maverick-in-Chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't seem to matter, as has now been reported endlessly, that when Palin ran for governor she endorsed the bridge project that would have connected a tiny island with few residents to the mainland city of Ketchikan. She only abandoned it when the project became politically radioactive. Then, as governor, Palin kept the hundreds of millions in taxpayer money, redirecting the cash for other transportation projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is as if these facts are not in evidence. McCain-Palin campaign ads are still touting how &quot;She stopped the Bridge to Nowhere.&quot; And on the stump she continues to say &quot;I told Congress thanks but no thanks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also know that Palin is queen of winning federal earmarks. As mayor of Wasilla, she hired a private lobbyist to help bring in $27-million in earmarks to her town of 7,000. As governor, she has made the largest per-capita federal earmark request in the nation, totalling nearly $750-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when the McCain-Palin campaign runs on an end-to-earmarks message and seeks to tar Barack Obama with his earmark requests that are modest by comparison, it is once again resorting to those Lying Eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now let's talk about taxes. The campaign of John McCain has put out a series of scary campaign ads about Obama's tax plan. Newsweek has dubbed them a &quot;pattern of deceit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's new ad says that Obama plans to impose &quot;painful tax increases on working American families&quot; and past ads have said Obama wanted to raise taxes on &quot;families&quot; making just $42,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the truth: Obama's plan would substantially cut taxes to all but the wealthiest families - far more than McCain's tax plan would. But if you're yearning for some more hefty tax cuts for the nation's rich, then McCain's your man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has analyzed both campaigns' tax plans and found that Obama's would cut taxes for 81.3 percent of all households and for 95.5 percent of households with children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going with Obama's plan, according to the center, would reward middle-income taxpayers to the tune of $2,200 in tax cuts annually by 2012. While taxpayers in the top 1 percent of income would face an average tax increase of $19,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under McCain's tax plan, middle-income taxpayers would see a rise of $1,400 in after-tax income by 2012. But for those in the top 1 percent, McCain would cut their taxes by more than $125,000 annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's plan would increase the national debt by $5-trillion by 2018, while Obama's plan would increase it by $3.5-trillion, according to the center. Yet McCain's ads warn that Obama's plan would bring about &quot;years of deficits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only thing &quot;maverick&quot; about McCain's use of lies to smear his opponent is how breathtakingly blatant they are.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This nation is facing real challenges on the economy, health care, jobs and the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are significant differences between how Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain would address them. But McCain's recent campaign ads suggest the most vital issues are whether Obama wanted to teach sex education to kindergarten children and whether he derided the Republican's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, by talking about lipstick on a pig. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's straight talk has become a toxic mix of lies and double-speak. It is leaving a permanent stain on his reputation for integrity, and it is a short-term strategy that eventually will backfire with the very types of independent-thinking voters that were so attracted to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sex education ad says that Obama supported &quot;comprehensive sex education&quot; for kindergarten children. Graphics then appear with a voice-over saying: &quot;Learning about sex before learning to read?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts: Obama, while a state lawmaker in Illinois, supported a measure to provide older students with age and developmentally appropriate sex education. Younger children, such as those kindergarten-age, would be taught &quot;age-appropriate&quot; things such as how to protect themselves from sexual predators. The legislation was widely backed by the state PTA and the Illinois Public Health Association. Parents could choose to opt out of any instruction for their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in McCain's campaign playbook, this responsible legislation becomes fodder for a grotesque distortion as a way to instill fear in voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the lipstick-on-a-pig controversy, McCain's campaign has purposely twisted the way Obama used that expression in a recent speech in Virginia. A McCain campaign ad claims that Obama was directing an insult to Palin who, during the Republican National Convention, characterized hockey moms like herself as pit bulls with lipstick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth: Obama used the phrase, which he had used before, to attack McCain's claim that he'll reform Washington while retaining the policies of President Bush. After using the lipstick-on-a-pig phrase, Obama said, &quot;You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change. It's still going to stink after eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's faux chivalrous outrage over Obama's purported insult is beneath him. He has been a serious public servant willing to say unpopular truths when he thought it best for the country, but he's more than willing in this election to put his name on campaign lies. The leader who says he would rather lose an election than lose a war now risks losing his reputation in an attempt to win the White House.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can handle the truth! The push for the November election brings commercial after commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it became clear that it was going to be senators Obama and McCain, I had high hopes that we would have a positive, issue-oriented run-up to the election. That they would be gentlemen and instruct their staffs to act accordingly in their commercials and their appearances, trusting the American people to be able to judge them according to their merits, abilities, how they presented themselves and if we believed they could lead this country out of the current financial and military crisis. Instead, both camps quickly went to the same tired formula of negative attack ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a thought: If you want to be president, maybe you need to act presidential first. Don't tell us why he shouldn't be president; explain why you should.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Call to 'Drill, Baby, Drill' Misleads Nation, Threatens Florida&quot; (Our Opinion, Sept. 7):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rushed decisions&quot; is not actually accurate - this is something that has been debated for many years. The majority of Americans are tired of being put off; they have spoken, but our leaders are not listening. The frustration causes them to chant &quot;drill, baby drill&quot; and hoping they will be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You say it won't work, but there are other experts that say it will. And if we do not try, we will not know. I like Florida beaches, too - most Floridians do. But if we wait too long, the Cubans will hire the Chinese to drill for them - and the Chinese do not have the know-how that we do, nor will they be concerned about our beaches. It is not just the Florida economy that is at stake in this matter - the nation's economy is hurting. And it is going to be a long time before we learn to fly those big planes without oil. If the economy gets worse, we will not have to be concerned about tourists coming to Florida.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Case Of 'Scareism'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think this is one of the poorest editorials I have read in your paper. It is based on &quot;scareism&quot; rather than facts. A few of the facts that you need to address are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Oil drilling is safe and has been so for many years. Oil spillage, per U.S. Minerals Management Services, in barrels per year is, U.S. offshore 6,555; natural ooze from ocean floors surrounding the U.S. is 620,500. Oil company leaks are a tad compared to nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* U.S. oil production has decreased since 1980 to 2006 from 300,000 million (300 billion) from 190,000 million (190 billion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oil we import costs about $25 billion per year. Most comes from the Persian Gulf countries, Venezuela, Iran and Russia. They are not necessarily our friends. This $25 billion can be reduced if we drill in the Gulf, ANWR and in the continental United States. Let's get all the domestic oil we can and save billions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research And Conserve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drilling our way out of high oil prices is unsupported by fact. The additional volume available is not large enough to make a significant difference in our supply, and the time it would take to reach market is many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worse yet, chanting the &quot;drill now&quot; mantra only distracts from the real avenue to energy independence - reduced consumption and the search for alternatives to oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our addiction to oil for generations now has caused our foreign policy to protect our sources of oil with little regard for the methods or consequences. We have supported or created regimes solely on their ability to keep the oil flowing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount of money leaving this country to buy oil is a significant factor in our trade imbalance, weakening the dollar on the world market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research now! Conserve now! Stop the lies and face reality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;McCain Is Green No More&quot; (Other Views, Sept. 5):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">N.Y. Times columnist Thomas Friedman's criticism of John McCain on environmental/energy issues is flawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friedman claims drilling for oil in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge would damage the environment. Apparently he would prefer to leave oil drilling and oil production to Russia, Nigeria and other countries which are notorious for polluting our earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Friedman truly cared about the environment, he would leave oil drilling to U.S. companies, which are sensitive to the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Friedman had watched the Republican Convention, he would know drilling for oil is only one part of the Republican energy plan. Wind, solar, natural gas, development of alternative fuels and drilling oil are all part of the Republican plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since oil is readily available, it makes sense to use it now while the other sources are being developed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bev Griffiths has her head in the sand regarding offshore drilling along the Florida coast. Current technology for offshore drilling is safe and effective. Case in point, we just had a major hurricane - Gustav - roar through the Gulf of Mexico without a single oil spill resulting. Her mentioning of so-called &quot;experts&quot; who merely parrot Democrat talking points about only saving a few cents a gallon 10 years from now misses the boat entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes our beaches are beautiful and worthy of protection; they're also virtually useless to our economy if people can't afford to get to them.</SPAN></P>

It's polluting land and sea, destroying wildlife and natural habitat and depleting energy and natural resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This above paragraph in the article by Elizabeth Becker from the Washington Post and printed on the front page of the Sept. 7 Commentary section is a perfect description for the experiences of a native Floridian over 65 years of age. It also precisely describes the condition of the Tampa Bay area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did anyone read the article before printing it and juxtaposing the editorial on page 2, &quot;Call to 'Drill, Baby, Drill' Misleads Nation, Threatens Florida&quot;? Your editorial supports a threat to our demise. You want to grow our tourism, so detrimental to our planet, by saving our coast at the expense of good-paying jobs and the citizens of Florida while ensuring our reliance on foreign oil.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alaska lawmakers voted Friday to subpoena Todd Palin, the husband of Republican vice presidential candidate Gov. Sarah Palin. The Legislature hired an investigator to examine whether Sarah Palin ousted Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan in July because he refused to fire state Trooper Mike Wooten, who went through a messy divorce from Palin's sister. The investigation is looking at whether Palin used her power to try to settle a personal score. The investigation - known as &quot;Troopergate&quot; - began before Palin was chosen as Sen. John McCain's running mate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Palin, no crowd for McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there were any doubts that the sidekick was stealing the show, they were put to rest when Sarah Palin took off for Alaska with a wave from the tarmac by John McCain. His crowds suddenly dwindled. The exuberant cheering heard day after day during two weeks of joint appearances went away. And the Republican presidential candidate's schedule began to resemble the lightness of May instead of the full throttle of September. Meantime, Palin's campaign plane taking her home to Alaska was so crowded it had to let off some cargo to get the weight down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain mocked as computer illiterate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is mocked as an out-of-touch, out-of-date computer illiterate in a television commercial out Friday as Democrat Barack Obama begins his sharpest barrage yet on McCain's long Washington career. The ad includes footage of McCain from the early '80s, wearing giant glasses and an out-of-style suit, interspersed with shots of a disco ball, a clunky phone, an outdated computer and a Rubik's Cube. &quot;1982, John McCain goes to Washington,&quot; an announcer says over chirpy elevator music. &quot;Things have changed in the last 26 years, but McCain hasn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, Tuesday in a television ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This claim goes back to Obama's days as a state senator in the Illinois General Assembly. In 2003, the Assembly considered a bill to expand sex education directives from grades 6-12 to grades K-12. The legislation required the curriculum to be medically accurate and include information on the prevention of HIV and contraceptives. It also said abstinence must be taught. Most pertinent to the kindergarten allegation, the legislation states that &quot;course material and instruction shall be age and developmentally appropriate.&quot; Carol Ronen, the now-retired state senator who sponsored the bill, said its main intent was to make sure teenagers got information that was &quot;medically accurate.&quot; A secondary effect was to expand age-appropriate sex education to allow things like teaching schoolchildren to avoid sex predators, Ronen said. &quot;Barack never had anything to do with it,&quot; she said. Obama voted for the legislation in committee on a party-line vote. He was not a sponsor nor a co-sponsor, and the legislation never made it to a full Senate vote. So calling it one of his accomplishments is absurd, since it never became law and it wasn't his bill anyway. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously unseen footage emerged Thursday showing Republican presidential candidate John McCain as a proud, stoic prisoner of war in Hanoi on the day his Vietnamese captors released him to the U.S. military. A former reporter from Swedish broadcaster SVT, Erik Eriksson, 71, said he found the video in the network's archives while researching a book he was writing about his experiences as a Vietnam War correspondent. The footage was filmed by a North Vietnamese photographer with whom Eriksson had contracted to film the release of U.S. prisoners of war. The footage begins with prisoners being led out of a Hanoi compound one by one. McCain grimaces as he steps off a bus with other prisoners. He has a pronounced limp and needs to put both feet on the same step before continuing but is not using crutches. McCain, like other prisoners, briskly walks up to salute and shake hands with U.S. military officers. Although only 37, he has prematurely white hair. Then the prisoners are seen walking to a U.S. plane. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cindy McCain's pill woes revisited</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain said his wife assumed a major role in raising their four children in Arizona while he has spent almost three decades in Washington. &quot;Cindy has carried a significant part of that burden,&quot; he said in an interview with People. &quot;I hope I've been a loving father,&quot; said McCain, 72. Cindy McCain also discussed her addiction to painkillers. In the late 1980s, she underwent back surgeries and became addicted to painkillers that she was stealing from a medical charity she had founded. The Washington Post reported that the personal crisis is a more complicated story than she has described, resulting in more consequences for her and those around her than she has acknowledged. Her misuse of painkillers prompted an investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration and local prosecutors that put her in legal jeopardy. &quot;So many lives were damaged by this,&quot; said Jeanette Johnson, whose husband surrendered his medical license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama gets toughon the trail, in ads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama plans to intensify his assault against McCain with new TV ads and more forceful attacks by the candidate and surrogates beginning this morning, as he confronts an invigorated Republican ticket and nervousness in the Democratic ranks. After back-to-back attack ads by McCain, the Obama campaign is planning to sharpen attacks in an effort to counter McCain's attempt to present himself as the candidate of change with his choice of Palin. The new tone is to be presented in a speech by Obama in New Hampshire and backed up by supporters' appearances across the country. Ad themes will include pay equity for women, an issue that has particular resonance as the campaigns battle for female voters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously unseen footage emerged Thursday showing Republican presidential candidate John McCain as a proud, stoic prisoner of war in Hanoi on the day his Vietnamese captors released him to the U.S. military. A former reporter from Swedish broadcaster SVT, Erik Eriksson, 71, said he found the video in the network's archives while researching a book he was writing about his experiences as a Vietnam War correspondent. The footage was filmed by a North Vietnamese photographer with whom Eriksson had contracted to film the release of U.S. prisoners of war. The footage begins with prisoners being led out of a Hanoi compound one by one. McCain grimaces as he steps off a bus with other prisoners. He has a pronounced limp and needs to put both feet on the same step before continuing but is not using crutches. McCain, like other prisoners, briskly walks up to salute and shake hands with U.S. military officers. Although only 37, he has prematurely white hair. Then the prisoners are seen walking to a U.S. plane. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cindy McCain's pill woes revisited</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain said his wife assumed a major role in raising their four children in Arizona while he has spent almost three decades in Washington. &quot;Cindy has carried a significant part of that burden,&quot; he said in an interview with People. &quot;I hope I've been a loving father,&quot; said McCain, 72. Cindy McCain also discussed her addiction to painkillers. In the late 1980s, she underwent back surgeries and became addicted to painkillers that she was stealing from a medical charity she had founded. The Washington Post reported that the personal crisis is a more complicated story than she has described, resulting in more consequences for her and those around her than she has acknowledged. Her misuse of painkillers prompted an investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration and local prosecutors that put her in legal jeopardy. &quot;So many lives were damaged by this,&quot; said Jeanette Johnson, whose husband surrendered his medical license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama gets tough on the trail, in ads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama plans to intensify his assault against McCain with new TV ads and more forceful attacks beginning this morning, as he confronts an invigorated Republican ticket and nervousness in the Democratic ranks. After back-to-back attack ads by McCain, the new tone is to be presented in a speech by Obama in New Hampshire. Ad themes will include pay equity for women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, McCain join on service goals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and McCain pledged to inspire a new commitment to public service Thursday as they set aside the rancor of the campaign in a two-hour forum in New York. They each urged Americans to honor the victims of the country's worst terrorist attack by dedicating their time to service through teaching, the military, the Peace Corps and faith-based volunteering. McCain acknowledged the &quot;rough&quot; nature of the campaign and praised Obama's service as a community organizer - something Sarah Palin mocked in her GOP convention speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;It's not pretty when politicians and pig metaphors mix it up as John McCain did in a new ad.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story begins, like so many these days, with Gov. Sarah Palin's speech at the Republican National Convention last week. Having stirred the crowd to its feet more than once, Palin delivered a knockout line when she deadpanned:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love those hockey moms. You know the difference between a hockey mom and a pitbull? Lipstick.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The line drew cheerful applause and has echoed ever since, which seems to explain how Sen. Barack Obama found himself in the middle of an uproar when he uttered a time-worn phrase to denigrate Sen. John McCain's proclaimed agenda for &quot;change&quot; in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After declaring that McCain will follow the policies of President Bush on economics, health care, taxes, education and foreign affairs Obama said, &quot;That's not change. That's just calling the same thing something different. But you know, you can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gasp! He just said lipstick! Did he just call Sarah Palin a pig??!!!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that day, the McCain campaign arranged a conference call for reporters with Jane Swift, the former governor of Massachusetts. She said that when you add up Obama's comments and Palin's comments, you get Obama calling Palin a pig. Swift said Obama should apologize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Calling a very prominent female governor of one of our states a 'pig' is not exactly what we want to see,&quot; Swift said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue has dominated the presidential campaign for two days, with the McCain campaign stirring a controversy by having local lawmakers demand that Obama apologize, and the Obama campaign responding with examples of how often he and others have used the phrase. Obama called the McCain's campaign tactics &quot;lies and phony outrage and Swift-boat politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, the McCain campaign released a Web ad called &quot;Lipstick.&quot; It begins with a clip of Palin delivering her lipstick line, then text flashes on the screen saying &quot;Barack Obama on: Sarah Palin.&quot; A moment later, the ad plays a small portion of Obama's &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; remark, but not enough of his quotation to make clear what he was talking about. The ad concludes with a clip of CBS anchor Katie Couric soberly remarking on sexism on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad has two big problems, as does the complaint of former Gov. Swift. First, in the full text of the remarks it's clear that Obama isn't talking about Sarah Palin. He's talking about McCain's argument that he represents change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, &quot;putting lipstick on a pig&quot; is a popular put-down, especially among politicians. It generally means taking a bad or unattractive idea and trying to dress it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We weren't able to pin down the origins of this folksy expression, but we found tons of instances of people using it. It's so common, the political newspaper The Hill labeled the phrase &quot;Congress Speak&quot; back in June, and gave it an official definition: &quot;an expression used to illustrate that something unattractive cannot be beautified or otherwise positively changed by any amount of makeup or other exterior alterations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and McCain both have used the expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 2007, Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson quoted Obama using the phrase to discuss Iraq policy:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that both General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are capable people who have been given an impossible assignment,&quot; Obama said. &quot;George Bush has given a mission to General Petraeus, and he has done his best to try to figure out how to put lipstick on a pig.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Iowa on Oct. 11, 2007, McCain panned Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care plan, calling it &quot;eerily reminiscent&quot; of the plan that failed during Bill Clinton's administration, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think they put some lipstick on a pig,&quot; McCain said, &quot;but it's still a pig.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 1, 2007, McCain blasted a Senate resolution that would have criticized President Bush's strategy in Iraq. Some had praised the resolution as a compromise measure, but McCain disagreed. &quot;It gets down to whether you support what is being done in this new strategy or you don't,&quot; McCain said. &quot;You can put lipstick on a pig, (but) it's still a pig, in my view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is simply impossible to view the complete remarks by Obama and conclude that he's making a veiled and unsavory reference to Palin. Her name never is used in the preceding sentence. In fact, it's hard to see how one could interpret Obama's lipstick-on-a-pig remark as referring directly to McCain, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We think it's very clear that Obama was saying McCain's effort to call himself the &quot;candidate of change&quot; is like putting lipstick on a pig, trying to dress up a bad idea to look better. Agree or disagree with Obama's point, but his remark wasn't the smear that McCain's people have tried to make it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anyone's doing any smearing, it's the McCain campaign and its outrageous attempt to distort the facts. Did Obama call Palin a pig? No, and saying so is Pants on Fire wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama on Sarah Palin: &quot;You can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Web ad by the campaign of Sen. John McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama so clearly wasn't talking about Palin it's a wonder anybody has the nerve to suggest he was.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tampa Tribune</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox's new big-ticket item, &quot;Fringe,&quot; opens tonight with a creepy adrenaline rush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Boston-bound jetliner experiences mysterious turbulence, passengers panic, but the plane lands safely. And then (horrors!) we learn that all the passengers are dead; their flesh has dissolved into goop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then (more horrors!) &quot;Fringe&quot; slows down and slogs along for the rest of the $10 million, 90-minute pilot that sets up what seems another &quot;X-Files.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a lot of weirdness, some car chases, a few explosions, a strange deadly virus, the usual government conspiracy and a cow almost as endearing as those heifers in the Chick-fil-A commercials. It's entertaining stuff if you don't ask too many questions about the logic involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But because this is from J.J. Abrams (&quot;Felicity,&quot; &quot;Alias,&quot; &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;), more is expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missing is the &quot;Wow!&quot; factor, so sci-fi fans will have to wait and see how it shakes out after it settles down into hourlong weekly episodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the plus side are the two leads: Australian actress Anna Torv as FBI Special Agent Olivia Dunham and likable Joshua Jackson (&quot;Dawson's Creek&quot;) as Peter Bishop, a scruffy reluctant genius drafted into helping her investigate things that are on the &quot;fringe&quot; of science. Will they be the next Scully and Mulder?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agent Dunham reunites drifter Peter with his father, Walter Bishop (John Noble), a crusty old mad scientist who has been locked away in an insane asylum for 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the old boy is sprung, he's ready to go back to the basement of a university science lab for experiments on mind-melting, altered consciousness, time travel, astral projection, telepathy, mind control, teleportation, re-animation and the like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a few humorous touches, some inspired dialogue and a hint of romance, so it's not as dark or as desperate as &quot;Lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abrams has promised that the show will have weird cases to resolve each week as well as an ongoing mystery involving the control of &quot;fringe&quot; discoveries. The incident on the plane, for example, is one of several mysterious occurrences linked to Massive Dynamic, the fictional, possibly evil conglomerate on &quot;Fringe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in a possible tip of the hat to Dr. Strangelove, Massive Dynamic's weirdo director, Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), has a strange robotic arm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some things borrowed from &quot;Lost.&quot; Before each commercial break, for example, green glowing images are displayed briefly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the kind of geeky clue stuff that sends fans to the Internet where they can find information about Massive Dynamic, which recalls &quot;Lost's&quot; DHARMA Project (Department of Heuristics And Research on Material Applications). Ouch, I'm getting a headache.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REAL FRINGE: Speaking of fringe science, &quot;How to Build a Better Being,&quot; at 10 tonight on the National Geographic Channel, is a fascinating look at the possibility of gene engineering, which could speed up evolution. It could be the answer to ending disease, or it could give us some really freaky things. Included is a segment where evolutionary scientists play the video game Spore, which allows players to invent their own creatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TODAY COMING: The NBC &quot;Today&quot; show plans a Tampa stop on Sept. 23 as part of a four-day tour of &quot;battlegrounds&quot; for presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC says that &quot;Today&quot; will &quot;zero in on the deep divisions and cultural chasms that have turned these states into hotbeds of political combat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tour begins in Philadelphia on Sept. 22; Tampa is next; Norfolk, Va., is on the 24th; and Detroit on Sept. 25.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A born-and-raised conservative New Englander with a buzz haircut, a white linen suit and Lacoste swimming trunks, Steve Duprey was far from his element when he arrived on the campus of a Southwest Florida liberal arts college as a freshman in 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The swimming pool was bathing suit optional. Students wore flip-flops to class. And kicking back with your professor over a cigar and a couple of beers was practically a prerequisite for the sculpture course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly four decades later, Duprey credits his years as a student at New College in Sarasota with helping him loosen the knot in his tie and priming him for his current role as Sen. John McCain's &quot;chief morale officer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duprey, 55, has spent almost every day for the past nine months by the Republican presidential candidate's side. He is part close friend, part adviser and part comic relief. He has done everything from carry McCain's tote bag at campaign events to advise him on issues to don a T-shirt painted to look like a rainbow bikini in order to make the candidate laugh during a dark day on the campaign trail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a very serious election,&quot; Duprey said in a telephone interview during a recent campaign reprieve at McCain's Arizona ranch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got to have a little fun now and then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duprey is one of four people who travel with McCain full-time. McCain's campaign calls him an adviser, and he was a deputy chairman of the Republican National Convention, which was held in Minnesota last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Duprey is much more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, he is always prepared for some humor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His travel bags are chock-full of what he calls &quot;swag&quot; -- beach balls, chocolates, Partida tequila, &quot;A straight shot on a Straight Talk Express&quot; shot glasses, McCain Team Kaleefornia hats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He never knows when a gag might come in handy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of the time he's quite amused,&quot; Duprey said of McCain. &quot;I've gotten very good at figuring out when the wrong time would be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duprey creates his own McCain garb, too. He has devised an array of quirky slogans and paid out of his own pocket to have them printed on jackets, T-shirts, bumper stickers, buttons and hats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris Hilton's energy-focused response ad to the McCain campaign spot calling Barack Obama a celebrity just like her? Duprey minted some T-shirts with the words &quot;Senator Obama; Paris Hilton; At least one of them has a good energy plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Products of an &quot;underutilized mind,&quot; Duprey said. &quot;We spend a lot of time in planes and motorcades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duprey got this gig through dedication: a lifetime of it to the GOP, and over a year of it to a foundering presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He unofficially retired from politics in 2001 after serving nine years as state party chairman in New Hampshire. But in 2005 some McCain supporters asked if he would help the Arizona senator should he run for president in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Duprey had hit it off after meeting in the early 1980s through former Texas Sen. Phil Gramm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the decision was easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I immediately liked him because he had a healthy irreverence,&quot; Duprey recalled. &quot;The pomposity that you see around Washington is something he likes to poke fun at, and so do I.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duprey, whose 86-year-old mother lives on Longboat Key, stuck with McCain's campaign even when it appeared to be over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last summer was a bad time,&quot; he said. &quot;The campaign imploded. It had no money. The political writers were saying, 'John McCain is dead, it's just a question of when we bury the body.' I was one of those who said, 'I'm not quitting unless you quit.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When McCain's presence commanded too few reporters to fill the 15-passenger van that Duprey rented for his New Hampshire campaign jaunts, Duprey picked up the candidate from the airport in his red Chevy Suburban and drove him to town hall meetings himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was counting on New Hampshire, the second contest in the nine-way Republican primary race, to revive his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Jan. 8, 2008, McCain gave a victory speech in New Hampshire. He was back in the running, and Duprey was invited to travel with McCain for a couple of weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after, the campaign asked him to join full time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mostly I'm just there to support John,&quot; Duprey said, &quot;doing anything he needs, helping keep his spirits high.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duprey had his own brush with elected office in the early 1970s. He had been at New College for less than a year when he decided to run for the New Hampshire state House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That summer he recruited New College students to help knock on doors. Don Davidson was one of them. Davidson hitchhiked from his home in Des Moines, Iowa, to Duprey's parents' house in the Mount Washington Valley area of New Hampshire to manage the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duprey spent $1,000 that he had saved up from summer jobs, including one as a cook at an all-girls summer camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His House campaign slogans lacked the punch of his McCain lines: &quot;Time for some new blood in the legislature&quot; and &quot;A balanced team can do a better job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he easily won the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was 19 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New College gave Duprey the freedom of off-campus study, and his professors were lenient when he had to be in New Hampshire on government business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was deep into his thesis in the fall of 1973 when the New Hampshire legislature went into a special session to cut the budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From his seat on the House floor, he completed his 60-page paper on whether elected officials felt they had to vote how their constituents wanted them to or how they wanted to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duprey served two terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that, his career seemed to veer away from the c'est la vie attitude he honed at New College in piano class and during lunchtime tutorials from professors along the Bayfront. He graduated from Cornell Law School. He worked at a law firm. He started a real-estate development company, which was fined for mortgage fraud although Duprey denied any wrongdoing and was never charged with a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duprey also got married and raised three children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His role as a roadie with John McCain at this point in his life seems fitting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rare day passes by without him cracking a joke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A selection of his McCain creations is now for sale at dupreymccaingear.com -- although he makes no money off the sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking back, he marvels at how those three years at New College changed his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was probably the height of liberalism and the liberal college experience,&quot; he said. &quot;I became a much broader-minded person, a much more tolerant person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, did he eventually, uh, shed that Lacoste bathing suit?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A political pro, Duprey answered without answering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I enjoyed New College fully as I adapted to it,&quot; he said with a laugh.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The petroleum industry is spending millions on ads to lift the offshore moratorium.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertisements began popping up on television screens across the country this summer. A blond-haired woman in a dark pantsuit walks across a map of America and talks about how the country needs more energy - and there's plenty of it just offshore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But unlike many countries, our Congress puts much of it off limits,&quot; the woman tells viewers. &quot;A majority of Americans say that should change. Today's technology allows us to tap these resources and protect the environment. So let's put America's oil and natural gas to work ... for Americans.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads are part of a multimillion-dollar campaign by the American Petroleum Institute. The institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, wants to push Congress to lift a moratorium on offshore drilling off the Florida coast and other parts of the country, said institute vice president Jim Craig.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign seeks to capitalize on polls showing more public support than ever for offshore drilling, and it has benefited from the failure of traditional drilling opponents to muster much of a counterattack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oil industry's aggressive ad campaign may hit its goal this week as Democrats and Republicans in the Senate hope to push through an energy bill that would allow drilling as close as 50 miles off Florida's beaches. It would also allow a handful of other coastal states to choose whether to opt in as well. And it calls for investing $20-billion in developing petroleum-free motor vehicles and extending tax credits for solar and wind energy that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House may vote on a similar bipartisan initiative later this month, according to a spokesman for Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rising gas prices have also pushed energy to the forefront of the presidential race, with GOP nominee John McCain going so far as to make a campaign stop last month on a rig in the central Gulf of Mexico co-owned by Chevron and ExxonMobil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will drill new wells offshore, and we'll drill them now,&quot; he told the Republican National Convention on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under fire from McCain, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said he would be willing to support limited additional offshore oil drilling if it was part of a comprehensive energy plan that promoted alternate fuels too - exactly the sort of bill Congress may vote on this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the time is ripe for achieving the petroleum industry's long-sought goal of overturning the moratorium, which dates back to 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Petroleum Institute has been running television ads touting the good side of the oil and gas industry since 2005. But now the organization launched a more intensive campaign, buying slots on both network and cable news channels for its new ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how much the latest TV ad cost to produce, all Craig would say was, &quot;A lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the institute has also been buying full-page ads in the St. Petersburg Times, Orlando Sentinel and other newspapers around Florida, as well as in USA Today and Newsweek magazine, and running radio ads as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole point of this is to help people understand our industry and the value it brings to our American way of life,&quot; Craig said. &quot;More and more people agree that we need access&quot; to the off-limits areas, such as the waters off Florida's beaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drilling opponents, a group that always included both environmental organizations and tourism and beach-related businesses, have not managed to mount a similar advertising blitz. The liberal group Moveon.org and the national Sierra Club both ran limited advertising earlier this summer criticizing McCain for saying that expanded drilling would lower gas prices in the short term, but that's been it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belatedly, a handful of activists have launched a campaign called &quot;Don't Rig Florida's Economy.&quot; On Aug. 30, the fledgling organization sponsored a night at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium. About 190 people showed up to hear a panel discussion and then see a free dolphin show, said Cathy Harrelson of the Sierra Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization - a loose coalition of groups such as the Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife and Surfrider, as well as some businesspeople worried about beach pollution harming the tourist trade - was slow to gear up on the issue, Harrelson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people had some complacency about this because we'd managed to fight it off for all these years,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, in July, the state's newspapers reported that the latest Quinnipiac University poll found that 60 percent of the Floridians who were likely to vote in the presidential race supported drilling for oil and gas in areas offshore that are now protected. That, plus the American Petroleum Institute ads and news about what was happening in Congress, finally galvanized the opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We knew we had to do something,&quot; Harrelson said. One particularly nettlesome point for the opponents was that the bill proposed in the Senate would not give Floridians any say in expanding drilling, unlike other coastal states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formed in July, the coalition set up a Web site - dontrigflorida.com - then started e-mailing news release and staging events designed to stimulate grass roots opposition to offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But don't look for any expensive TV ads like the ones the institute bought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's this coalition,&quot; Harrelson said, &quot;but there's really not much money behind it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By BILLY HOUSE and WILLIAM MARCH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tampa Tribune</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the finish line of the long presidential race in sight, the battle for Florida and other key swing states now becomes a two-month sprint, with voters having a choice now of not only ideology, but also history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After their convention last week in St. Paul, Minn., Republicans garnered a new burst of energy behind their campaign, tied to Sen. John McCain's surprise selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate, the first woman the party has ever nominated for vice president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats, who met the week before in Denver, made Sen. Barack Obama the first black nominated for president by a major American political party. They seemed less unified, however, their wounds still fresh from the tough primary battle between Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only in the past week, in reaction to the GOP convention and McCain's choice of Palin, have some hard-core Clinton supporters, including former Tampa Mayor Sandy Freedman and Clerk of Court Pat Frank, declared their allegiance to Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political experts say Florida clearly will be one of the top battleground states - maybe the top - in this dash to Nov. 4, as it has been in the past two election cycles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Premiere Battleground State'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, as in 2000 and 2004, Florida is the largest state that's considered winnable for either party, and the one swing state that McCain must win to become president. McCain has publicly declared that he can't win without Florida, noted spokesman Mario Diaz; Obama state director Steve Schale calls it &quot;the premiere battleground state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going into the conventions, most pollsters considered the state nearly deadlocked. A Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research poll for The Tampa Tribune showed Obama with a 1-point lead - in effect, a tie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Quinnipiac University Polling Institute survey Aug. 17-24 showed McCain up 47 percent to 43 percent in the state. That poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, making that a virtual deadlock as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, tracking polls show Obama with a narrow lead after the conventions, but to the campaigns, the race is no longer about votes nationwide - it's about winning states in the Electoral College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No published polling has been done in Florida since the conventions, and pollsters can only speculate on how Obama's speech in Denver and McCain's running-mate choice affected public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think the conventions will change a lot in Florida,&quot; said Jim Kitchens, a Democratic-oriented Florida pollster. His poll for the Florida Chamber of Commerce showed McCain about 3 points up - also a statistical tie - before the conventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we'll be in the margin of error through election night,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first post-convention sign of the importance of Florida's 27 electoral votes, Clinton is planning to visit Kissimmee and Tampa on Monday for pro-Obama rallies focusing on the differences between McCain and Obama regarding the economy and health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were tentative plans for Palin to tour Florida, including a Tampa stop the same day. But those plans were canceled, GOP Sen. Mel Martinez and local McCain campaign officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plans for campaigning here by Clinton and Palin likely were aimed at the crucial women's vote, in which Obama apparently is benefiting from a major &quot;gender gap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Mason-Dixon poll conducted before McCain's vice presidential choice was announced, Obama won 51 percent to 39 percent among women, but McCain held the advantage among men, winning 51 percent to 37 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain&nbsp;Ad Targets Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June and July, Obama carpet-bombed Florida with advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the McCain-Palin campaign and the Republican National Committee targeted Florida for a new ad called &quot;Temple,&quot; which continues their portrayal of Obama as a celebrity, charges that he opposes more offshore drilling and claims he really represents old liberal ideas like higher taxes, not change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That ad will also run in Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - a hint of which states the McCain team considers keys to a win in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kitchens said the three keys to Florida for Obama are the large number of new Democratic registrants his candidacy has inspired, and whether they turn out to vote; the youth vote; and the Jewish vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young and black voters are less likely to go to the polls, and Obama has had difficulty establishing trust with Jewish retirees in South Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has to have two of those three to win,&quot; Kitchens said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain also faces uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Bush won in 2000 and 2004, the governor of Florida was his brother, Jeb Bush, who dominated the Republican Party more firmly than Gov. Charlie Crist does now; and 2006, when Democrats gained seats in the state House, the congressional delegation and the state Cabinet, was the best election for Democrats in a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quinnipiac pollster Peter Brown says independent voters, who backed McCain 47 percent to 39 percent in the mid-August poll, likely will decide the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half of the Florida voters in the Quinnipiac poll, 52 percent, said the economy is the most important issue; they trust Obama over McCain, 46 percent to 42 percent, to handle it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also trust Obama, by 48 percent to 44 percent, as better able to handle the energy crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the respondents trust McCain more, 53 percent to 35 percent, to handle relations with Russia; by 45 percent to 42 percent to handle a natural disaster such as a hurricane; and by 56 percent to 33 percent to handle a terrorist incident in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another sign of the race's tightness in Florida, several of these &quot;trust&quot; preferences were close to the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(CHART) WATCHING THEIR WORDS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as there are common themes in the Democratic and Republican presidential platforms, there are common words. Theses two images, called tag clouds, illustrate the key words that came up most often in the convention speeches of Democrats Barack Obama, Joe Belden and Hillary Clinton compared with Republicans John McCain and Sarah Palin and supporter Joseph Liberman. The bigger the type, the more often that word was used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(see microfilm for details)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Note: Common words such as &quot;the&quot; &quot;or&quot; and &quot;I&quot; were excluded, and variations of the same word such as &quot;child&quot; and &quot;children&quot; were counted together. Also, the number of times people's names were mentioned includes both first and last names.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having never heard Gov. Sarah Palin, I sat on the edge of my chair awaiting her speech Wednesday. If there was fear, I never heard it. If there was lack of self-confidence, I did not detect it. If there was lack of compassion and true feeling, I did not sense it. If there was any wavering in her support and respect for Sen. John McCain, I did not hear it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wow, I see why McCain did it now!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a breath of fresh air - the truth, simply said: Fight the establishment and do what is right for a change. The statement that one candidate promotes a career with change, while the other promotes change based on a career, hit the nail on the head. It is about experience and ability to lead on the first day in office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am now excited more than ever for the McCain/Palin ticket and the future of America!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raymond Hetterich, Seminole</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's extreme positions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was appalled by Sarah Palin's snide and distorting speech (written by one of President Bush's speechwriters) Wednesday night which made it clear that she is cut right out of the same cloth as the divisive, cynical Republican politicians who have wreaked so much havoc on us these past eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An antichoice McCain-Palin presidency will set women's rights back half a century as they tilt the Supreme Court with justices who will overturn Roe vs. Wade. Palin is against abortion even in cases of rape and incest. She is for book banning. She believes the Iraq war is &quot;God's task.&quot; She doesn't believe global warming is man-made. She wants creationism taught in schools. She has encouraged the Alaskan Independence Party, whose members want to secede from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is under a bipartisan investigation for abuse of power. She was for the &quot;bridge to nowhere&quot; before it became political poison, and kept the money after she was against it. She lobbied for $27-million in earmarks for her small town while she was mayor only a year and a half ago yet pretends she is against pork now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is for abstinence-only sex education when we can all see how well that philosophy worked for her own daughter. Can you imagine the Republican outcry against liberals and Barack Obama if he had an unwed pregnant daughter right now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list of reasons why this particular woman should not be &quot;one heartbeat&quot; away from the most powerful position in the world goes on and on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shirley Copperman, Tarpon Springs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's the real thing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I watched hours of the Democratic National Convention and some of the Republican National Convention. And after watching Sarah Palin deliver her acceptance speech Wednesday night, I have to say that of all the people who have stood at the microphone at either convention up to then, she came across as the real deal. Those other polished speechmakers looked like wannabes in comparison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the policies, Republican vs. Democrat, I'll take the team that is promising smaller government as opposed to the team that is guaranteeing larger government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John A. Skicewicz, Clearwater</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pit bull and parrot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elephant in the convention hall on Wednesday night was the eight years of Republican rule under the Bush administration, and six years of GOP congressional control which went totally unmentioned. The attacks against Washington power brokers breathed new life into the phrase &quot;We have met the enemy and he is us.&quot; The entire convention acted as if George W. Bush did not exist, banishing the president's presence to a brief five-minute speech by satellite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead Wednesday night at this convention was all about Sarah Palin, who read a speech from the teleprompter but whose words were not her own. In fact, Palin's speech was written by a chief speechwriter for George W. Bush. Palin's only authentic line was her description of herself as &quot;a pit bull with lipstick.&quot; Her speech made this point quite effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is less obvious is that this cutesy attack dog was parroting the same lines written by the same speechwriter of George W. Bush. Remove the lipstick and what do we have? Four more years of more of the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave Goldman, Sarasota</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin has it all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am stunned at the &quot;audacity&quot; of the angry left in their hilarious attempts to discredit Gov. Sarah Palin. How dare they attempt to discredit her personal choices in raising her family! Sexism is alive and well in the far left of this nation. Just ask Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women of this nation should be angry about the smears they have both had to endure. Obama's attack dogs carry out their covert mission while he claims ignorance of the practice and says, &quot;It won't happen in my campaign.&quot; Unbelievable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's historic convention speech left no doubt regarding her ability to lead and communicate. She's a natural. She welcomes this fight not because she seeks it, but because the nation needs her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only difference between Alaska's hockey mom and a pit bull really is lipstick. This lady has it all. Sexism just met its match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly Walton, Pensacola</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using children as props</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin and her supporters say that her children are out of bounds for campaign purposes. But it was she who propped them up on the campaign stage. The message was, &quot;Look at my beautiful children. These are just five of the many reasons you should vote for me.&quot; Sarah Palin used them, and it is too late to take that back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her actions raise questions about her fitness and judgment as a mother, not to mention as a candidate for high public office: She sacrificed her daughter's need for privacy and dignity at this vulnerable and painful time in order to advance her own ambitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregory A. Morgan, Lutz</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hypocritical display</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rarely in my lifetime have I seen such effrontery displayed as when the abstinence-only advocates, Gov. Sarah Palin and the Republican National Committee paraded out the unmarried pregnant 17-year-old daughter and her boyfriend for the glowing approval and applause of the supposedly family values Republican delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What hypocrisy. Someone ought to tell the governor and her supporters that pregnancy is what happens when you rely on abstinence only and eliminate sex education and contraception programs. These people need to get control of their own families before telling others how to live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert M. Spraitz, Clearwater</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A real measure of character</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stop attacking Sarah Palin for the mistakes that her daughter has made. We all make mistakes, and there is no perfect family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I do believe that the absence of core values from our society and institutions are bringing America into the state it is. People try to take the easy way out, teaching in schools that it is all right to have sex as long as they have safe sex. What has happened to teaching abstinence and the rewards that it gives both physically and emotionally?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People do make mistakes, however it is not at the failure we should look, but at how people get back up. Neither Sarah nor Bristol is taking the easy way out, but they are both setting an example about what to do when one does make a mistake. Any kind of life is not a misfortune, it is a miracle and we should protect that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carla Alonso, Tampa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A change in values</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party has touted their values above all others since Dan Quayle took on the &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; issue. So when did they decide that an unwed, pregnant teenager represented our family values? When did premarital sex and teenage marriage become acceptable?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I remember a time, I swear it wasn't that long ago, when the Republicans told us these issues were what was wrong with our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when did it become acceptable for every adult in this child's life to put their interests and ambitions ahead of hers during this, the most difficult time of her young life? When did it become okay to trot her out in front of the entire world and subject her to this kind of intense scrutiny? Did these changes just happen last week? Or have I missed something all these years?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robyn Hitchens, St. Petersburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A chance to educate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pregnancy of Sarah Palin's daughter should not be about politics. It could have happened to Amy or Chelsea and could yet happen in the Obama family. This letter is about the teaching of abstinence and the irony that Bristol Palin is now thrust into the role of poster child for why abstinence does not work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't matter if you are Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, Christian or Muslim, wealthy or poor and most importantly, teenager or adult. The desire to have sex is extraordinarily powerful. It is not just about popular culture, as sexuality has been portrayed as powerful since Adam and Eve. As parents, we must not take this powerful urge for granted. We must talk to our children about it openly and honestly so that our children are not caught unprepared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have the resources to prevent our children from being parents too soon and we must utilize them. Even when they resist, we must talk to our children about sex and responsibility and consequences and, yes, about prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most important, our children must not be afraid to come to us and ask for our help. Thank you, Gov. Palin and Bristol, for giving us a chance to re-examine this issue. We will leave your family alone now, to deal with this as a family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sara Williams, Tampa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giving the GOP a boost</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please, please keep up the radical left drumbeat of panicked ad hominem attacks on Sarah Palin and her family. Each misbegotten &quot;cartoon&quot; and ham-handed reference to out-of-wedlock babies and her Down's syndrome baby - which you all seem to believe is the poster child for the reason to have an abortion - drives hordes of disgusted former middle-of-the-road folks and independents into the Republican camp. Bravo!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregory Palmer, Lutz</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inserting God into politics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech she made in June, Sarah Palin said, regarding the United States sending troops to Iraq, &quot;there is a plan and that plan is God's plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerning natural gas, she said, &quot;God's will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas line built.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I may be missing any understanding of politics and religion at a very fundamental level, but I fail to understand how the war in Iraq and natural gas pipelines to supply Americans with fuel can be construed as God's will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Mueller, Inverness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">War and deception</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a Republican, I am appalled by the actions of my fellow Republicans. The speakers tell us how bad things are in our country under the leadership of President Bush and his administration and then tell us to put a man in office who has voted 90 percent of the time backing Bush. How is that a change?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans keep harping that Obama was wrong on the &quot;surge.&quot; What is wrong, which they forgot, is that we went into Iraq on lies and false pretenses and lost thousands of our troops, leaving many wounded and maimed for life, and many families with lives disturbed forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was against the war. McCain was for the war. Who was right and who was wrong?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard for me to believe that Americans can forget how we went to war in Iraq and the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm just waiting for the Republicans to start chanting, &quot;Four more years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald F. Kelly, St. Petersburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keep an eye on Congress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish Sarah Palin well. If the Democrats had put Hillary Clinton in as their vice presidential candidate, I think they would have had this election hands down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we place too much emphasis on these two offices. We need to look at Congress. They are the ones we need to evaluate carefully and then clean house. They should only be allowed two terms in office - like the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when you go to the polls, be sure you know your candidates, at all the levels of government. If you are satisfied with how our country is doing, vote them back in. If not, well, out the door!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need business-oriented individuals to be in office, people who understand economics, not the lobbyist agendas and the political agendas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does anyone know who Ricky Trinidad's running mate will be? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best part of campaign season, though, are the sound bites. And since (most of) the Pasco and Hernando County coaches are too darned nice to say anything too controversial (at least on the record), I'm being forced to put words in their mouths to keep with the theme of this special section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are some sound bites I predict for the upcoming season:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sept. 5, 2008</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I actually did vote for the spread offense ...before I voted against it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will say it: Mitchell coach Scott Schmitz is asked before the season opener against Gulf about the loss of quarterback Tate Humphrey. After a few years of opening things up, Schmitz is going back to the Wing-T.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote?: Good move by Schmitz. His best teams at River Ridge ran the Wing-T, he's familiar with it and the personnel mandates the move. Besides, I'm not going to be the one to call Schmitz a flip-flopper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oct. 9 2008</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will say it: The week of their huge district showdown, Tarpon Springs coach George Kotis says it's time for Land O'Lakes coach John Benedetto, left, to retire and for the Spongers to return to glory. While being held back by defensive coordinator Al Claggett, a chafed Benedetto utters his famous quote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote: Benedetto deserves a new four-year term! As for Kotis, he must have forgotten Benedetto helped settle Tarpon Springs in the late 1880s when he was known as John Bendepolopagus. And Claggett was a top sponge diver in his youth, until the Great Depression drove him into the lucrative business of high school coaching. (And that, ladies and gentlemen, concludes my yearly requisite age joke about the long-standing Gators staff.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sept. 19, 2008</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I hear your new ideas, I'm reminded of that ad: 'Where's the beef?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will say it: Tom McHugh gets into the spirit of 9-Mile War Week, addressing Zephyrhills' chances of knocking off his Pirates. Pasco is a beefy bunch this year, and word on the street is that Zephyrhills coach Tom Fisher has 18 kids on his roster, 11 of whom weigh less than 130 pounds. Just saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote: Sure, the Bulldogs will be small in 2008. But unless you want to be drinking sludge from the taps during water breaks instead of some of that sparkling, refreshing Zephyrhills water, watch the beef jokes, okay? That said, the Bulldogs are still a 50-50 bet to make the playoffs because, well, Fisher is coaching them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sept. 5, 2008</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Coach, you're no Dub Palmer.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will say it: Some dude in the stands who played one season of junior varsity ball and has to leave the game at halftime to make it to his shift at the Waffle House, as the Leopards fall behind the Bears 21-0 in new coach John Palmer's first home game since coming back to Brooksville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote: Throw that guy out ...NOW! Sure, John Palmer is going to face high expectations because his dad was kind of a stud in local coaching circles. (If you call 232 wins, five state titles and zero losing seasons studly. ...I do.) But give the guy some time. Read my lips: In the end, he's going to win more than he loses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 13, 2008</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am learning to get online myself, and I will have that down fairly soon, getting on myself. I don't expect to be a great communicator, I don't expect to set up my own blog, but I am becoming computer literate to the point where I can get the information that I need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will say it: At least every coach, at least once, when his football stats don't run for some reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vote: I kid, because I love. Besides, it's an excuse to squeeze an earmark in this column for highschool.tampabay.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oct. 3, 2008</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not surprising, then, they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion ...to explain their frustrations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will say it: Nature Coast Jamie Joyner will be struck by the frustration of Pasco fans when his Sharks come into Dade City and walk out with a victory. Joyner tells reporters he sure hopes the Pirates win a state title soon, because even he is sick of hearing about 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote: Time to face facts: 1992 is over. Pasco will probably never win a state title. Ever again. But the Pirates will always be one of the best things going in the county. And at the end of the season, the fine folks in Dade City will always have 1992 (to steal another campaign quip, there I go again) to keep them warm during the winter months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov. 16, 2008</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who am I? Why am I here?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will say it: After a second straight 0-10 season, Sunlake coach Bill Browning is seen muttering to himself in his office as he starts drawing up plays for next year. Starting a new program is tough business, and skipping the whole junior varsity warmup season usually means 2-3 lean years to start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote: The Seahawks will come close one time to victory. They will be tied with someone after three quarters before suffering another double-digit loss. It will be the kind of moral victory that boosts the spirits and gives Browning answers to his own question.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote: Time to face facts: 1992 is over. Pasco will probably never win a state title. Ever again. But the Pirates will always be one of the best things going in the county. And at the end of the season, the fine folks in Dade City will always have 1992 (to steal another campaign quip, there I go again) to keep them warm during the winter months.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By WILLIAM MARCH and BILLY HOUSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tampa Tribune</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. PAUL, Minn. - Exultant over having their own potentially history-making candidate, Republicans at their national convention have seemed intent on matching vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, rather than John McCain, against their opponent Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arizona Sen. McCain's latest television ad compares Alaska Gov. Palin and Illinois Sen. Obama - not McCain and Obama or Palin and the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Delaware Sen. Joe Biden. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In speech after speech by McCain campaign surrogates and spokesmen to crowds at the convention, comparisons are drawn not between the two presidential nominees, or between Palin and Biden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, they're drawn between the bottom of the GOP ticket and the top of the Democratic ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She has a record of bipartisan reform,&quot; the new McCain&nbsp;ad says. &quot;He's the Senate's most liberal. ? She's earned a reputation as a reformer. His reputation? Empty words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the announcer speaks, photos of Obama and Palin move onto and off the screen. McCain's face appears only at the end when he says, &quot;I approved this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political experts speculated on a couple of possible reasons for the frequency of Obama-Palin comparisons and rhetorical matchups at the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be a way of denigrating Obama by comparing him to the lower half of the GOP ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or it may be a way of countering the historic nature of the candidacy of Obama, the first black, major-party presidential nominee. Palin is the first woman on a GOP ticket and would be the nation's first female vice president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What they are saying is if you want to vote for history, now you have a choice,&quot; said New York-based national political pollster John Zogby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates seem thrilled to have a demographic and historic sizzle on their ticket to match the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Either way, we're going to have history made this year. And the possibility of the Republican Party having the first woman vice president is inspiring,&quot; said Jason Duke, 27, a Republican delegate from Fort Myers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign spokesman Jeff Sadosky, asked about the Palin-Obama comparisons, said, &quot;While this race is about the two candidates at the top of the ticket, we'll welcome a discussion contrasting Sarah Palin's years of executive experience overseeing 24,000 employees and a $10 billion budget and Barack Obama's complete lack of executive experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This convention is so taken with Palin that even McCain occasionally seems cast in the shade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll take Sarah Palin any day and John McCain to lead this nation in these turbulent times,&quot; said former New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, speaking Wednesday to the Florida delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, &quot;She's got more executive experience and experience in government than Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a roundtable with battleground state political reporters Tuesday, Doug Holtz-Eakin, senior policy adviser for the McCain campaign, compared Palin at length with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's remarkable that the discussion is between Barack Obama and Sarah Palin,&quot; Holtz-Eakin said. &quot;Palin brings an authenticity that's powerful. It's not just Republicans, people are excited by her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's an accomplished woman, she's got an extraordinary story. ? She's a real American. And he's, you know, been a lot of things. ? But he's not very authentic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holtz-Eakin denied that he meant to say Obama was not a &quot;real American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Palin-Obama contrasts can help McCain, experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It diminishes Obama,&quot; said University of Texas political scientist Bruce Buchanan, a presidential campaign specialist. &quot;It implies he's not on the level with McCain - that the best he can do is go up against this other rookie who, by the way, has executive experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Sabato, veteran political analyst of the University of Virginia, said it's rare for a presidential campaign to make a comparison between a presidential and vice presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've had constant comparisons among vice presidents,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tampa Tribune</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. PAUL, Minn. - From his first TV ad of the general election, John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign played up the Arizona senator's image as an American hero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American president Americans have been waiting for,&quot; the ad said, flickering images of McCain with others of him as a prisoner of war in Vietnam three decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans continue to press that hero image at their national convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday night at the convention, President Bush, Laura Bush, and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson all described McCain's courage as a POW, with the first lady calling him &quot;a real American hero.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And earlier Tuesday, some of McCain's fellow POWs were dispatched to the hotels of various state delegations to tell their tales of his bravery. One of them was a delegate from Florida who sometimes shared the same Hanoi prison cell as McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That American hero theme will build through McCain's scheduled presidential nomination acceptance speech Thursday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Democrats, it is difficult for Barack Obama and his supporters to touch the idea of McCain as a war hero. Instead, they go only as far as to ask whether that status makes him any more qualified to be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, others question whether it is accurate to envelop McCain in the cloak of a &quot;war hero&quot; or seek to politicize his ordeal as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Among them is Robert McComb, a retired Navy commander and Vietnam veteran who is following the convention from his home in Port Ludlow, Wash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defining The Word 'Hero'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain just does not fit my definition of 'hero',&quot; said McComb, who like McCain is a Naval Academy graduate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We call everyone heroes nowadays - football players, basketball players and people who've been a prisoner of war. The word 'hero' has become sort of like 'gourmet' - we've so ruined it that it's lost its meaning,&quot; said McComb. &quot;This is one example.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McComb acknowledges he is an independent voter who has contributed about $150 to Obama. But he is not affiliated with any organized group of anti-McCain veterans, of which there are a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the 24-year Navy veteran says he personally knew McCain's father. And he was there at Pearl Harbor to see the young aviator step off a plane after five years of Vietnamese captivity. McCain had endured a lot personally, but that does not mean he was a hero, McComb said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five-and-half years earlier, in October 1967, McCain's jet had been shot down during a bombing raid on Hanoi. Realizing his father was an admiral and commander in chief of Pacific forces, the Vietnamese sought to score propaganda points by giving McCain an early offer of release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain, whose severe injuries were evident in TV images sent to the United States, refused to take the release before other Americans at the same Hanoi prison who were captured before him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McComb said he doesn't dispute how broken the young Naval aviator's body had become at the hands of his Vietnamese captors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But did that make him a hero?&quot; McComb asks. &quot;A guy who falls on a grenade who saves his buddies - in my mind, that's a hero.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McComb says he finds it ironic that many of the same people who challenged John Kerry's Vietnam War service when he was the Democratic presidential candidate in 2004 are now extolling McCain as a war hero. As he sees it, Kerry did risk his life as the leader of a Swift Boat during the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a Florida delegate - retired Col. George &quot;Bud&quot; Day of Okaloosa County - said, &quot;John McCain is a hero in every sense of the word.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Day was at the Hanoi Hilton as McCain's commander and sometime cellmate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He showed an incredible amount of courage,&quot; said Day. &quot;The Vietnamese were torturing us and trying to get us to do bad things against our country. They offered him early release, ahead of the other guys, and he said 'I'm not leaving here until the guys shot down before me go home, or the guys sicker than me.' That was really a defining moment for John and he did absolutely the right thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, said the term &quot;war hero&quot; had become less valued after Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in McCain's case, he said, the American public does view what he endured as &quot;pretty remarkable.&quot; The use of the term &quot;hero&quot; to describe McCain has become synonymous with &quot;character&quot; - and someone who will be able to do the right thing as commander in chief, Luntz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Question Relevancy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For their part, Obama, who has no military service, and his supporters have stayed clear of diminishing McCain's military service and years as a prisoner of war. But they haven't stayed silent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, former Army Gen. Wesley Clark, himself a former Vietnam veteran, made waves when he said McCain had been a &quot;hero&quot; to him as a prisoner of war during the war years, but his service is not something that means he should be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that tightrope walk has continued. Last week, Democratic New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson raised McCain's military service in an address to the Democratic National Convention in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain served his county in war. We honor his service, but that doesn't mean we have to make him president at a time when America needs change, not more of the same,&quot; said Richardson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Obama, in his nomination acceptance speech, repeated what has become a common line in his campaign stump speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the record's clear,&quot; Obama went on. &quot;John McCain has voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time. Sen. McCain likes to talk about judgment. But really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, former Rhode Island Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee - an Obama backer - said, &quot;It seems that everybody that serves gets called a war hero.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Chafee, who often was an ally of McCain's on controversial issues before the Senate on which they both bucked the GOP, also said that what's &quot;more important than that [being a war hero] is his [McCain's] approach to the world, in which our adversaries and allies both have nuclear weapons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in that regard, said Chafee, he disagrees with McCain's alignment with the Bush-Cheney foreign policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. PAUL, Minn. - The months of painstaking preparation and millions of dollars spent to put on a successful Republican National Convention may be washed away by Hurricane Gustav.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in the end, it could be good news for John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As odd as it seems with the somber tone and truncated schedule for the convention's opening Monday, the reaction to Gustav by Republicans underscores exactly what McCain wants to convey: He's a leader who puts country above party, and he's nothing like the George W. Bush who was caught so flat-footed after Hurricane Katrina three years ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's working to McCain's advantage because once again he's showing that leadership counts. He's right on top of this and willing to make a personal sacrifice of a party for what's good for the country,&quot; said Tampa developer Al Austin, a top Republican fundraiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than speech after speech from Washington Republicans, America's TV screens have been filled with images of Gulf Coast governors focused on the job at hand. Those governors include rising national GOP stars like Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Charlie Crist of Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I traveled our state in the days following Fay's landfall, I was reminded again of the resilience and strength of our people, the kindness they extended to one another. Neighbor helping neighbor, asking not what party you are but instead how you can help,&quot; Crist said in a videotaped address that aired for delegates Monday, along with clips from the other Gulf Coast governors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even revelations that the 17-year-old daughter of McCain's running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, is pregnant didn't look like a major problem. Republicans naturally looked forward to four days of pumping up McCain and tearing down Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama. But given how badly damaged the Republican brand is these days, McCain may well be better off without a four-day commercial for the GOP. There's a reason why many of the most vulnerable Republican incumbents in Congress, including Tom Feeney of Oviedo, skipped the convention altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama argues that voting for McCain is akin to voting for a third Bush term. So McCain surely can't be too disappointed that President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney scrubbed speeches that had been planned for prime time Monday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Laura Bush and Cindy McCain gave brief speeches urging people to help storm victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're clearly in an anti-incumbent election environment. Congress has a 9 percent approval rating, the American voter is feeling jaded and cynical and pessimistic about their elected officials,&quot; said Rep. Adam Putnam, R-Bartow. &quot;I hope that they will be relieved to see that this convention is appropriately shifting its focus and putting the country first, to borrow a McCain campaign expression, even at the expense at the kind of mo' you'd like to see coming out of a Republican convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain may not get much of a lift from a convention overshadowed by storms, but between Gustav and McCain's surprise pick of Palin, Obama likely had his bounce diminished, too. A new CBS national poll found Obama's lead had grown from three points to eight points after the Democratic National Convention last week, but a CNN poll showed the race was a statistical tie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If McCain hoped to use the convention to fire up party activists and the conservative base, that became unnecessary because the selection of Palin already accomplished that. A staunch social conservative, Palin remains a giant question mark, but most delegates in St. Paul are ecstatic to have her on the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of the doubts about McCain from the hard core conservatives are erased,&quot; said Pasco GOP chairman Bill Bunting, predicting that she could get activists as enthusiastic as they were for Bush-Cheney in 2004. &quot;She'll turn out the conservative base, and they're the ones that work the hardest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican activists are sounding as excited as they've been in months. Republican leaders are showing competence and empathy, and McCain no longer has to fret so much about how his acceptance speech will be compared to Obama's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even without a full-fledged convention, this could still be a good week for McCain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I traveled our state in the days following Fay's landfall, I was reminded again of the resilience and strength of our people, the kindness they extended to one another. Neighbor helping neighbor, asking not what party you are but instead how you can help,&quot; Crist said in a videotaped address that aired for delegates Monday, along with clips from the other Gulf Coast governors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even revelations that the 17-year-old daughter of McCain's running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, is pregnant didn't look like a major problem. Republicans naturally looked forward to four days of pumping up McCain and tearing down Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama. But given how badly damaged the Republican brand is these days, McCain may well be better off without a four-day commercial for the GOP. There's a reason why many of the most vulnerable Republican incumbents in Congress, including Tom Feeney of Oviedo, skipped the convention altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama argues that voting for McCain is akin to voting for a third Bush term. So McCain surely can't be too disappointed that President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney scrubbed speeches that had been planned for prime time Monday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Laura Bush and Cindy McCain gave brief speeches urging people to help storm victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're clearly in an anti-incumbent election environment. Congress has a 9 percent approval rating, the American voter is feeling jaded and cynical and pessimistic about their elected officials,'' saidRep. Adam Putnam, R-Bartow. &quot;I hope that they will be relieved to see that this convention is appropriately shifting its focus and putting the country first, to borrow a McCain campaign expression, even at the expense at the kind of mo' you'd like to see coming out of a Republican convention.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain may not get much of a lift from a convention overshadowed by storms, but between Gustav and McCain's surprise pick of Palin, Obama likely had his bounce diminished, too. A new CBS national poll found Obama's lead had grown from three points to eight points after the Democratic National Convention last week, but a CNN poll showed the race was a statistical tie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If McCain hoped to use the convention to fire up party activists and the conservative base, that became unnecessary because the selection of Palin already accomplished that. A staunch social conservative, Palin remains a giant question mark, but most delegates in St. Paul are ecstatic to have her on the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of the doubts about McCain from the hard core conservatives are erased,'' said Pasco GOP chairman Bill Bunting, predicting that she could get activists as enthusiastic as they were for Bush-Cheney in 2004. &quot;She'll turn out the conservative base, and they're the ones that work the hardest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican activists are sounding as excited as they've been in months. Republican leaders are showing competence and empathy, and McCain no longer has to fret so much about how his acceptance speech will be compared to Obama's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even without a full-fledged convention, this could still be a good week for McCain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;A Nuclear Bull's-Eye Is On Our Back&quot; (Other Views, Aug. 26):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Totten erroneously states that the effect of a nuclear reactor attack by a wide-bodied aircraft would be &quot;comparable&quot; to that of a one-megaton nuclear blast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tests performed two decades ago, in which a jet fighter was crashed into a concrete block at 481 mph, indicated negligible damage to a containment building facing a similar situation. Later studies likewise eliminated commercial airliners as a potential threat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Totten's anachronistic stance is better suited to the fear-mongering propaganda of the Cold War era. Nuclear power is clean, safe and contributes less indirect greenhouse gases in its lifetime than either solar or wind power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly these sources deserve additional research, but while Totten and others like him speak out against a currently available, viable source of energy for our nation, another coal plant is spewing tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Political Discourse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mental picture of local Republicans, poison pens at the ready, waiting to pounce on Barack Obama's choice for vice president is mildly amusing (Letters, Aug. 26). Obama could have chosen Mother Teresa, and these right-wingers would have said she's a liberal who works with terrorist sympathizers. Such is the political discourse in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have the one-issue reader who thinks abortion is the only thing plaguing this country. Republicans are so joyously protective of the fetus in the womb, but, hey kid, once you're born, you're on your own; or as they call it, &quot;personal responsibility.&quot; Which means cut all social programs so they can give yet another tax break to the incredibly wealthy, yet call them middle-class families and let the poor starve in the hedgerows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Biden is a safe choice for Obama. Is it an inspired choice? No. It is a political one. It shores up his foreign policy holes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religion And Politics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find the piece by Cal Thomas titled &quot;A Very Civil Forum&quot; (Other Views, Aug. 26) incredible because of its hubris. People like Thomas, Rick Warren, Osama bin Laden and many religious people feel that their idea of the truth is the only one and that they must impose it upon the rest of the world. What they do not seem to realize is that their behavior is part of the problem, not part of the solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christians, along with the rest of us I am sure, felt the tragedy of 9/11. But what they seem not to understand is that their mindset is no different from that of the Muslims who flew those planes into the towers. One only has to pick up a world history book to find that religion has been a source of conflict because one group was trying to impose its idea of the truth on an opposing group which too felt it had the only truth. Therefore, the religious beliefs of a presidential candidate should not be an issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only issue is that the candidate realizes he must operate within the framework of the laws of the United States and to accomplish that duty religion is not essential.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding Leonard Pitts' column &quot;Clarity Is Good, Wisdom Is Better&quot; (Other Views, Aug. 23):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pitts contrasts the performances of senators Obama and McCain at the Saddleback Church debate/event. In an attempt to appear evenhanded, Pitts states that McCain gave the &quot;more impressive performance.&quot; Before drawing his next breath he expressed concern that the &quot;stark simplicity&quot; of McCain's answers will be mistaken &quot;for wisdom&quot; by viewers, and waxed eloquent about Obama's &quot;thoughtful and nuanced&quot; answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not a columnist, but I think most viewers found Obama's answers an exercise in the lawyerly art of designing answers to conceal positions and to offend the fewest registered voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's &quot;stark simplicity&quot; that Pitts worries will be mistaken &quot;for wisdom&quot; by viewers, is the honesty that clarity provides.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bear Out Of Hibernation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hibernation process of a bear is quite fascinating. He is really not asleep, but getting ready, building up his strength for life in the coming season. And so it is with our Russian friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putin and his gang have been preparing for this first excursion into reclaiming members of the old USSR. Make no mistake, Georgia is just the first. The Russian hibernation included a long-term plan to distribute and sell their oil and natural gas for cash to buy arms for their own military, making sure NATO countries knew of their extensive nuclear weapons stash - might that be intimidation, and moving arms to Iraqi fundamentalists ensuring Russia looks good to Muslim nations who were part of the Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether we like it or not, we are right in the center of a worldwide power struggle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Pact Would Pull U.S. Troops From Iraqi Cities By July&quot; (Nation/World, Aug. 21):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what. Are we now to get all excited about how well the war has gone because in nine months we can expect to begin withdrawing soldiers from Iraqi cities? Excuse me for not starting the parade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess someday we will leave and someday all the buildings destroyed will be rebuilt and someday all the displaced civilians may return home and that is supposed to make the removal of one inept dictator a noble effort. In my book it looks more like Russia's intervention in Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you act like your enemies, you are no different. I only hope the next president remembers we should be a beacon of light not a bully who excuses torture and an invasion in the belief it is OK because they do it, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We used to be able to say we were better than they were. Unfortunately, that is no longer possible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our Options Are Limited</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tribune's Aug. 16 editorial-page cartoon of &quot;the Obama response&quot; was obviously intended to encourage McCain supporters in their criticisms: Obama sits calmly while the Russian bear upsets a chess board. However, it's interesting to speculate on how a cartoon of &quot;the McCain response&quot; might look. In that one, McCain would be wildly waving his arms in threatening gestures, while the Russian bear calmly checkmated him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush adventure in Iraq has effectively removed any possibility of military threat from the arsenal of American foreign policy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor Day is a day to honor the working men and women of America. Nowadays, the poverty levels in urban areas are scandalous. Many wage-earners cannot find work, and even if they do, incomes are too low to support their families. Inflationary realities across the board have become incredible: gas and energy costs, housing, insurance, taxes, medical and dental care, food, etc. The deterioration of their circumstances has resulted in foreclosures, bankruptcies, more homeless people, ad infinitum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working-class Americans need well-paying jobs and a health care system that provides effective treatment at affordable costs. Cheaper housing must materialize if we are to improve the conditions and wellbeing of all working-class citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Future Labor Days should be celebrated with a renewed idealism that puts the working class on the same level of respect and continuity of consideration as the affluent and corporate sectors of our country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor Day is a holiday set aside to give our nation the opportunity to pause and celebrate the American worker. However, there is one member of the country's workforce that is often overlooked - the construction industry craft professional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historically, Labor Day is associated with labor unions, but it is actually a day to honor all workers, regardless of labor affiliation. The Labor Department reports that in 2007 only 13 percent of the workers in the construction industry were members of a labor union. The majority of construction workers - 87 percent - have chosen not to belong to a labor union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few industries touch our daily lives in so many meaningful ways, and no part of our environment exists without the sweat, hard work and dedication of the American construction craft professional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I grew up during the Great Depression. I stood in bread lines with my dad. I recoil at the prospect of another economic tragedy. On the article &quot;Lessons of the Great Depression&quot; (Commentary, Aug. 24), I must differ with some of author Amity Shlaes' conclusions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shlaes pans FDR, a man elected four times to the presidency. Roosevelt inherited a mess from the Republicans. The WPA was created to keep Americans from starving. To say that these emergency programs retarded private enterprise is irresponsible. Private enterprise benefited, then and now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulations are not necessarily bad. Without them flourish greedy, crooked financial institutions. Our airlines are suffering due to deregulation pushed by Ronald Reagan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's 2008 and once again a new president will inherit a mess from a Republican administration. Can John McCain solve it? I don't think so. And Barack Obama? With expert help, maybe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Housing Still A Mess</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the housing and credit problems continue, the Congress and Federal Reserve Board continue to make efforts to improve these issues - mostly working to pass legislation and create policy that will encourage the homebuyer back into the market. Most analysts agree that the problem starts and ends with the housing market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, as an industry insider I can tell you the meat of these actions have failed to produce the desired response. Lenders continue to tighten credit standards and eliminating programs that were profitable and were effectively risk managed for decades prior to the housing boom and bust. Underwriting must return to reasonable assessment of risks and not overreact and thereby escalate the problem further.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The time appears to have arrived for the replacement of Lex Salisbury as the president of our Lowry Park Zoo. His recent dealings with Safari Wild have begun to raise questions about his motives and ethics. While he has done much to improve and promote the zoo in the past, recent decisions and activities have begun to shift the focus of the zoo from animals to rides and retail sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am an annual member at a level which offers the opportunity, occasionally, to see behind the scenes and participate in activities that are not available to daily visitors. In the past two or three years I have become more and more uncomfortable with the direction the zoo seems to be headed. I do not want to see it become another Busch Gardens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No more rides or retail sales space. Let's keep the focus on animals, their protection and the education of us humans about them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mountain Out Of Molehill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to take issue with several points that you made in your overwrought Aug. 23 editorial &quot;HCC President Lost Her Way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First of all, the entire incident strikes me as making a mountain from a molehill. You admit that an Atlanta firm was paid well to investigate the bidders and to make sure the bidding process was aboveboard. The deal ultimately did not go through, so what exactly did the college do that was so horrible, other than pursue a public-private partnership of which you clearly disapprove?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, you cited one study that shows a low graduation rate at the college and you translated that into a sneering comment about &quot;poor academic performance.&quot; But a lower graduation rate could just as easily reflect higher academic standards or any of a hundred other factors. Why not check and see how HCC graduates do in the work force or how they compare with other students when they transfer to USF or other state universities?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, even if you are convinced that the HCC administration made a serious error in judgment in this instance, your attack on Dr. Gwen Stephenson is far out of proportion when measured against her achievements here.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what might be his most controversial attack ad in a campaign dominated by them, presumptive GOP presidential nominee John McCain today launched a new TV spot attacking Sen. Barack Obama's two children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to political insiders, a negative ad targeting a rival's offspring is highly unorthodox, especially when the children in question are under the age of 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after the two Obama kids scored in their performance on national television last week at the Democratic convention, &quot;we had to do something to give the American people some straight talk on those two brats,&quot; Sen. McCain said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ad, which is being broadcast in key swing states, an announcer intones, &quot;They're the cutest children in the world - but are they ready to lead?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spot uses visuals to link the two Obama kids to other famously cute kids, such as the young Drew Barrymore and the Cabbage Patch dolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial goes on to blast the Obama children for &quot;smiling and giggling but refusing to state their position on offshore oil drilling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some critics questioned how well the ad would play in living rooms across America, Sen. McCain defended it, telling reporters, &quot;It played very well in all of my living rooms.&quot;</SPAN></P>

With fast-approaching voter registration deadlines in key states, the campaign is furiously using its high-tech gadgetry and vast databases to make sure potential Obama supporters are registered. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;As he makes history, Obama calls on America to revive its promise.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forty five years to the day after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told America about his dream of racial equality, Barack Obama accepted the Democratic nomination for president of the United States, pledging a new direction for a troubled nation while warning that his Republican opponent offers only small-minded, partisan solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking Thursday night to more than 84,000 people in an open air football stadium, with millions more watching on TV, the first African-American nominee of a major party largely dispensed with the soaring rhetoric that fueled his extraordinary rise. Instead, Obama bluntly spoke of a defining moment for America, and cast Republican John McCain as a dinosaur who &quot;doesn't get it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight. On Nov. 4, we must stand up and say: Eight is enough.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the most important speech of the Illinois senator's life, a chance to explain to voters now tuning in to the dead-heat presidential race who he is, what he intends to do and how, contrary to the elitist caricature, he understands middle class Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach,&quot; Obama said, before an Invesco Field filled with waving American flags.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed presidency of George W. Bush. America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acceptance speech capped the four-day convention where the party strove to put behind it tensions lingering from the marathon primary between Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton and give America a convincing show of unity. The Clintons passed the baton to Obama earlier in the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the man George W. Bush barely beat eight years ago also took the stage. Al Gore, the former vice-president, recounted how in 2000 many voters said there was little difference between the candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here we all are in 2008, and I doubt anyone would argue now that election didn't matter. Take it from me, if it had ended differently, we would not be bogged down in Iraq - we would have pursued bin Laden until we captured him. We would not be facing a self-inflicted economic crisis - we would be fighting for middle income families,&quot; Gore said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000, though it may be even more obvious now, because John McCain, a man who has earned our respect on many levels, is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush-Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them,'' Gore said. &quot;The same policies all over again? Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A line more than 2 miles long snaked from downtown Denver toward Invesco Field, a spectacular human bottleneck that persisted even as Gore took the stage at 6:45 p.m. local time. But the groans and complaints were drowned out by the wild cheers of those who made it in. Virtually everyone was given a small American flag, a prop clearly intended to blunt questions about Obama's patriotism and family background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No presidential nominee has given his acceptance speech in an open air stadium since John F. Kennedy in 1960, at the Los Angeles Coliseum. The campaign hoped it would underscore Obama's intent to open up the process well beyond political insiders and elites, but the move presented real risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns about rain proved unfounded, but some Democrats also worried the giant crowd would feed the criticism from the McCain campaign that Obama is flush with adoring fans but light on substance. The campaign installed a columned stage resembling an ancient Greek Temple to give a more conventional backdrop on TV, and that only prompted ridicule from Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, though, the McCain campaign also released a TV ad recognizing the significance of Obama accepting the nomination on the 45th anniversary of King's &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama, this is truly a good day for America,'' McCain said in the ad. &quot;Too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed. So I wanted to stop and say, congratulations. How perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day. Tomorrow, we'll be back at it. But tonight, Senator, job well done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most every Obama campaign event doubles as an organizing effort, and the Invesco Field appearance was no exception. The campaign asked people to send text messages to friends about Obama - bringing more than 30,000 electronic addresses back to the campaign - and organized speech-watching parties across the country, including 300 in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show a widespread dissatisfaction with the direction of the country, but with the presidential race neck-and-neck, Obama needs to reach the roughly 15 percent of the electorate still unsure about the 47-year-old freshman senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many say they want him to flesh out with specifics his vague calls for change, and Obama made an effort Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the startups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow,&quot; he said. &quot;I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95 percent of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama didn't mention his plan to raise taxes on upper income Americans to pay for programs, including expanded health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as president: in 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama often laments the negative tone of politics today, but he sharply attacked McCain as a candidate who is stuck in the past and riding a false image as a maverick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Sen. McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the 45th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s &quot;I Have a Dream'' speech, Barack Obama created a new chapter in the political and social history of this nation. The 47-year-old Illinois senator became the first African-American to accept a major political party's nomination for president, an accomplishment that not so many years ago seemed unimaginable. Obama closed the Democratic National Convention Thursday night in spectacular fashion, delivering a soaring speech about change in America before more than 84,000 cheering supporters in a Denver football stadium. You did not have to squint to see the mountaintops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a moment to remember, before the fall campaign battles over energy policy and health care and the Iraq war and the economy. Obama has talked about a campaign that transcends race. The reality is that racial issues have not disappeared from this election or from society. After all, much of this convention week was spent reassuring voters that the Obama family shares their values and their love of this country. Yet all Americans who have lived through less enlightened eras can appreciate the social progress that has made it possible for the son of a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya to be a step away from the presidency. In a gracious television ad, Sen. John McCain, who will accept the Republican nomination for president next week, called it &quot;truly a good day for America.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama became the first presidential candidate to accept the nomination in a large outdoor stadium since John F. Kennedy in 1960. The elaborate staging fueled new criticism that he is more rock star than well-grounded public servant. But those who listened to Obama's words heard a message that should resonate in the living rooms and kitchens of middle-class Americans nervous about their jobs, their mortgages and the futures of their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He summed up a nation at war and in economic turmoil, then spoke directly to voters: &quot;More Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach.'' He blamed Washington and the Bush administration for failing to respond and declared, &quot;America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who can disagree?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no surprises or bold initiatives in Obama's acceptance speech. He laid out his proposals on taxes and energy and sought to rebut Republican charges that Democrats are weak on national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country,'' he said. &quot;As commander in chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama praised John McCain for the &quot;bravery and distinction'' of his military service but pressed his central line of attack against his Republican rival - that McCain offers little more than four more years of George W. Bush's failed domestic and foreign policies. Despite McCain's record as a maverick, Obama said his opponent had voted Bush's position 90 percent of the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush was right more than 90 percent of the time?'' Obama said. &quot;I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were some special moments in Denver. U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois, passionately connecting the historical lines between King and Obama. Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, the old liberal lion recovering from brain surgery, roaring &quot;there is a new wave of change all around us'' and linking the legacies of his late brothers to the Democratic nominee. A gracious, upbeat Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton urging those Democrats who supported her own historic campaign for the presidency to embrace Obama as the candidate who could carry on the fight for the issues they most care about, from health care to education. If it turns out the former first lady did not convince them all, it will not be for a lack of trying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are on the same team,'' she said, &quot;and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines. ... Barack Obama is my candidate, and he must be our president.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there were mixed signals and missed opportunities as well. The first two days of the convention felt like the last gasps of a long, difficult primary season. A convention devoted to change featured many of the familiar Democratic interest groups, from union bosses to abortion rights activists. Former President Clinton won points for delivery but delivered a mishmash of economic and foreign policy that would have been more powerful if it had been more focused. Speaker after speaker linked McCain to President Bush, but beyond running mate Joe Biden, few drew clear contrasts between McCain and Obama. Another round of opinion polls will have to gauge whether the Clintons closed the divide between some of their most ardent supporters and the party nominee's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of those maneuverings will be political footnotes. Barack Obama's rise to the Democratic nomination for president, regardless of the outcome of the November election, will be forever linked to the dreams the Rev. King spoke of so long ago and a historic milestone in American politics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Kaye Jiloty sat in the back of the room for the morning meeting of the Florida delegates at the Red Lion Hotel, wearing a Hillary Rodham Clinton button and a pained expression. This is her first Democratic National Convention, and she expects it will be her last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 56-year-old middle-school Spanish teacher from Ormond Beach is a delegate for the former first lady. But it will be Barack Obama who accepts the Democratic nomination for president Thursday night. Jiloty, like many other women who supported Clinton, has yet to come to grips with the idea of embracing Obama for president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just don't feel that being welcomed,'' she said. &quot;It's been more, 'You better come on board or else.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tension between the Obama and Clinton camps is the subplot of this convention, stoked by the media with little else to blog about and Republicans with too much time on their hands before their convention next week. Clinton gave a very warm speech to wild applause Tuesday night and said all of the right things. Former President Bill Clinton is to speak tonight, and the roll call vote could provide some intrigue depending upon how many Clinton votes are cast and how much noise her supporters make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Old Democratic hands, from former Sen. Bob Graham to Broward Democratic Party chairman Mitch Ceasar, downplay the divisions and the potential for any lasting harm. But opinion polls suggest a different story. A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll shows just two-thirds of Clinton's supporters in the primary back Obama now, and 27 percent say they will vote for McCain. For Obama, those numbers have to get a lot better by November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means winning over voters such as Jiloty, one of six sisters who was looking forward to helping elect the first woman president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would have been quite a moment,'' she said. &quot;Quite a moment.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is Jiloty's first foray into national politics. A longtime fan of Sen. Clinton, she started making phone calls to learn about becoming a convention delegate as soon as it became clear the former first lady would be running for president. She attended a workshop for delegates sponsored by the state party. Over her Christmas break, she spent 10 cold days in Iowa as a Clinton volunteer, driving around Clinton surrogates and making telephone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a campaign season that began with so much excitement for Jiloty now has left her somewhat disillusioned. She did not like the way the national party punished Florida and Michigan for moving up their primary elections, even though Florida's full delegation has prime seats now in the Pepsi Center. She is still upset over some of the primary campaign attacks on Clinton. And now she does not feel Clinton and her supporters are being treated with the proper respect by the Obama camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jiloty wants to vote for Clinton during the roll call tonight but is waiting to hear Clinton speak to her committed delegates today and for the negotiations between the two camps to play out. After all, she points out, Clinton received more than 38,000 votes in her congressional district. She feels an obligation to those voters to see it through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After this week, though, Jiloty is done. She does not plan to be an active volunteer in the general election campaign. There will be no Obama bumper sticker on her car. And she does not expect to attend another national political convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton told reporters this week she will continue to make the case for Democrats to come together and back Obama. She predicted that after voters examine the policy differences between Obama and Republican John McCain, Democrats will rally behind the Illinois senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People have perhaps different paths to get there,'' Clinton said, &quot;but we will be united.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jiloty isn't there yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will she vote in November?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will she vote for Obama?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She won't commit, but notes she signed a loyalty oath not to oppose the party nominee or support his opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will she vote for McCain?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to go there - yet.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;She makes the rounds for unity, but the clamor for the beaten nominee is rousing.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't going to be easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, vanquished nominee, marked the opening day of the Democratic National Convention by diving headlong into her role as a top ambassador for Sen. Barack Obama, it remained far from certain that Democrats will leave town Friday much more unified than they were when they arrived Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls continue to show that as many as one of four Clinton supporters don't plan to vote for Obama for president, and several pro-Clinton groups, including 18 Million Voices, are planning a march and rally in downtown Denver today. Hillary Clinton buttons are nearly as popular as Obama-wear among delegates and party activists here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd love to think that Hillary supporters will be able to support Obama without hesitation, but for a lot of Hillary supporters I've heard, they're very reluctant,&quot; said Tyler Clendenin, 27, a web developer from Tampa and a member of the convention rules committee who wore both Clinton and Obama buttons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a gathering of the Clinton-friendly National Hispanic Caucus on Monday morning, Clinton warned that Sen. John McCain and the Republican Party were trying to exploit the rift &quot;to divide us, divert us from what's really at stake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, McCain campaign workers passed out fliers downtown Monday inviting people to a &quot;Happy Hour for Hillary&quot; at a local cafe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign also began airing a TV spot that features a woman named Debra Bartoshevich saying she is a &quot;proud Hillary Clinton Democrat&quot; who plans to back McCain because &quot;now he's the one with experience and judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Democrats will vote McCain,&quot; she says in the ad. &quot;It's okay, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the convention opened with the theme &quot;One Nation,&quot; Clinton and other top Democrats were making the rounds among delegates to convince them that no, it's not okay. Clinton is scheduled to address the convention tonight, when she'll make a prime-time pitch for unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Clinton will hold a meeting with her delegates (whose number nearly equals that of Obama), where she is likely to release them so they can pledge their support for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That evening, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, is scheduled to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet even her appearances around Denver - where she's dipping in and out of meetings with Democratic activists to preach the gospel of Obama - seemed to highlight the division, rather than the solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the Hispanic Caucus meeting, where she drove the crowd wildwith a surprise visit before lunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The members, representing Hispanics from Florida to California, drowned out her introduction with applause and chants of &quot;Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!&quot; and refused to sit when she launched into the reasons they should vote for the Democratic nominee: from health care to the environment, Obama would best represent their interests, not McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I am asking you, those of you who supported me, I would be forever grateful if you work as hard for Barack Obama as you worked for me,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheers followed. Along with more chants of &quot;Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's campaign is all about looking forward, but as Democrats opened their convention Monday, a bitter memory loomed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Kerry, the nominee in 2004, spent most of the convention in Boston talking about himself and his Vietnam War record rather than going after President Bush. The flaccid approach mystified and angered many Democrats who felt the climate was perfect to retake the White House. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not this year, Democrats say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Obama must be careful not to contradict his message of optimism and change and plans to highlight his own biography, advisers say the convention will draw stark contrasts with his opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to make it abundantly clear this week that John McCain offers more of the same on the economy, on health care on the Karl Rove-style politics,&quot; Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said Monday. &quot;Barack Obama offers the change America needs; John McCain offers more of the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Sadosky, a McCain campaign spokesman, responded: &quot;The American public knows John McCain is a maverick and independent who puts his country first, before any allegiance for a political party. The Obama campaign cannot say the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more forceful approach was evident immediately as the convention speeches began Monday afternoon. &quot;We cannot afford four more years of the same failed policies,&quot; said convention CEO Leah Daughtry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need Barack Obama. ...He's done more to change the course of this country in four short years than John McCain has done in 26 long years,&quot; said Grace Napolitano, D-California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next three days, Democrats say they will keep up the attack, charging Republicans with pursuing tax cuts for the wealthy, for inadequately addressing the housing crisis and for failing to develop a detailed plan to get troops out of Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama needs to draw a sharp contrast,&quot; said state Sen. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, one of Florida's' 211 delegates. &quot;It can be done without being vitriolic, and that's what we expect him to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry's problems only intensified after the convention, as Republicans ramped up their attacks on his war record, most vividly with commercials featuring fellow swift boat veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Determined not to be &quot;swift-boated,&quot; the Obama campaign has been quick to respond to McCain's attack ads and gone on the offensive with its own hard-hitting TV spots.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a frightening habit among the Bay area's drivers: A large majority isn't turning on their headlights in rainy weather. I've noticed that this has become more of the rule rather than the exception over the last five to 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Statute 316.217(1) (b) requires that operators of motor vehicles turn their headlights on during rain in Florida. I think it's a shame that people need to be reminded of this. These drivers become virtually invisible to other drivers during a heavy downpour without their lights on, especially in the summertime. They might as well be driving at night without them on as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I drive about 70 miles a day back and forth to work, and I estimate that about 75 percent of the drivers on the road the other day during a rainstorm didn't have their lights on. What a scary situation. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made a great choice in Joe Biden. Both are great public speakers; both are well-educated. And if that's all you're looking for in leadership, then I guess you've found your team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither man should speak about family values: Both adamantly support abortion. Biden calls himself a Catholic; Obama follows some religion but knowing/believing when the soul enters a fetus is &quot;way beyond him.&quot; Obama clearly wants to be the &quot;abortion president.&quot; How's that for a goal? But he calls himself a &quot;uniter.&quot; Who does he plan to unite?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disappointing Choice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a ludicrously disappointing choice for vice president Barack Obama made with his selection of Sen. Joe Biden from Delaware! This war horse has seen his better days, and his only credentials are his antiwar stance and his abiding love for the United Nations. Also, he suffers from an interminable case of foot-in-mouth disease that has plagued him throughout his political career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and company must be bursting with glee over this tired choice. It has gone a long way in securing for the GOP another four years in the White House.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst the predictable &quot;Huzzahs&quot; for Joe Biden's selection by Obama, does anyone remember that the Delaware senator huffed and puffed his way into the hearts of a whopping 1 percent of Democrat primary voters?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, who realizes that Biden is even less popular among women than Obama, who is some 10 points below the norm for a Democrat in a presidential race?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, if Washington is as broken as Obama says, and Congress' job approval is even lower than the president's, why would Biden, a 36-year lifer in the Senate, be a wise choice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I say the door is wide open for John McCain to make a far wiser VP choice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain Is Too Old?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find Obama's VP choice so funny. They pin McClain as too old, but Biden is 65! They pin McCain as a Washington insider, but Biden has been a career Washington politician for over 30 years - longer than McClain! Plus Biden voted for the war in 2003. He ran for president in the Democratic primaries and never lasted long. Biden at times is more of a Republican-thinking senator than Democratic. Obama could not have picked a better person to lose the election with.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doesn't Signal Change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So everyone thinks that Sen. Obama is the candidate of change? Well, with this pick he shows he is anything but. He is just another everyday politician who is realizing that he's not qualified to hold the presidency and is desperately picking a running mate with more experience to offset his complete lack thereof. Picking a man who's been in Washington for 35 years does not signal a candidate for change, just more of the same - without the experience.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On AM 860, it's Bill Bennett in the morning, then Laura Ingraham, followed by Michael Medved and Hugh Hewitt in the evening. On AM 970, it's Rush Limbaugh, with Todd Schnitt for the evening commute. On AM 1040, the team is Mark Larsen, Dennis Miller and Michael Savage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can only reason that it's because AM radio is big business, and big business means Republican. I'm tired of it and no longer turn it on. The Republicans speak of media bias on television, but they certainly rule the radio.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for publishing the rantings of another New York Times looney-tune columnist. Professional Bush-basher Maureen Dowd has not only &quot;left&quot; the building, she's exited reality altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dowd uses her &quot;opinion&quot; to fabricate the clandestine meeting of John McCain and Hillary Clinton sitting together, tossing back Stolies and plotting to steal the election from Obama. After a few more Stolies, the deal is cut. Bill and Hill will help John if he agrees to one term only. Hillary gets the next two!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Dowd attempts to pass as satire is nothing more than a political ad. She is so in the tank with &quot;Twig Legs&quot; (her words) that she has lost all journalistic credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Way to go Maureen; Bob Woodward would be proud of you for uncovering this one.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tribune Has Vendetta</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me state up front that although I am a volunteer poll worker, I do not personally know Buddy Johnson, Hillsborough County supervisor of elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I didn't know better, I would suspect that The Tampa Tribune really has a vendetta against Johnson. Surely a paper with any desirable reputation at all wouldn't use their position in the community to continually attack an elected official unless there was really something there to attack, would they?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that at least once or twice a month there is a venomous, tabloid-type attack in your paper against the man. Each new article starts out making some kind of accusation against Johnson, but as one continues to read the article one is reminded of the old hamburger commercial where the little old lady is yelling, &quot;Where's the beef?&quot; (And before you go there, I know the whole story about Johnson's small herd of cattle grazing on his farm).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, either show us the beef or get over it. Each time you print one of these baseless attack articles you make yourself look more and more like the National Enquirer and less and less like the reputable paper that you once were.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By SILVIO LACCETTI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the time of Homer's heroic, swift-footed Achilles, the best of the best have sought the immortality of fame and glory. Today, 3,000 years later, thanks to the internet, the rest of mankind can obtain a good dose of fame - if not glory - via some key stroking. A new-found dimension of celebrity has even become a presidential campaign issue, what with John McCain's recent ad about his rival and the unexpected Paris Hilton rejoinder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As much as it is about information, the Internet is also about people. It makes them, their accomplishments and their reputations larger than life. Even you can carve out a little cyber-pyramid - be your own pharaoh. A monument to your achievements can be erected on facebooks, my spaces, YouTubes and all around the blogosphere. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the law of cybernet multiplication, a few small achievements can make you a cyberstar. Clusters of accomplishments make you a supernova. Fame and glory become exponential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Webworld fame, no one comes close to Senator Barack Obama. On Yahoo, there are almost 1 billion citations under Obama, probably all but a very, very small percentage relating to the man in some way. The late John Lennon could fairly have said that Obama is more popular than Jesus - 607 million citations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quick check on Yahoo reveals these startling results in terms of references: The Beatles, 153 million (how the mighty have fallen); Hillary Clinton, 139 million (fallen, but she'll get up again); Oprah, 86.5 million (only?); Britney Spears, 216 million (you go girl!); Michael Jordan, 95 million (more endorsements needed?); Alex Rodriguez, 37.9 million (they pay him more money than that); Hitler, 127 million (is he dead yet?). Surprisingly, George W. Bush has 223 million (what low approval rating?).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case you were wondering, Obama is not more popular than God, Who has 1.4 billion sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did the senator from Illinois become such a megaWeb star politician/celebrity? Of course, he has accomplished a great deal. So apply the law of cybernet multiplication. Beyond that there are factors unique to the Obama phenomenon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one thing, all forms of media have become Obamatized, seeking every opportunity to expound upon him. A &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; comedy sketch sharply satirized this condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps his very name is like a talisman. On a recent Monday &quot;headline news&quot; segment, Jay Leno displayed one that said Obama was gaining ground on Obama in South Dakota! Even presumably unfriendly outlets, like Fox News.com are not immune to this strange reporting. Recently, Fox highlighted its daily top five political stories. Four mentioned Obama in the pithy headline. One of the four was actually a McCain story in which his opponent's name also appeared for no necessary reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, Internet fame and cyber-celebrity will not be enough to win a presidential election, insure good leadership or bring necessary change to the American political landscape. The glory of the Web can be clicked off, shut down and maybe even terminated. The candidates know this and so do the bulk of America's voters. That is why the race is a virtual tie despite the celebrity factor. Both candidates must get down explaining their positions clearly, continually and unwaveringly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;All eyes are on the Democrats, and the candidate's task is to get people to envision him as president.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget the buzz about John McCain as the new Bob Dole, and especially the talk that Democrats have a lock on the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week the presidential race really begins, and as Barack Obama prepares to accept the Democratic nomination in Denver, his election looks anything but inevitable. Recent conventional wisdom that the GOP faced an insurmountable head wind has given way to a dead heat and widespread anxiety among Democrats wondering why their candidate isn't comfortably in the lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think the race is so much about the political climate,&quot; said Rep. Allen Boyd, D-Monticello, whose Panhandle district President Bush won by nearly 20 points in 2004. &quot;I think it's really about Barack Obama and John McCain.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And right now the polls show a neck-and-neck race where Obama has serious challenges ahead despite the anti-Republican sentiment in America: Nearly half of Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters aren't yet sold on the Democratic nominee and a sizable chunk of the electorate views him as a distant, foreign figure without a clear agenda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's exciting, he's likeable, he's a great campaigner, but then what?'' said Miami lawyer Ira Leesfield, a top Clinton fundraiser who now supports Obama but is no longer aggressively raising money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think this election is going to be decided on personality or how great you are. It's going to be about leadership and how great these candidates are as problem-solvers. I see this as being a real race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeking comfort level</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's fashionable to say that nominating conventions are meaningless four-day campaign commercials. In fact, they are thoroughly scripted shows that still matter a lot - especially when the nominee is a newcomer with an exotic biography with whom many voters have yet to feel comfortable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boiled down, that comfort level is what Obama needs from the convention that starts Monday with speeches by family members fleshing out his story and concludes Thursday when America, on the anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, watches the first African-American to accept a presidential nomination of a major party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama will largely own the airwaves this week, making it the Illinois senator's best and last chance to tell America who he is and where he wants to take the country in challenging times for the economy and national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a pretty simple race actually. If people can envision Barack Obama as president, I think he will win pretty handily,'' said Democratic National Committee member Allan Katz of Tallahassee. &quot;A lot of people don't know who he is, and the convention gives him the opportunity to articulate to the American people who he is and what he wants to do as president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday's addition of Delaware Sen. Joe Biden to the ticket may also offer some reassurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Needle won't move</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are plenty of reasons for Obama supporters to worry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since June, Obama has spent at least $7.4-million on TV ads in America's biggest battleground state, compared to zero for McCain. He has also launched an unprecedented voter persuasion and mobilization effort in Florida, with hundreds of paid staffers and campaign offices opening in places that haven't ever seen a Democratic presidential nominee campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result? Polls show he hasn't moved the needle and, if anything, has lost a little ground. The average of Florida polls compiled by RealClearPolitics.com shows McCain up 2.6 percentage points, compared to a tie one month ago. Nationally, polls show Obama's lead cut in half, to about 3 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It takes 270 electoral votes to win, and RealClear's polling averages show Obama currently with 228 solid electoral votes, McCain with 174, and 136 up for grabs in toss-up states like Florida, Ohio, Colorado and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama has an image problem, and I think it was one that was created at the very beginning by being very successful motivating people and leading them down a path, but at the end of that path he turned out to be not what was promised,&quot; said Florida Republican chairman Jim Greer, arguing that Obama has never provided a specific vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The potential for us winning I think is greater than (the Democrats),&quot; Greer said, &quot;but it's going to require us to be at the top of our game, particularly in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking for bounce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preconvention polls are dubious predictors, however. In 1992, some polls showed Bill Clinton in third place behind George Bush and Ross Perot. In 1988, Michael Dukakis was comfortably ahead prior to the conventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is there a solid gauge for a reasonable postconvention boost in the polls. The pollsters at Gallup say the average convention &quot;bounce&quot; in modern elections is five points, but four years ago President Bush and John Kerry received little or no lift in the polls. This year, with compressed back-to-back conventions, and the likelihood that McCain will name his running mate just as the Democrats leave Denver, public opinion shifts could be minimal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, turnout models in this election are entirely unpredictable, with the Obama campaign painstakingly working to mobilize infrequent or first-time young and minority voters. In the crucial battleground states, anywhere from 10 percent to 25 percent of voters are undecided and waiting for the kinds of campaign-shaping developments just now kicking off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone ought to just take a breath. We've got some major moments ahead,'' said Obama national campaign manager David Plouffe. &quot;They're both going to do VPs, we've got both party conventions, we've got four debates in the fall. And what we find is a lot of these undecided voters, they're paying attention but they're going to click in a major way soon, and we'll see how the dust settles. But I think states like Florida, states like Virginia, states like Ohio and some of the Western states, they're going to be close throughout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reality setting in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the story line developing last spring about a Democratic landslide probably never made sense. Whether the Democrat was the polarizing first female nominee or a black man named Barack Hussein Obama, did a blowout ever seem realistic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's the political climate and there's partisanship in the country. The partisanship is not really different from four years ago or eight years ago,'' said Florida-based Democratic pollster Dave Beattie. &quot;No one's going to walk away with the presidential race in an open race. Given the partisanship in this country, that's not going to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, given Obama's fundraising success ($389-million to McCain's $174-million), enthusiasm and the country's hunger for change, anxious Democrats enter the next crucial phase of the election better positioned than they've been in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is Obama's moment to seize the momentum, but Democrats have scant assurance that he can do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm hopeful. I think the die has not been cast,'' said T. Wayne Bailey, a Stetson University political scientist and longtime Democratic activist who has been to nine Democratic conventions. &quot;Probably in this phase, the next four weeks and the decisions that are made will either create a bonding effect or it will create a centrifugal effect. But if I were in Reno, I'd still bet on Obama to win. If he can't win this election, the Democrats ought to have someone else write the script.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Political conventions and debates still do matter, and so does the choice of moderator.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Lehrer knows he's about as old-fashioned as a TV journalist can be these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a TV news universe where some figures spout commentary one minute and news reports the next, Lehrer insists staffers on his NewsHour broadcast avoid opinionating. As one of the three anchors picked to moderate a presidential debate this year - his 11th - Lehrer vows to avoid the attention-getting questions from previous debates, saying &quot;if people are talking about me or some question I have asked, then I have failed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when talk turns to the perennial question of whether so much journalism energy should be expended to cover the Democratic and Republican conventions with 15,000 journalists expected - Slate media columnist Jack Shafer is the latest to advocate a press boycott of the conventions this year as useless infomercials - Lehrer leaves no doubt about his own stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the beginning of finalizing the sale, is what it really boils down to,&quot; said Lehrer, who will lead PBS's convention coverage throughout prime time, starting at 8 p.m. and running until events end each evening. &quot;My guess is that the networks will regret the fact that they're not giving more coverage to it. Because people are going to be paying attention.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, these may be the most unsettled, settled political conventions in recent memory, with Democrat Barack Obama challenged to unify his supporters with those of former rival Hillary Clinton while Republican John McCain still struggles to energize the GOP's conservative base for his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if the nation's political parties are unsettled, so are the country's media outlets - straining to reconcile old-school journalism ethics with new demands for immediacy, passion and incisive reporting amid one of the most singular presidential races in history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coverage of the conventions will generally mirror the pattern set by the primary elections, with PBS, the Internet, National Public Radio and cable news channels providing the kind of continuous coverage political junkies might appreciate, while the big TV networks offer an hour of prime-time broadcasts at 10 p.m. each day with news breaks beforehand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Democratic gathering kicks off Monday in Denver (with the GOP convention scheduled Sept. 1 to 4 in Minneapolis), it's worth noting two trends that have emerged so far in campaign coverage, especially on TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trend 1: Obama gets more media coverage, but does it help him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers seem pretty straightforward, provided by a study of 48 different news outlets conducted each week by the Project for Excellence in Journalism. According to their figures, since Obama clinched the Democratic nomination in June, he has surfaced as a significant presence in 79 percent of stories, compared to 52 percent for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrat's domination of the news cycle is so complete, the Pew Research Center announced poll results Aug. 6 showing 48 percent of respondents felt they were hearing too much about Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juan Williams, an analyst for Fox News Channel and National Public Radio, sees coverage distorted by an infatuation with a singular candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been making decisions which are not rooted in journalism,&quot; said Williams, who recalled seeing news executives and nonworking journalists attending Obama events early in his campaign, just to see him make history. &quot;The main narrative has been: Barack Obama, superstar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other reporters say journalism is at the heart of the discrepancy, because Obama is a better story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has never been a candidate quite like him,&quot; said Ron Elving, senior political editor for National Public Radio. &quot;The big story from the journalism point of view was this new character - this would-be transformative figure who was more media-genic. I think it's just the nature of journalism to run around and pay a lot of attention to whatever is new and brings conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN national correspondent John King was less sanguine about the disparity, theorizing that local coverage of the candidates may be helping equalize the two candidates' poll numbers, simply by focusing on what they are saying in speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would argue that may be one reason why this campaign is closer than any historical data would indicate - McCain's local coverage has been about the arguments he wants to push forward,&quot; said King. &quot;Obama has been doing more newsworthy things than McCain. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be asking 'Are we slicing the pie fairly enough?' And fairly doesn't mean even.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts say Obama's domination of news coverage may hurt him because much of the reporting is negative. A recent study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs found that on-air evaluations of Obama during evening news shows on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News Channel in June and July were 72 percent negative, compared to 52 percent unfavorable for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Tellingly, the only week McCain scored equal news coverage with Obama was when he unleashed a torrent of attacks, including an ad comparing the Democrat to Paris Hilton.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media analyst Andrew Tyndall calls it &quot;reality game show-style journalism,&quot; in which Obama's dominance of the news cycle creates an environment where every little thing he does is treated as news, in an effort to see the man beneath the polished sound bites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who gets coverage when they shake hands with their wife?&quot; Tyndall said, referring to the flurry of stories about Obama's &quot;fist bump&quot; with wife Michelle. &quot;As long as there is this imbalance, the take-home message is that the media is framing this election as a referendum on Obama. And many political observers say that's what McCain wants it to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trend 2: Some of the biggest fights about media bias happen on the cable networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blending emotional commentary with news reporting has helped every cable news channel develop popular prime time shows. But it has also increased grousing about bias, from carping about MSNBC's decision to allow pundits Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann to anchor their primary coverage to objections over insulting headlines about Obama broadcast on Fox News Channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that MSNBC went so far over the line in terms of being in the tank to Barack Obama that it lost a lot of credibility,&quot; Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace told journalists during a July news conference. &quot;You've got someone like Keith Olbermann, who was delivering 10-minute screeds against President Bush. ... Our feeling is that opinionmakers should deliver their opinions and journalists should cover the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olbermann countered by noting that pundits such as Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity appeared during Fox News' primary coverage, disputing the channel's definition of anchoring a segment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're any good at this, you know when to express your opinions and when not to,&quot; said Olbermann, who nevertheless admitted his opinionated stands have probably ensured he's not a serious contender for the late Tim Russert's role as host of NBC's flagship political show Meet the Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I knew when I went off in my direction, that going back would be almost impossible,&quot; he said. &quot;I think I could do it and I could do it fairly, and I think people would be stunned by it. ... But I don't think people would buy into it, no matter how well I did it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, viewers must judge the impartiality of information based on the person delivering it to them, not the news outlet where it appears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is why PBS's Lehrer insists that separating the roles of commentator and news reporter remains important, so the audience retains trust when you deliver an uncertain story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think if they blur the lines too much they're going to lose some credibility when they really need it,&quot; he said. &quot;They're going to need it when there's a breaking news event and there are some struggling facts. ... I know I'm old-fashioned, but I think the route toward credibility and retaining credibility is to keep those separations there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, experts expect news coverage to become more evenly distributed after the conventions have ended, as the contest moves through the presidential and vice presidential debates into the final days before balloting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the beginning of the final act,&quot; said Lehrer. &quot;We have the two people there, one of whom is going to be the president of the United States, and a lot of people haven't paid attention to any of this stuff before. ... It's a new curtain going up for a whole new audience. Everybody will be there for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;As the presidential campaign becomes tenser and tougher, the half truths are on the rise.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the presidential campaign, truth has been a casualty of summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've rated more than 600 claims on our PolitiFact Web site since the campaign began and last week made an interesting discovery: The candidates, political parties and independent groups we've been rating have become significantly less truthful in the past two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before summer, we found that 65 percent of the claims we checked were on the upper end of our Truth-O-Meter, Half True, Mostly True or True, while 35 percent were on the bottom end - Barely True, False or Pants on Fire. That's not a great track record, but it's better than we would have expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The start of summer - which roughly coincided with the kickoff of the general election campaign between Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain - was a turning point. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, only 55 percent of the claims have earned a Half True or better, while 45 percent have been Barely True or lower. Those numbers aren't scientific because we choose the items to check based on our own curiosity about which statements are accurate. But they confirm our suspicions that the candidates have been stretching the truth more in the past two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest change has come in the number of claims we've rated Barely True. They accounted for 12 percent of our ratings before summer began, but 22 percent in the past two months. That reflects the unusually aggressive ads we've seen lately. It's only August, but on the campaign trail, it feels like October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In previous elections, the campaign slowed down during the summer, allowing everybody (especially voters) to get a break after the primary battles. The general election campaign did not really gear up until Labor Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the candidates and their surrogates have been going full-tilt, firing charges and counter charges like it was the final sprint of October. They've been leveling the kind of charges that, in previous years, would have been held back until the last few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In keeping with the summer theme, it's fitting that the campaigns are doing a lot of cherry-picking. They find a few facts to support their attacks and pound away. (The McCain theme: Obama is a high-tax, big-government Democrat. The Obama theme: McCain is a carbon-copy of President Bush and a puppet of Big Oil.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grain of truth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cherry-picking explains why we've rated so many claims Barely True. There's a grain of truth behind many of their claims, but they ignore contradictory facts and distort the overall truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few examples:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Obama's claim that McCain offers &quot;billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies, but almost nothing for families like yours.&quot; This one misleads about who would benefit from McCain's plan to reduce corporate taxes. It would lower taxes on all corporations, not just for those perennial Democratic villains, oil and drug companies. And the ad is wrong that McCain's plan offers nothing for middle-class families. McCain proposes doubling tax exemptions for dependents (usually children), a significant help for many families. We gave this one a Barely True.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Obama's allegation that McCain worries about nuclear waste in Arizona, but not in Nevada. We found the Obama campaign used some creative editing to make its point, relying on a snippet of a McCain comment that he would not want the waste trucked through Phoenix. The ad conveniently left out the rest of his comment, that &quot;I think it can be made safe.&quot; This ad also earned a Barely True.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- McCain's charge that Obama &quot;promises more taxes on small business, seniors, your life savings, your family.&quot; This one, like several other McCain ads, is based on Obama's plan to roll back the Bush tax cuts on the upper-income brackets. So yes, it's accurate if you earn more than $200,000 per year. But the McCain&nbsp;ad is misleading because most people would not have higher taxes under Obama's plan. Another Barely True.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- McCain's claim that Obama plans &quot;a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year.&quot; That's based on the same flawed logic as the above item and was so wrong we gave it a False.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other trends of summer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another trend we've noticed is how chain e-mails have been evolving. They often seem like organisms that adapt to survive in a harsh environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PolitiFact and other news organizations have discredited many of the e-mails. No, Obama is not a Muslim, he didn't take the oath of office on a Koran and he does not want the national anthem to be I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (a joke from a satirical column that some Obama opponents have passed on as real).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A growing number of the e-mails now include a line that says, &quot;I checked this out on Snopes and it's true,&quot; referring to the Web site that determines whether urban legends are accurate. That line is like a defense mechanism intended to reassure a skeptical reader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most of the e-mails that include the line are still false. So if you see it, be skeptical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another adaptation: a new chain e-mail that makes false claims that Obama plans to raise the capital gains tax. It's a variant of one we checked last spring that made inaccurate accusations about Obama and Hillary Clinton's tax proposals. In the new version, Clinton has been removed and some new false charges have been added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with most chain e-mails, we have no idea who wrote it, but it's been passed along by many people who haven't bothered to check out the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We received another e-mail that used a different twist to spread misinformation: a bogus column. It purported to be written by New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, claiming that Obama received millions of dollars in suspicious contributions from China, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Dowd fans quickly knew it was a fake because, as one fan wrote, it had &quot;no silly puns, alliteration, movie references, or odd nicknames.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We published a story about the bogus column and interviewed one man who was spreading it, but it continues to circulate widely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also saw how fast a false e-mail can spread - presumably to thousands and possibly millions of people. Just a day or two after Obama visited Afghanistan in July, an e-mail spread with lightning speed alleging that he had &quot;shunned the opportunity to talk to soldiers to thank them for their service.&quot; (We checked it out and found it was False.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We got that e-mail from many PolitiFact readers who asked us to check it out, and it received considerable press coverage elsewhere, which indicates how widely and quickly it spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking ahead to the fall and claims we'll check from the candidates, their surrogates and chain e-mails, we're a little apprehensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they're exaggerating and distorting this much in August, what will October be like?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the modern era, national political conventions offer little suspense and less news. They are weeklong television commercials carefully choreographed to pump up the party faithful. They often provide a momentary surge in opinion polls for the presidential candidate but rarely determine the outcome of the November election. But the Democrats' national convention this week in Denver could be different. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama faces different challenges than the typical candidate. He will make history as the first African-American nominee for a major political party. But the reality is he has to both celebrate that accomplishment and reassure voters skeptical of his ethnic and religious background that his values and core beliefs are similar to theirs. While Obama drew enormous crowds during the primary season, he remains a bit of a mystery to many Americans. He cannot let himself be defined by scurrilous attacks on his patriotism or lies about his religious faith (for the hundredth time, he is a Christian, not a Muslim). If Obama accomplishes nothing else this week, he must leave Denver with more voters clearer about his roots and his background to help inoculate himself from the garbage that is sure to come in the general election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While other candidates have used political conventions to unite various party factions, Obama has a unique goal. He has to bring on board the supporters of another candidate who was on the verge of making history, Hillary Clinton. That won't be easy (assuming she is not the running mate, which had yet to be announced when this page went to press), and former President Clinton has demonstrated repeatedly he cannot control his anger or his language when he defends his administration and his wife. Smart speeches by both Clintons could help mend fences this week. But Obama will have to close the sale, and he cannot win in November without the support of women who were so disappointed after the long primary fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he reintroduces himself to voters and mends fences, Obama also has to convince a country fighting costly wars on two fronts that the main election issue is the economy and how to revive it. He and John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, have taken very different positions in the past over Iraq. But regardless of who wins the election, the challenge will be the same: reducing troop levels in Iraq without jeopardizing the gains in recent months, and refocusing on Afghanistan without creating another quagmire. The economy is a different animal; the candidates would steer the country in sharply different directions. Obama has the more responsible approach in eliminating President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest and providing more relief for the middle class. But the Democrat has to drive home that argument this week in concrete ways voters can envision benefitting their own families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, August has not been the best of months for Obama. He has lost the momentum from his primary victories, even though a depressed economy and a hunger for change should play to his advantage. McCain's sharper attacks have made inroads and the race has tightened. But ultimately, the outcome of the election largely depends on whether more voters can get comfortable with Barack Obama. It is up to him this week to start making that happen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did Clinton get bad news in Florida?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Hillary Clinton's demeanor and mood appeared to sour between the two press conferences she gave following speeches first at Florida Atlantic University and later at the King's Point condo community on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the earlier press conference, held around 2:30 p.m., Clinton spoke forcefully, with a quicker, more energetic cadence. She even blurted out a laugh, as a response to a question. Listen to it here (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/bocapresser.mp3).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During her later press conference close to 5 p.m., her eyes appeared sad and glossy, almost on the verge of tears. She spoke more slowly and plaintively and didn't crack much of a smile. Listen to it here (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/kingspointpresser.mp3).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what happened between the two events? Does she miss being the Democratic star in a state that adores her? Or did she get final word about Sen. Barack Obama's veep pick? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more analysis below. (Or tell Buzz she's imagining things!)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the earlier press conference, Clinton began by saying: &quot;I'm very happy to be back here at FAU and looking forward to the convention next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked whether Obama has enough experience, she answered with a strong: &quot;Absolutely...This election is one of those historic moments. . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about her campaign efforts for Sen. Obama she said: &quot;I'm doing everything I can to campaign for Sen. Obama. . I think it's fair to say I've done more in a relatively short period of time on behalf of my opponent. That's because I know what's at stake in this election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the day, Clinton began her began her press conference with: &quot;I'm very glad I could come down here. See a lot of old friends and make a strong case for for Sen. Obama. I'm happy to take a few questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked if she'd come back to Florida to campaign, Clinton's answer was curt and defensive: &quot;We are doing what the Obama campaign asked us to. I was asked to come here and I came. We have said we will do what we can and what we're asked to do. That's really in their hands as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Out of respect to the candidates and other Floridians affected by this storm, I have determined that moving the deadline is the fair and right thing to do for all of those involved in the political process,&quot; said Secretary Browning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of State will have staff available to assist with filings on Friday, August 22, 2008, however, the Department will be closed on Saturday. All of those who are able to file their reports ahead of the extended deadline are encouraged to go ahead and file their reports on Friday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton in Kings Point</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Hillary Clinton took her message of supporting Sen. Barack Obama's presidency to King's Point, a condo community in Tamarac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, her popularity seemed to overshadow her message of asking supporters to support Obama. When she started to thank the crowd for supporting her (as a way of talking about the values she shares with Obama) the crowd interrupted her with whoops, claps and cries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech is similar to the one she gave in Boca Raton, with less talk of abortion rights and more emphasis on preserving social security, since the crowd is mostly senior citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She ended the speech with some of the talk of uniting that began her last speech:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must do everything we can to elect Sen. Obama,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;We may have started on two separate paths, but we are on one journey now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, Clinton appeared casual and comfortable in a crowd of adoring fans. For example, when the lights briefly blinked out in the middle of her speech she said: &quot;That was just a sign from on high.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you care about protecting a women's right to choose and preventing the Supreme Court from becoming even more of a tool for right wing ideology, then Barack Obama is your candidate and must be our president,&quot; Clinton said to one of several roaring standing ovation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton looked and sounded comfortable and even cracked a few self-deprecating jokes during her speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is clear to me that we have our work cut out for us. Maybe it's because I've been involved in presidential politics a long time. To be specific, say 40 years. At this point someone is supposed to say, I don't believe it, clearly that person was not cued right,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's too many homes problem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, sounding not exactly like a man of the people, said yesterday he didn't know how many homes he has. The Barack Obama is jumping on it:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The campaign will spend the day surveying Floridians by phone to ask this question: &quot;Yesterday, John McCain couldn't remember how many homes he owns because he has so many. The Obama campaign is trying to find Floridians who, like McCain, have lost track of the number of homes they own. Do you know how many homes you own?&quot; The campaign will announce the results of the search late this afternoon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FL Team Obama = Team Tom Gallagher?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk to the John McCain FL campaign team about the massive ground operation underway to put Florida's 27 electoral votes in Barack Obama's column and you'll likely hear two words: Tom Gallagher. Remember all the hype about Gallagher's massive grass roots operation in the months before his drubbing in 06 gubernatorial primary?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, there's a major difference. Obama actually has a ton on passionate supporters in Florida; Gallagher didn't. Still, the McCain yard signs are popping up all over the place, and we're seeing a lot more activity in Florida recently. Don't underestimate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend is another &quot;Super Saturday&quot; where volunteers are making an extra big push on phone calls and door knocks. From a campaign e-mail: &quot;As a part of Super Saturday we will also be offering incentive-based prizes/packages. Prizes will be awarded to the top statewide volunteer and on a regional and local office basis. The volunteer who makes the most phone calls will join the official group greeting John McCain when he is next in Florida. If this volunteer is a part of a team, then the entire team will receive VIP tickets for that particular John McCain event.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Mike Haridopolos has crisscrossed Florida this summer, warning voters of the evils of a proposed tax swap that could be on the Nov. 4 ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Republican lawmaker from Indialantic, who hopes to become Senate president in 2010, Amendment 5 is a hidden tax increase. That goes against the mantra he has preached during eight years in the Legislature: Government must shrink, not grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what Haridopolos - the most visible opponent of Amendment 5 - doesn't mention on the road is that he is a longtime government employee, who in February got a big promotion to lecturer and internship coordinator at the University of Florida's Bob Graham Center for Public Service. He is paid $75,000 a year. (story here (http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/state/article777981.ece))</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvey F. Waite, RIP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UPDATE: See details on flowers and funeral arrangements below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buzz is saddened to learn of the passing today of Harvey F. Waite, husband of U.S. Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite, R-Brooksville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Waite, 68, had been battling pancreatic cancer for several months. He died at home, surrounded by family. A former New York State trooper, he and the congresswoman were married for 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The funeral will be held at St. Anthony's Church in Brooksville, where Mr. Waite was an usher, but the details are pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the release from Rep. Brown-Waite's office:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Sadly, the office of Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite announces that the Congresswoman's husband of thirty years, Harvey Waite, passed away today following a bout with pancreatic cancer. At the time of his passing Harvey was surrounded by his loved ones at their home in Brooksville, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvey was born in Bayshore on Long Island, New York on January 2, 1940. He served in the United States Army from 1958 to 1961, doing part of his tour stationed overseas in Japan. Returning to New York after his military service, Harvey joined the New York State Police, where he enjoyed a long and distinguished career as a State Trooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following his retirement from the State, Harvey and Ginny moved to Florida, eventually settling in Hernando County in 1995. Active in many local organizations, Harvey was particularly proud of his service to St. Anthony's Catholic Church, his membership in the Nature Coast British Car Club, and the 10-13 Club of Hernando County. Prior to his cancer diagnosis, Harvey also worked as an Investigator in the Public Defenders Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an usher at St. Anthony's Church, Harvey was able to continue his service to God. A lifelong Catholic, Harvey's funeral service will be held at St. Anthony's. Harvey was also an active member of the Nature Coast British Car Club. He and Ginny would show their red 1959 MGA at Club meetings, and Harvey would often be seen tooling around town with the top down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Always described as the handsomest man on the block wherever he lived, Harvey was a friend to everyone he met and always had a kind word and a quick smile. Known for being handy with his tools, when Harvey reaches the gates of Heaven, St. Peter will probably say, &quot;Welcome Harve ... it is good to finally have someone who can fix the Gates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvey is survived by his loving spouse, Virginia &quot;Ginny&quot; Brown-Waite, sister Barbara Webber of North Carolina, and brother Wayne Waite of New York. He is also survived by their three children Danene Mitchell and her husband Joe, Lorie Busiere and her husband Randy, and Jeannine O'Neill, as well as their four grandchildren Shawn Solomon, Justin Busiere, Christopher Busiere and Autumn Mitchell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UPDATE: Here are the details on funeral arrangements:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist would tap $600-million in reserves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To keep the state budget in the black, Gov. Charlie Crist estimated Tuesday that he expects to use about half of the authority he has to tap two health care funds. The amount of money is slightly more than $600-million, he told reporters. Crist also said it was &quot;not unlikely&quot; that the 4-percent &quot;holdback&quot; on state agencies' budgets would be made permanent and that he opposes a special session to make changes to the budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Legislature gave Crist the authority to dip into the Lawton Chiles endowment fund and the budget stabilization fund, but the BSF withdrawals must be repaid over five years and the withdrawals require approval of the 14-member Legislative Budget Commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama to VFW: My judgment was better</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Barack Obama's prepared remarks to the VFW in Orlando today: &quot; If we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponent's patriotism to win an election, then the American people will lose. The times are too serious for this kind of politics. The calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great. So let me begin by offering my judgment about what we've done, where we are, and where we need to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Six years ago, I stood up at a time when it was politically difficult to oppose going to war in Iraq, and argued that our first priority had to be finishing the fight against Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Senator McCain was already turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, and that - as despicable as Saddam Hussein was - posed no imminent threat to the American people. Two of the biggest beneficiaries of that decision were al Qaeda's leadership, which no longer faced the pressure of America's focused attention; and Iran, which has advanced its nuclear program, continued its support for terror, and increased its influence in Iraq and the region. &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Crying wolf' over Fay?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Tropical Storm Fay's reality falling far short of the media hype, state officials face the inevitable questions about whether they &quot;cried wolf&quot; and needlessly frightened Floridians. &quot;It's important for us to take it seriously. It's important for us to be prepared,&quot; Gov. Charlie Crist said Tuesday, citing deaths in the Caribbean from the storm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Associated Press reporter Bill Kaczor repeatedly posed the &quot;crying wolf&quot; question but Craig Fugate, the state's veteran emergency operations chief, wasn't biting. &quot;Give me a specific example of anything we've said that hasn't been in the forecast,&quot; Fugate said, before reviewing the specific steps state officials took over the weekend based on the weather forecast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When a storm hits, and nobody loses their home, and there's no damage, that's a good storm,&quot; Fugate said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;crying wolf&quot; question always comes up, and the fear is that the next time hurricane watches are posted, people will remember feckless Fay and ignore them at their peril.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do as the governor says, not as the media does,&quot; Fugate said when asked if it's wise for TV reporters to be reporting live out in the storm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Note to readers: A collection of items from our Editorial Blog, with excerpts from comments from readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget about speculation that Florida Gov. Charlie Crist will be the Republican vice presidential nominee. It isn't going to happen, apparently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consensus, among pundits quoted in the media, seems to be that John McCain has three people on his &quot;short list&quot; - Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a former Democratic vice presidential nominee who now describes himself as an &quot;Independent/Democrat.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama may be on the verge of selecting Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine. If not, he's leaning toward Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana or Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware. Hillary Clinton also may be in the mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denis says: Lieberman would seem like a no-brainer. Pick a middle-of-the-road Democrat to garner support from the moderates and broaden his base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I disagree. McCain already has his moderate bona-fides, and they don't win elections. You win elections by appealing to your base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this case, McCain can go a long way toward healing the rift he has created with conservatives by picking Romney as his veep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney may bring those disaffected conservatives who might just stay home in November back to the fold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He isn't going to change any minds among Obama supporters, and can only sit and watch the drama among Hillary's robots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed says: First, I am totally surprised that both candidates are considering a person with very little or no name recognition, or little political popularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This race has already proved to be one of the toughest and closest races of our history, and it is also one that most people are not that thrilled with either candidate, myself included.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of voters have not made up their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is vital that the candidates pick a vice presidential nominee who has political popularity and has some contrast and diversity to add to this race, some positive aspect that the presidential candidate is not able to bring to the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, I believe that both candidates have made a terrible mistake by not announcing their vice presidential choices long before now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting your VP out there stumping for you and swaying those voters to your side is not only helpful but, in this election, I believe will be the determining factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OLYMPICS SLEIGHT OF HAND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better not bank on everything you see from the Olympics - or hear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First came news that the Beijing bash to open the games used computer-generated fireworks for those of us at home, along with previously recorded footage passed off as live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spectacle became unforgettable for the wrong reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came the story of the Chinese government's replacement of a 7-year-old singer with a 9-year-old deemed better looking. It kept the 7-year-old's voice, of course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did the Chinese government go overboard?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morgan Orlins says: Does this surprise anyone? Not me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the opening ceremonies were on TV, the network anchors oohed and aahed at the fabulous spectacle. I saw something else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I saw enormous numbers of people flawlessly doing what they were ordered to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I didn't see individuals; I saw one large, Communist &quot;organism&quot; at work sending a none-too-subtle message to the rest of the world: We have arrived and we will bury you!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I see a spectacle of this sort, whether it was the opening ceremonies of the Moscow games - which we boycotted - or Adolf Hitler's Berlin games, you can't help but wonder how many were killed to make it happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TIRED OF ELECTION TRIVIA?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time magazine is tired of the polls, the race card and Paris Hilton being inserted in the election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, that's not all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How about fewer advertisements and more real debates?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain had the right idea when he proposed a series of long-form discussions with Barack Obama, without much moderation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Dehner says: How about wondering how anyone can be undecided between these two candidates?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as I'm concerned, the only thing that matters is their records and positions before they began campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everything said and done during the campaign should be seen as mere theatrics and ingested with several grains of salt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The longer the campaign goes on, the more likely the feeble-minded among us will be swayed by campaign commercials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Carr says: Perhaps we accentuate the negatives of our electoral process far too often.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a historic election in our country's history with two contrasting candidates. Other local and state issues of import are on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are good research sources available to help the voter make an informed decision, many of these resources are provided locally by the Times Union - both in traditional print and on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The responsibility rests with the individual in the exercise of the privilege we enjoy of participation on the process. Perhaps we should pause and think of how lucky we are to have a voice in our government - remembering that there are many people in the world who don't have a voice and live in true hopelessness and despair. Getting &quot;tired&quot; of the process ought not be an option for Americans.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;It misrepresents citations on specific issues as a blanket indictment of John McCain.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe you've noticed them in some of Sen. Barack Obama's recent television ads, the small print footnotes at the bottom of the screen as the narrator attacks Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They cite newspaper articles, editorials, think tank reports and congressional votes. The print is so small and flashes so quickly, you'd have to freeze the frame to really read them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the message behind these barely noticeably source citations is important. They are intended to add credibility and weight to the accusations being made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Obama's case, the source citations are intended to back up the accusations, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert in political communication from the University of Pennsylvania. But they also help Obama &quot;refute the charge that he's an empty suit full of empty rhetoric.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a tacit refutation that he's speaking in platitudes,&quot; Jamieson said. &quot;It's a very clever rhetorical strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But beware, she said, citations don't always equal legitimate evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes cited articles address a topic but don't fully back up the accusation being made. Or the source cited may have an ideological or political bent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, the citations themselves require scrutiny. And political operatives are betting voters won't give them any.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If one voter out of 10,000 does that, I'd be surprised,&quot; said Allan J. Lichtman, professor of history at American University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how much stock should you place in the source citations? We took a look at several Obama TV ads and found that while some of the sources provided accurate documentation to back up the claims against McCain, others were far from airtight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent Obama TV ad called &quot;Original,&quot; the announcer says of McCain: &quot;He's for billions in new oil company giveaways while gas prices soar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the bottom, there's a footnoted source: &quot;Center for American Progress Action Fund, 3/27/08.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This refers to a report that analyzed how McCain's proposal to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent would reduce taxes for the top four oil companies by nearly $4-billion. PolitiFact looked at this claim when the ad ran, and concluded that it cherry-picked the facts to offer a misleading impression. All companies would get the tax cuts, so the claim wrongly implies that McCain is proposing a special tax cut for oil companies. He is not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's also important to note who is behind the report. The Center for American Progress Action Fund is a think tank headed by former Clinton chief of staff John D. Podesta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's almost like citing yourself,&quot; said Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of The Rothenberg Political Report, a nonpartisan political newsletter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rothenberg believes the citations - which have become more and more commonplace - arose because voters had become cynical about accusations in political ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now it's a different story,&quot; Rothenberg said. &quot;Now it's 'how reliable and credible is the reference?' There are ways to manipulate that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, if you cite the New York Times, do you need to note if it was a news story, an editorial, an opinion column from one writer, or even a guest opinion piece?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Obama's&nbsp;ad &quot;Original,&quot; the announcer says: &quot;John McCain supports Bush's tax cuts for millionaires.&quot; One of the sources cited in small print is &quot;Ari Melber, Politico 7/22/08.&quot; David Mark, a senior editor at Politico, said that while Melber's story was &quot;certainly a reported article,&quot; it was an opinion piece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamieson and others believe viewers might give different weight to an article if they knew it was written as opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama&nbsp;ad called &quot;Low Road&quot; begins with an image of McCain and the announcer stating, &quot;He's practicing the politics of the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad then takes a page from movie trailers that steal snippets from movie reviews as part of their advertising campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain,&quot; the announcer states. &quot;His attacks on Obama ... 'Not True' (MSNBC 7/28/08) ... 'False' (FactCheck.org 7/28/08) ... 'Baloney' (USA Today Editorial 7/29/08) ... 'the low road' (New York Times Editorial) 7/30/08 ... 'baseless' (Time 7/30/08).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the quotations - from MSNBC, FactCheck.org and Time - refer to McCain's criticism of Obama for his last-minute decision to cancel a visit with wounded troops in Germany during a recent political tour of Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He made time to go to the gym, but canceled a visit with wounded troops,&quot; an announcer in a McCain&nbsp;ad states. &quot;Seems the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;baloney&quot; quote in a USA Today editorial relates to a McCain campaign ad that suggests Obama is to blame for the high price of gas. The &quot;low road&quot; quote came from the headline on a New York Times editorial that admonished McCain for a series of campaign ads it said weren't based in fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the above citations do accurately reflect what those sources said. But the ad takes media evaluations of specific McCain claims and presents them as a more blanket indictment of McCain's&nbsp;ad campaign. As presented, the ad essentially states, for example, that &quot;His (McCain's) attacks on Obama (are) false,&quot; according to FactCheck.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not true. Many of McCain's attacks on Obama are accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamieson, who works at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communication, which produces FactCheck.org, said she thought the quote was a distortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw that and said, 'FactCheck should fact-check that,'&quot; Jamieson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be fair, there are some citations in the Obama ads that do accurately reflect the sources cited, and do back up some of the accusations in the ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, one ad correctly cites a congressional vote in November 2005 in which McCain voted, in the majority, against a bill to impose a temporary windfall profit tax on crude oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, Lichtman concludes that attack ads that cite sources should not be accepted as giving accusations any greater authority or factual accuracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's a good tactic,&quot; Lichtman said. &quot;But that's what it is, a tactic. For us skeptics, it doesn't mean much. Anyone who gets their facts from political ads gets what they deserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's attacks on Obama are &quot;not true,'' &quot;false,'' &quot;baloney,'' according to media outlets, an Obama campaign ad says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The individual citations are correct, but the ad presents them altogether as a broad critique of McCain's&nbsp;ad campaign.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a quote from Barack Obama in the July 31 article (&quot;McCain&nbsp;ad chides Obama's celebrity&quot;): &quot;(John McCain) doesn't seem to have anything to say very positive about himself. He seems to only be talking about me.&quot; I have wondered about this myself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of Sen. McCain's ads, town hall meetings and press conferences are Obama, Obama, Obama. Sen. McCain is the one with all the &quot;experience&quot; -- 30 years in Congress and a long military background. Why does he not want to discuss any of this? I decided to research this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On veterans affairs, Sen. McCain voted against the Webb amendment calling for adequate troop rest between deployments. He voted against a plan to draw down troop levels in Iraq. He voted against an amendment to provide $20 million to the Department of Veterans Affairs for health-care facilities. He voted against increasing veterans' medical services with $1.5 billion to be paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, a veteran, has gone out of his way to vote against the needs of those serving in our military. His voting record on issues related to women is just as abysmal. So now we know why he refuses to talk about himself and has to focus on Obama, Obama, Obama.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">537 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After more than two decades of political consensus on offshore oil exploration, $4 gas and two pandering presidential candidates have put Florida's coast in imminent danger. Congress may take up a plan as early as next month that would put rigs as close as 50 miles from shore, and every Florida representative needs to stand up and be counted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is more drilling really the solution?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though a comprehensive energy policy might reasonably include more domestic production, there is nothing comprehensive about the deal now being offered by the U.S. Senate's so-called Gang of 10. The plan is being sold as a way to break the partisan gridlock, but it is mostly a grab-bag of tax breaks. While it does establish some conservation goals and push new technologies for vehicles, it leaves the more substantive work to a newly appointed energy commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Florida, the plan would renege on a congressional deal made just 20 months ago. That compromise added some 8.3-million acres off the state's Gulf Coast to the oil industry's inventory in return for a coastal buffer zone of between 125 and 234 miles. The deal was supposed to last until 2022.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not much has changed since that 2006 vote, certainly not the potential danger to the state's $65-billion tourist industry or the nation's ongoing need for alternatives to foreign oil. But the price of gas has certainly changed. In turn, presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain and presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama both reversed course on drilling. They were against it before they were for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those reversals have set the stage for a White House raid on oil-drilling regulation. President Bush lifted the executive ban signed by his father. The Interior Department has moved to prepare plans for drilling off the entire U.S. coast. The Defense Department has suddenly expressed less concern about drilling in the same gulf waters it uses for air and sea operational training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next step, which could happen after Labor Day, would be for Congress to betray Florida. That's the effect of the deal being offered by the Gang of 10, and no member of the Florida delegation should be allowed to pretend otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stated rationale for this sellout is that Congress must deal with the emergency of skyrocketing gas prices, but everyone knows that's fiction. A report last year by Bush's own Energy Department said new drilling &quot;would not have a significant impact&quot; on prices until at least 2030. In the past eight years, in fact, oil drilling permits on public lands have increased nearly fivefold while gas prices have only continued to increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has become so fixated on domestic drilling that he is starting sounding like an Exxon executive: &quot;We have to drill here and we have to drill now and we have to drill immediately.'' He is even airing a commercial that features footage of an offshore oil rig silhouetted against the setting sun, accompanied by acoustic guitar music, as though it was at one with nature. Is that really a winning image? As for Obama, his &quot;yes, we can'' mantra now applies to offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida officials had better stand at attention here. Without some congressional backbone, this state is about to get drilled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama campaign manager David Plouffe held a brief conference call with Florida volunteers tonight, noting that the campaign challenged them to make 50,000 phone calls in 48 hours and they are now at &quot;more than 125,000 calls and counting, which how this campaign is going to be won - people like you in the communities talking to your neighbors and colleagues about Barack Obama,'' he said. &quot;At the end of the day we believe this election in Florida and nationally will be won one door knock, one call at a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the last 48 hrs you've showed what this campaign is going to be capable of in the fall,'' said Plouffe, noting the demographic shifts and voter registration trends make Florida a strong opportunity for Obama</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Buzz is that Gov.

The Florida Judicial Nominating Commission nominated eight men, only two of which were Hispanic. No women, no African-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about the lack of diversity Thursday afternoon, Crist said that: &quot;I've got several concerns about it, so I'm looking at what my options are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Crist has the authority to ask the Judicial Nominating Commission to go back and reconsider. He wouldn't be the first.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot stand in the way of economic improvement,&quot; Crist said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist called it &quot;unbelievable&quot; that over the past 10 years, the state had only spent $28 billion on these new projects. &quot;That's not tolerable. That will not be tolerated.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UPDATE: Gov. Charlie Crist, in a press avail in Tallahassee, just told reporters: &quot;I was disappointed, but not dismayed. It will be appealed.&quot; He said what matters is the last court decision, &quot;not the first.&quot; He added, &quot;I hope it stays on the ballot. Most important to me is that the people have the opportunity to make the call. It's their Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the argument that the ballot title and summary are misleading, Crist said: &quot;A headline is supposed to give you an idea about what's in the body of the story. It was a headline. It didn't seem inaccurate to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Tallahassee circuit court judge has deemed the wording of Amendment 5 misleading, stripping it from the November ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court finds that the ballot title and summary provided in the proposition for Amendment 5 fail to fairly inform the voter, in clear and unambiguous language of the chief purposes of the amendment and the language of the title and summary, as written, is misleading in the forgoing respects,&quot; Judge John C. Cooper wrote. (Download the ruling as a PDF here: http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/image_orders.pdf.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper foreshadowed his decision with tough questions (http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/state/article770313.ece) yesterday for lawyers for John McKay's Vote Yes on 5 committee and the Taxation and Budget Reform Commission, which placed the amendment on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper mainly faulted a provision that states that the lost funding for schools would be replaced with an &quot;equivalent hold harmless amount.&quot; But funding was only guaranteed for one year, after which the Legislature would have to come up with new revenue sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state is certain to appeal, and the case will likely go directly to the Florida Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was very pleased with the way the arguments went yesterday and felt Judge Cooper had a firm understanding of the issues. Unfortunately for them, opposing counsel's arguments fell short,&quot; said the Coalition's attorney Barry Richard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida voters want property tax relief - not a tax increase. Voting for Amendment 5 would be like buying a new shirt on sale for $20 and then being told you owe $50 more for the bag to take it home in&quot; said the coalition spokeswoman Jennifer Green.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick McAllister of the Florida Retail Federation &quot;Voters need clear information, and this amendment fell short. It was called a tax swap, but it was never clear what we were swapping for. Amendment 5 would have exposed Florida 's schools to budget cuts by removing a stable property tax without a full explanation of how it would be replaced. It would have been left up to future Legislatures to deal with the unknown consequences and tax increases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaction from the Florida Association of Realtors, which supported the amendment:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeownership is a fundamental right, and Floridians deserve a say on how their property is taxed,&quot; said FAR President Chuck Bonfiglio. &quot;We are shocked that the court decided to deny property owners' the ability to dramatically lower their property tax rates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If passed, Amendment 5 will cut property taxes by 25 percent, and in some counties up to 40 percent. The Legislature is required to make up those dollars by a variety of ways, including but not limited to a one cent increase in the state sales tax, reviewing existing sales tax exemptions, and overall budget cuts. Schools will still be funded, and held harmless under Amendment 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association will continue to monitor the appeals process as the amendment is expected to go to the District Court of Appeals and the Florida Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaction from Sen. Mike Haridopolos, Amendment 5 opponent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tallahassee, FL - Senator Mike Haridopolos, leading opponent of Amendment 5 and advocate for Florida's future fiscal sustainability, released the following statement today in response to Leon County Circuit Judge John C. Cooper's ruling to remove the tax-swap proposal from the November ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ruling is a reflection of what so many voters have been telling us as we have been traveling the state to discuss the ramifications of Amendment 5. The amendment's title and its proponents' explanations do not match its true nature and impact on the state's taxpayers and budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This amendment is a bad deal for Florida and a bait and switch proposal of the worst kind. Amendment 5 is clearly not a tax cut and our state's education system, among others, would likely be harmed if this is embedded into our state's Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though we consider today's ruling a victory for the voters and taxpayers of Florida, we will continue to fight against the amendment until all appeals are exhausted and we are certain that Florida's hardworking families are free from this crippling tax increase.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timing can mean a lot in life, particularly in politics. Take District 56. At the start of the week, it looked as if state Rep. Trey Traviesa was cruising to re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when he announced Tuesday that he was dropping out, it left a void for Republicans. If Traviesa had done this before June 21, there would have been time for other registered Republicans to enter the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he announced after the June 21 qualifying deadline, though, state law says the task of replacing Traviesa on the general election ballot falls to an obscure committee of Republicans. So, instead of 40,000 registered Republicans deciding among an open field, three unelected people unknown to the general public will pick the Republican nominee in a heavily conservative district.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge seems skeptical of Amendment 5</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UPDATE 2:53 p.m.: Cooper said he intends to issue an opinion later today or in the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Tallahassee circuit judge seems sympathetic to the argument that the Amendment 5 proposal is misleading, possibly signaling trouble for the &quot;tax swap&quot; to remain on the November ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the opening moments of a hearing now under way, Judge John C. Cooper has agreed that the ballot summary implies that the loss of property taxes for schools would be wholly replaced -- or &quot;held harmless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You take a quarter from over here and you replace it from a quarter over here,&quot; Cooper said, illustrating the concept of an even revenue trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But lawyers defending the measure countered that the summary (http://election.dos.state.fl.us/initiatives/initdetail.asp?account=12&amp;seqnum=6) refers to only the first year of implementation, 2010-2011, and thereafter the Legislature would have to come up with a plan. The proposal would eliminate at least $9-billion in school funding, to be replaced with other revenue sources including a higher sales tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers said it should be left to the public to decide. Replied Cooper: &quot;In the court of public opinion, doesn't the public ultimately have to be told what it's being asked to decide?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a listing of what is in the amendment,&quot; Mark Herron, a lawyer for the defendants, said of the summary. &quot;Does it specifically list every nuance and every detail? I would agree with everyone in the courtroom that it doesn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper also honed in on a provision that would limit annual nonhomestead property assessments to 5 percent, down from the 10 percent adopted under Amendment 1 in January. Voters, he said, could think that had to do with the school property taxes at the heart of Amendment 5 and the ballot summary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if I'm the average voter,&quot; Cooper said, &quot;but I had to read two or three hours to figure out what that meant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite his probing questions, Cooper has also noted that backers of the plan could seek a court order forcing the Legislature to fully replace the money. That, of course, raises a host of other questions about separation of power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida Democratic Party today called on the FBI to investigate the allegations that Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Sarasota, violated campaign finance law by pressuring employees to donate to his campaign and allowing his campaign to reimburse those who did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the past several weeks, the Sarasota Herald Tribune and other media outlets have uncovered very serious allegations of fraud and violations of election laws by Congressman Vern Buchanan. Based on the seriousness of the charges being made, it is only appropriate that the FBI and other authorities begin investigating these allegations,&quot; FDP spokesman Eric Jotkoff said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Herald Tribune recently reported that two former executives at Buchanan's car dealerships contend they were said they were pressured to donate to Buchanan's 2006 congressional campaign and were offered cash and gifts in return. Buchanan's lawyer says they're lying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP said the Democrats' attack was simply timed to coincide with this week's visits by Gov. Charlie Crist and Florida GOP Chairman Jim Greer on Buchanan's behalf. RPOF spokeswoman Erin VanSickle also mentioned Jennings' tax troubles: Her campaign failed to pay tens of thousands of dollars in payroll taxes during her 2004 and 2006 races for Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now, voters in Florida District 13 must be use to political hijinks. Buchanan narrowly defeated Democrat Christine Jennings in that disputed election in 2006. (She's staging a rematch this year). And this was the seat once held by Republican Katherine Harris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jennings and the Democrats are obviously trying to deflect attention from the fact,&quot; VanSickle said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heiress and professional celebrity Paris Hilton has a new video out - one we can all watch. This one is in response to a campaign ad from Republican presidential candidate John McCain that parodied Democratic candidate Barack Obama as a celebrity on par with Britney Spears and Hilton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The narrator of the McCain&nbsp;ad says of Obama, &quot;He's the biggest celebrity in the world,&quot; then asks, &quot;But is he ready to lead?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Hilton's video, produced by funnyordie.com, the narrator begins, &quot;He's the oldest celebrity in the world. Like super old. Old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket.&quot; The narrator then turns the tables on McCain: &quot;But is he ready to lead?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Hilton appears, sporting a swimsuit and sprawled in a lounge chair. &quot;Hey, America, I'm Paris Hilton and I'm a celebrity too. Only I'm not from the olden days, and I'm not promising change like that other guy. I'm just hot. But then that wrinkly, white-haired guy used me in his campaign ad, which I guess means I'm running for president.&quot; Then she sums up her energy policy in about 30 seconds:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight, while creating tax incentives to get Detroit making hybrid and electric cars. That way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in, which will then create new jobs and energy independence. Energy crisis solved!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sounds pragmatic, but leasing, exploring and drilling will take far longer than passing a tax incentive for hybrids, which we already have. Still, she offers a better approach than the &quot;drill everywhere&quot; effort in Congress, which would do little to reduce prices or the nation's dependence on foreign oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hilton's &quot;ad&quot; has had 6.6 million views on funnyordie.com alone as of Tuesday. She reminds us that anyone can make brief statements that sound good.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infuriated by Sen. John McCain's anti-Obama&nbsp;ad in which he compared the presumptive Democratic nominee to celebrities Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, the two tabloid mainstays fought back with an eviscerating anti-McCain spot of their own. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Spears and Hilton said they had planned to remain on the sidelines during the 2008 presidential campaign, Sen. McCain's negative ad &quot;left us no choice,&quot; they said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't mind John McCain going after us if he sticks to the facts,&quot; Spears said at a New York news conference. &quot;But we are sick of the distortions about our record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hilton said that the McCain&nbsp;ad appeared to link herself and Spears to Sen. Obama, leading the casual viewer to conclude that the three of them had &quot;the same energy policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing could be further from the truth,&quot; Spears said. &quot;Both of us strongly favor offshore drilling to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, both women later clarified their comments, saying they would need to study Obama's policy more closely, as he seems to be moving closer toward their views on that issue, though they still have substantive differences on the strategic oil reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hilton said she was also &quot;offended&quot; by the implication that she and Spears favor a tax on electricity: &quot;We have both been very clear on that issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their anti-McCain spot, the two starlets fight fire with fire, comparing Sen. McCain to the Joker from the smash-hit film The Dark Knight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's perfectly fair,&quot; Spears said of the ad. &quot;They both have pasty white faces and totally creepy smiles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, as the Olympics get under way, Chinese officials confiscated the poles of the pole vaulting team to prevent athletes from going over the wall.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first question I asked John McCain and then Barack Obama was: How do you feel about the tone and direction of the campaign so far?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No surprise. Both men pronounced themselves thoroughly frustrated by the personal bitterness and negativism they have seen in the two months since they learned they would be running against each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very sorry about it,&quot; Sen. McCain said in an interview at his Arlington, Va., headquarters. &quot;I think we could have avoided at least some of this if we had agreed to do the town hall meetings&quot; together, as he had suggested, during the summer months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Obama, in a phone interview from Elkhart, Ind., argued that &quot;the classic tit-for-tat campaigning&quot; of recent weeks &quot;is part of the politics of the past that we have to move beyond.&quot; Ironically, having turned down Sen. McCain's proposal for weekly joint town halls, Sen. Obama argued that the formal debates, starting in late September, may refocus the campaign on real issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back on June 4, Sen. McCain proposed 10 joint town halls before screened audiences of uncommitted independent voters across the country. Sen. Obama countered by offering two such sessions this summer, one on Independence Day and one in August, and the idea died. Earlier this week, Sen. Obama said he would participate only in the three debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, the first scheduled for Sept. 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the idea of joint town meetings was scrapped, the campaign has featured tough and often negative ads and speeches. They culminated last week with an exchange in which Sen. Obama said that Sen. McCain and his supporters were calling attention to the Democrat's unusual name and the fact that &quot;he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign in turn accused Sen. Obama of playing &quot;the race card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interviews, both candidates expressed indignation at what was being said of them. &quot;I'm not going to be smeared,&quot; Sen. McCain declared. &quot;I went through that once and I'm not going to do it again. ... If anybody says I'm a racist, ... I'm not going to stand for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Obama insisted that he had never made such an accusation. And he condemned Sen. McCain for suggesting that &quot;I would rather lose a war to win a political campaign. That is patently offensive. When his campaign ran an ad suggesting that I had refused to visit wounded troops because I couldn't have TV cameras with me, reporters immediately said that was patently false. ... I'm not going to sit back and let my record be distorted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I asked Sen. Obama how he thought the campaign could be returned to the issues, he said he hoped that the two conventions would &quot;offer each party a chance to showcase its best ideas&quot; and then the three scheduled presidential debates &quot;will allow people to see Sen. McCain and myself interact in a way that keeps people more honest because you're standing there face to face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Obama continued, &quot;My general point is that both the conventions and the debates will offer formats for Sen. McCain and myself to make our best case to the American people at a time when the American people will be paying attention. And ultimately, the best corrective to overly negative campaigns are the American people, who are not interested in a lot of bickering, but are interested in who's got the best answers for the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think everybody would agree to that last point.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain to return donations from Fla bundler</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From AP: John McCain's campaign said Thursday it is returning $50,000 in contributions solicited by a foreign citizen. The move follows the disclosure that the money was being raised by a Jordanian man who is a business partner of prominent Florida Republican Harry Sargeant III, who has collected hundreds of thousands of dollars for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times reported Thursday that Sargeant allowed a longtime business partner, Mustafa Abu Naba'a, to bring in some $50,000 in donations in March from members of a single extended family in California, the Abdullahs, along with several of their friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abdullahs and other Arab-Americans in California also contributed tens of thousands of dollars to Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republicans Rudolph Giuliani and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, a longtime friend of Sargeant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Times, Abu Naba'a is a dual citizen of Jordan and the Dominican Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is illegal for foreigners to contribute their own money to U.S. political campaigns, and McCain's campaign said Abu Naba'a did not do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said some of the people solicited by Abu Naba'a had no intention of supporting McCain for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rogers said &quot;that just didn't sound right to us&quot; so the money is being returned. He estimated the total at less than $50,000, saying &quot;we think we have a pretty good estimate of how much Abu Naba'a solicited.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain has a new 60-second radio ad, running on Spanish language stations in Florida and other key states, that slams Barack Obama as an enemy to working families. &quot;No doubt, Barack Obama is a popular figure, a celebrity who says the right thing. But will he do the right thing?&quot; it asks. The tax increase on middle class families claim refers to Obama's vote on a nonbinding budget resolution that would have allowed provisions of 2001 and 2003 tax cut packages to expire in 2011.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So here's the question you need to ask yourself, in these tough economic times, are you ready for a president who voted for higher income taxes on working families making $42,000 a year?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moffitt Cancer Center has told Buzz that they're &quot;concerned about the perception&quot; of hiring lobbyists who lobby for both the center and tobacco companies and &quot;moving forward, Moffitt will be reviewing its policies concerning who represents the cancer center with the legislature,&quot; said Michelle Foley, spokeswoman for Moffitt Cancer Center.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate over which presidential candidate is to blame for high gas prices - Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain - will have to take place somewhere other than the local fueling station. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Gas Station TV, which delivers media content to 31 gas stations in Florida and 500 across the country, decided to ban political ads from their television-enhanced pumps, CEO David Leider said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision came the same day Obama's campaign planned to use some of the gas station TVs in Florida to air his latest energy commercial, a spot called &quot;National Priorities&quot; that accuses McCain of opposing alternative energy measures and implies that he is a pawn of the oil industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision from the company, which counts oil companies as a staple advertiser, also comes in a year when high gas prices - and who is to blame for them - has become a top issue in the presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign blamed Gas Station TV for censoring his energy platform and &quot;taking sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are standing with John McCain, because they know he's been in Washington for 26 years and can be counted on to pursue ... the Bush energy policy that's made them billions of dollars,&quot; Obama spokesman Mark Bubriski said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign released an e-mail exchange between an advertising representative and the campaign staff showing that Michigan-based Gas Station TV agreed to run the ad Friday. But a public relations adviser for the company said that was from was an employee of ABC, which along with CBS provides some content to the company. She said Gas Station TV has final approval over all content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gas Station TV is strictly G-rated,&quot; said Elin Nozewski, of Airfoil Public Relations. &quot;News of murders are edited out of the CBS feeds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The e-mail exchange also showed that Sunoco, which owns about half of the stations in Florida with TVs in the pumps, opposed airing the Obama&nbsp;ad. There are no gas stations with televisions in the pumps in Palm Beach, Martin or St. Lucie counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sunoco decided not to accept any political ads because we don't want to appear to be taking sides when our customers pull up to buy their gasoline,&quot; Sunoco spokesman Thomas Golembeski said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPOT WAS TO AIR AT GAS PUMPS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By WILLIAM MARCH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tampa Tribune</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA - It was a neat idea for targeting a political ad: Hit people with a Barack Obama message about gas prices on those new TV screens that are appearing on top of the pumps at gas stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While they're watching their money run out through the hose, they'll hear Obama's message saying John McCain is in the pocket of Big Oil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ads never ran, leading to a controversy between the campaign and the advertising company over why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign blamed the oil industry, saying the company went back on an agreement to run the ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The oil companies shut us down,&quot; campaign spokeswoman Adrianne Marsh charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She later retracted that remark, but Mark Bubriski, communications director for the campaign in Florida, issued a statement saying almost the same thing:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once again, the oil companies and their friends are standing with Senator McCain, the candidate for president who is proposing to offer them a $4 billion tax cut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company, Gas Station TV, denied that, saying it has &quot;made a conscious decision not to run political ads,&quot; and never agreed to run this one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, it was an unusual example of a flub by a campaign that normally runs like a well-oiled machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also an indication that Obama, frustrated at being a punching bag for McCain on energy issues, is eager to hit back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For days, McCain has been calling him &quot;Dr. No-bama&quot; for opposing offshore oil drilling, and making him the butt of jokes, including handing out tire pressure gauges labeled, &quot;Obama's Energy Plan&quot; - a reference to Obama's comments that keeping tires properly inflated saves gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hitting back, Obama made energy the theme of events Tuesday in Ohio and today in Indiana, and has compiled his proposals on energy into a &quot;New Energy for America&quot; section on his Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign also had plans for events at gas stations it hoped would generate nationwide publicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters were to gather at stations and hand out fliers on the energy plan, including City Council member Mary Mulhern at an Amoco station on Fletcher Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Obama&nbsp;ad would play on the TV screens on the pumps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As gas prices soared and dependence on oil exploded, McCain was voting against alternative energy, against higher mileage standards,&quot; the ad says. &quot;Barack Obama - he'll make energy independence an urgent national priority ? break the grip of foreign oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign even called reporters to alert them - but the ads didn't appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Michigan-based company in charge of the gas pump TV screens, Gas Station TV, issued a statement saying it never agreed to run the Obama&nbsp;ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement from CEO David Leider said the company has been approached by several campaigns, but has &quot;made a conscious decision not to run political ads on our network.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At no time did Gas Station TV approve the campaign or receive an 'insertion order,' which is required to purchase ad times,&quot; he said. He contended the company never saw the ad to review or approve it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman said Gas Station TV is owned by a media company, Destination Media, not by oil-industry interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign tells a different story about what happened with the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Wednesday, it sent reporters copies of what it said were e-mails between the campaign's media buyer and GSTV representatives, who said the spot was approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not have an IO [insertion order], but once I have that, and the asset is delivered, I can have on air with an hour or less,&quot; said one e-mail, apparently from a GSTV salesman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Experts No Longer Urging Monthly Breast Self-Exams&quot; (Nation/World, July 31):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am appalled that such a recommendation would be made by medical organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, just four months after my annual exam and six months after an annual mammogram, I was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer after I discovered a lump during my own monthly breast self-exam. Had I waited until my next annual exam, I most likely would not be here today, leaving three young children without a mother. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research cited by the medical groups may only have studied older women, excluding a small percent of breast cancer patients - women under 45. Cancer in younger women is often more aggressive than in women over 70, often resulting in more diagnoses of advanced stages of cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Self-exams are important and often the first indicator that something is wrong.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it may be true that a candidate believes that certain issues may fall under the purview of &quot;states' rights,&quot; you can bet that if John McCain wins the presidency, he would have a concrete opinion of any issue that his special-interest supporters were interested in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened to the &quot;straight talk express&quot;? Then again he also pledged not to run a negative campaign, and today we see an ad that he approved running blatant lies and misrepresentations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this leadership or pandering? It's very disappointing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insulted By Media Bias</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William March reports that Republicans are complaining of unfair media coverage. This is news? March evidently has not been reading The Tampa Tribune, wherein daily pictures of Obama appear consistently much larger and are always placed above those of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that Barack Obama's crash course in foreign affairs experience - by a taxpayer-funded visit to Europe and the Mideast - is some kind of qualifying test is another media concoction to help him get elected. Typically, Obama is featured as focused on major issues while McCain visits an eatery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truly the intelligence of the American people is insulted by the media's bias, which is hardly a pretension any more.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last eight years have made us fearful to speak our minds on sensitive topics lest we be considered unpatriotic. The campaign of Sen. John McCain seems to be feeding off this very sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard to criticize a man running for president when we see photos of him as a prisoner of war. But don't we want the very best for our country, and doesn't that mean that every candidate be scrutinized and questioned to the utmost? The mainstream media and many Americans don't want to be accused of not honoring this man's heroic past. But let us gently and deliberately put that issue aside and ask him all the tough questions we would want asked of our candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am the mother of a son serving in the Army, and I am so very proud of our troops. For the country of Iraq, for who they so courageously fought to achieve freedom to be saying &quot;Thank you, you can leave now&quot; is a great victory in itself. Do we really want to elect a new president who is so affected by past heroism that he must always keep fighting, in this war and in wars to come, no matter what?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's pick the best one, let's question them all equally, let's be brave and not be afraid to speak our minds. Do we really want the next president of our great country that we love to get there on a free pass?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By MARSHA MERCER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Al Gore got it right when he said, &quot;I don't remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gore's summary: &quot;Our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse, gasoline prices are increasing dramatically, and so are electricity rates. Jobs are being outsourced. Home mortgages are in trouble. Banks, automobile companies and other institutions we depend upon are under growing pressure. Distinguished senior business leaders are telling us that this is just the beginning unless we find the courage to make some major changes quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The climate crisis, in particular, is getting a lot worse - much more quickly than predicted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gore isn't running for anything, and he says he's not interested in returning to politics, which is probably good. Not that it's going out on a limb to describe the myriad problems facing the country. Nearly eight in 10 people think the country is on the wrong track, according to the latest AP-Ipsos poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But politicians shy away from saying the country's problems are so complex and interrelated that they demand a big solution, that people will have to change their ways and that time's up for the oil industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gore said all three in his energy speech in Washington July 17, when he challenged Americans to produce 100 percent of our electricity needs from renewable energy and carbon-free sources within 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet. Every bit of that's got to change,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to disagree. President Bush has said we must end our addiction to oil. But when Al Gore says things like that, he inspires some and infuriates others. Some love the fact that he's willing to propose major change while others think that the former senator, vice president and presidential candidate should sit down and shut up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Gore's speech, the two men who are actively seeking the presidency took time out from telling us what's wrong with each other to endorse Gore's idea to pursue wind, solar and biofuels as sources of electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain said if Gore says it's doable, he believes it is. Barack Obama praised Gore's proposal as a strategy that will create millions of new jobs and help the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then it was back to the daily slugfest. What's striking is how little discussion we are having about fixes for the problems we face. It's a presidential election year in which you'd think the contest was to find the candidate with the cleverest ad or the one whose aim is better at lobbing verbal grenades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're hearing little from either campaign about where these men would lead the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, one of the knocks against Gore and his energy speech was that he was consciously emulating JFK's challenge to put a man on the moon. But if 80 percent of people think the country needs a new direction, what's so bad about that?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* She put up billboards calling Martin Luther King Jr. a Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* She handed out buttons calling the Democratic Party &quot;poverty pimps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* And she published a photo of a Ku Klux Klan rally with a caption that read, &quot;Every person in this photograph was a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At age 64, well into her retirement from the Army, Frances Rice is at the center of a contentious campaign on race and politics -- and she has never been happier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of the Sarasota-based National Black Republican Association is a minority within a minority. Not only is she black, she is also a Republican, a member of a party to which fewer than 10 percent of black voters in Florida belong. Her campaigns -- including one meant to foil the nomination of the first black presidential candidate, Barack Obama -- are best known for their shock value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her messages have brought condemnation from Democrats. But they have also sparked a backlash among many Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she was criticized for raising billboards in Southwest Florida saying &quot;Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican,&quot; she challenged anyone to sue her if they thought she was wrong. &quot;Let them come into court with their evidence,&quot; Rice said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When hearing that the chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, Jim Greer, had expressed disappointment in her magazine, The Black Republican, which Greer had secured party money to publish, Rice dismissed it with a wave of her hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magazine featured a picture of Ku Klux Klan members burning a cross, with the caption &quot;Every person in this photograph was a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article titles included &quot;Democrats</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">embrace their child molesters,&quot; and &quot;Top 10 Democratic sex scandals in Congress,&quot; and &quot;Democrats wage war on God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rice shows no intention of backing down. Her personal history of growing up in poverty under segregation is her fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the first time in my life that I have felt I am actually doing something about what the Democrats have done in the past and are doing now to black people,&quot; Rice said. &quot;If the Democrats had left us alone after the Republicans freed us from slavery we wouldn't be having this discussion today. They are keeping blacks in virtual slavery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans question tactics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters call Rice relentless, a black Republican willing to say things white Republicans cannot. Detractors say she is setting back the GOP's black outreach effort with her inflammatory campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously we weren't consulted before she decided to do any of this,&quot; said Tony Cooper, president of the Tampa Black Republican Club. &quot;It's a fruitless debate and it may conjure up more ill will toward the party. We should be spending money on debating the Democrats on the issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Deon Long, president of Florida's Federation of Black Republican Clubs: &quot;We thought those billboards were asinine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rice thinks of herself as an &quot;iron butterfly&quot; positioned to expose the &quot;Democratic Party's racist past&quot; in time to convince blacks to vote for John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the launch of billboard and radio campaigns this summer she says membership to her association has doubled to 2,000. Last week she hosted a booth at the Urban League meeting in Orlando, where McCain and Obama gave speeches. Next month she plans to host the inaugural meeting of the Black Republican Forum in New York, an event she organized, where discussions include race and presidential politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is so politically active that tax lawyers question why the NBRA has nonprofit status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July she launched three radio ads on WLSS, a talk radio station reaching from southern St. Petersburg to Venice, and more are scheduled to run in Charlotte County. One urges listeners to &quot;Look beyond Barack Obama's skin color and soaring rhetoric and see an arrogant, elitist millionaire.&quot; Another refers to Obama's friends as &quot;unrepentant terrorists.&quot; Another begins with the statement &quot;The Democratic Party is a racist party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greer, the state party chairman, said the party is no longer donating to the NBRA. While pictures of himself and Gov. Charlie Crist were on the cover of the magazine, along with favorable articles about them, Greer said he had no knowledge of the other content until after the magazine was published.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mrs. Rice has some very strong views on certain issues,&quot; Greer said. &quot;It showed us that before we donate to anything, regardless of how it appears, the party needs to ensure it takes a look at all the content.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain's campaign staff said they were aware of the NBRA but declined to comment. A photo on the NRBA's Web site shows McCain posing with Rice at the NAACP convention in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dismissing the National Black Republican Association as an inconsequential fringe group would mean ignoring that it was founded by and has received tens of thousands of dollars in funding from the Republican Party. In a tight presidential campaign in Florida, its radio ads, magazine and billboards carry some potential to either erode black support for Obama or backfire against McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Party executive committees in Highlands, Hillsborough, Manatee and Charlotte counties contributed $500 or more each to put up the billboards in their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Jennifer Carroll, R-Fleming Island, the first black female Republican elected to the state Legislature and a supporter of Rice, admitted that calling Democrats racists might not be the best way of getting out the message that the Republican Party is better for blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it certainly gets your attention,&quot; Carroll said. &quot;There's value in that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a local print shop in July, while Rice was proofreading the new issue, she detailed her plans to set up a booth at the NAACP convention in Cincinnati.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formerly a lawyer and a U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, she has a melodic voice suited to delivering both closing arguments and drill commands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I imagine we're going to be the most visited booth at the convention, and there's going to be blood on the floor,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm looking forward to it. I tell you, I am having so much fun. I feel that for the first time in my life I'm actually making a difference in what's happening in the political arena.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new issue of The Black Republican contains a letter to Obama asking him to &quot;apologize for the Democratic Party's racist past,&quot; and an article entitled, &quot;Bill Clinton says Barack Obama must 'kiss my ass' for his support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnover on the board</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, when Republican Party leaders in Palm Beach County learned that nearly twice as many African-Americans in Florida voted for President Bush as did in 2000, they celebrated and began dreaming of possibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wanted to carry that out and see what we could make happen if we initiated a national organization,&quot; said Andre Cadogan, an engineer who chaired the county's black Republican caucus at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Palm Beach County Republican Party donated about $20,000 in seed money to start the National Black Republican Association in 2005, Cadogan said. Rice was a natural choice to lead the group. She and Cadogan had met while they were both campaigning for Bush. Rice was eager and had time to devote to the cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rice's confrontational style was already part of her reputation. As a charter member of the local Black Republican Club, party leaders had to ask her to stop passing out homemade buttons that read &quot;Democratic Party, Poverty Pimps&quot; at a campaign event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like nearly everyone else originally part of the NBRA, Cadogan has since dropped out. The original board included eight members from around the country, and Rice's husband. In a matter of months, all the board members except Rice, her husband and Cadogan resigned. E-mails provided by one former board member detail that Rice's style had led to the resignations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Hurricane Katrina, for example, Rice insisted on sending out a press release praising President Bush's response to the disaster. The board balked because members thought Bush's response was imperfect at best, and those who died or lost their homes were disproportionately black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burstion-Donbraye said Rice's efforts seemed to lack common sense and ignore the variety of opinions within the Republican Party. She resigned, fearing her reputation was at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don Scoggins of Virginia, former NBRA board member and president of Republicans for Black Empowerment, said the board disagreed with Rice's attack strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would tell her, 'You can't go around bashing the Democratic Party and then expect them to come to our side in droves,' &quot; Scoggins said. &quot;She would take the approach, 'Well, you're not a real Republican, then.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rice said board members left because they disagreed on organizational rules, and that what happened at the beginning of the organization was &quot;not relevant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today the organization's vice chairman is Richard St. Paul, a city councilman in New Rochelle, N.Y., who declined to be interviewed, saying the association's rules allowed only Rice to speak to media. The only other person with a leadership role is Darlene Wood-Harvey, the secretary and treasurer, who, according to her personal Web site, is white and an artist who has lived in Sarasota and Virginia. She did not respond to e-mail and phone messages. The e-mail address listed for her on the NBRA Web site goes to Rice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonprofit status questioned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without a board to back Rice, building grassroots support fell to a conservative campaign operation out of Washington, D.C. BMW Direct is known for its direct mail campaigns that, at least initially, cost nearly as much as they bring in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For two years, BMW Direct ran a 527 political fundraising committee for the NBRA, called the Black Republican Freedom Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1,000 members signed up and began receiving copies of The Black Republican magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But of the $400,000 raised in donations to the NBRA in the 2006 election cycle, 80 percent went back to BMW Direct or to pay other fundraising costs, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rice managed to put up a &quot;Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican&quot; billboard in South Carolina in 2006, and, leading up to the elections, ran a radio ad in swing states. In the ad a black woman says, &quot;Dr. King was a real man,&quot; and another responds, &quot;You know he was a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rice said she wanted to start a conversation about the history of the Republican Party. The tactic proved its worth in media coverage. She ticks off the news outlets that covered the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I spent a few thousand and garnered half a million in free coverage by my estimate,&quot; Rice said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the coverage was never what she hoped for. She considered the reporters who wrote about her liberals who sought to denigrate her organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typical of some of her interactions with the media, when Hillsborough Community College Prof. Keith Berry hosted Rice on his weekly political radio show, he eventually had to hang up on her because he could not get a question in once Rice started talking about the history of the two parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You would have flunked my history class,&quot; Berry told Rice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rice closed the 527 in December according to IRS records and its former treasurer, Scott Mackenzie of BMW Direct, who said she was no longer using the firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So for the past seven months, donations have come through the nonprofit NBRA -- which leading experts in campaign finance say could be illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonprofits such as the NBRA, which is classified as a 501 (c)(4) under the IRS code, are not allowed to help elect candidates or push partisan politics as their primary purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's suspicious,&quot; said Stephen Weissman, associate director for policy at the Campaign Finance Institute. &quot;There are grounds to be concerned, and I think there's enough reasons why the IRS should be concerned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonprofits such as the NBRA are not required to name their contributors, and it is exempt from paying taxes because the group is supposed to be furthering the general &quot;social welfare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of the University of Miami's graduate taxation program, Frances Hill, said the NBRA seemed to be in clear violation of the law. Hill, who donated $1,500 to Hillary Clinton, testified before Congress on the need for stricter oversight of political group's finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their name alone and what they appear to be promoting, also the link to the McCain campaign on their Web site, all appears to be problematic -- you can't get more inconsistent with exempt status than that,&quot; said Hill, who also directs the tax program at the Campaign Legal Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rice described the purpose of the association as educating African-Americans and returning them to their Republican Party roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have been convinced wrongly the Republican Party is a racist party,&quot; Rice said. &quot;Black voters feel they have no choice, because they don't want to vote for the party of the Ku Klux Klan. We tell them, 'You are in bed with the party of the Ku Klux Klan.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She declined to provide a list of current donors, saying that if she did the media would use it to &quot;trash us.&quot; She said primary contributors include herself, her family members, and &quot;hundreds of thousands of little people all around the country giving $5 or $10.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an initial interview, Rice declined to respond to requests to answer follow-up questions, including those about how the organization operates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Childhood lessons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frances Rice learned to be tough at an early age. Growing up poor in Atlanta during segregation shaped her political views, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When her father left the family, Rice helped raise her four siblings in a government housing project. She was 12, and her mother took a job working long hours in a laundry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We succeeded because she instilled personal responsibility,&quot; Rice said. &quot;If she had bought into a socialist policy of government handouts we'd still be poor there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She went on to earn a law degree and an MBA. She retired after 20 years in the U.S. Army as a lieutenant colonel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rice's brother, Ralph Lee Presley, who runs a youth program in Atlanta, said his sister became a Republican to escape associations with the poverty she grew up in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rice said she blames the Democratic Party for the racism she experienced growing up and believes the party is responsible for perpetuating poverty in the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rice attended Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr.'s father preached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Daddy King&quot; as he was called, was a Republican, but, according to Taylor Branch, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who studied the King family, he publicly switched his allegiance to the Democrats and said he would vote for John F. Kennedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Luther King Jr. took care not to claim any political party, said Clayborne Carson, a professor at Stanford University who directs the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute. But there are photos of him campaigning for President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat, in 1964. Many blacks became Democrats during the civil rights movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rice's brother said the rest of Rice's family became Democrats, too, and they still are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with other things, Rice makes her own choices. To disregard her as an agitator would be to overlook the resolve and discipline she brings even to her personal life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At just over 5 feet tall, she is slender. She walks on a treadmill at 5.6 mph. every day for two miles and lifts weights. She does not eat sugar, salt, or dairy. Sleep is eight hours every night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It takes a lot of talent, energy, time, dedication and willingness to be trashed by the mainstream media in order to do this,&quot; Rice said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff writer David Gulliver and researcher Cindy Allegretto contributed to this report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A MESSAGE OVER THE AIRWAVES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of one of three radio ads being run by the National Black Republican Association on talk radio station WLSS:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dr. King said judge people by the content of their character, not the color of their skin. Barack Obama sounds good but character is judged by action when no one is looking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama voted 'No' on the minimum wage bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama said 'No' to school choice scholarships for poor black children trapped in failing schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama voted 'Yes' for a bill that killed babies born alive in a botched abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Bitter' is what Obama called blacks and whites who love God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Racist' is what Obama called his white grandmother who raised him and made sacrifices so Obama could get a good education and become a millionaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's friends are unrepentant terrorists Bill Ayers and Rev. Wright, who said innocent Americans deserved to die on Sept. 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is an arrogant elitist who turns his back on poor blacks in his own country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama was warmly received Saturday as he used the annual convention of the National Urban League to recall his days as a community organizer in Chicago shortly after he graduated from college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He talked about working for a group of churches to help families &quot;that had been devastated&quot; when the local steel plants closed. He helped set up job training programs for the unemployed and after-school programs for the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That work taught me a fundamental truth that has guided me to this day, that change doesn't come from the top down, it comes from the bottom up,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a message that resonated with the largely minority crowd of 3,000 -- about twice the number John McCain drew for a speech on Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He seemed to identify strongly with the audience and audience seemed to identify strongly with him,&quot; said Walter Brame, head of the Urban League in Grand Rapids, Mich. &quot;I'm impressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's affinity with the group, which has outlined a detailed plan for improving &quot;economic equality&quot; across the country, was no surprise. He attended the league's annual convention last year and promised to open the White House to the group in 2010, when the Urban League will celebrate its 100th anniversary as an organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the next administration, I expect the White House will be the people's house,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That comment about the &quot;people's house,&quot; which capped Obama's 22-minute speech and a brief question-and-answer period, was the favorite part of the Illinois senator's appearance for Maribeth Norman, an Urban League member and postmaster in West Palm Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That includes everybody, every ethnicity, race and gender,&quot; Norman said. &quot;I think it was a very powerful speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama's promise also encapsulates the challenge he faces as the first African-American candidate to be nominated for the presidency by a major party. Can he bring together a political coalition that successfully crosses racial and class lines? Like McCain did the day before him, Obama made no direct reference to racial politics -- an issue that has gained prominence in the campaign in recent days as Obama had asserted McCain was trying to scare voters about his rival. But the issue was clearly on the minds of many of the Urban League participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Obama is a role model, not only for black Americans, but for all citizens,&quot; said Gregory Jackson, 40, who works with the Girl Scouts of the USA in New York. He said Obama's candidacy shows &quot;that the American dream is more than just an experiment -- it's a reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally I think he has been treading very carefully,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;But I think he should own the fact that he is a person of color. He shouldn't have to walk away from that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While saying he did not see racial overtones in McCain's remarks, Brame, who teaches sociology at a community college, said he was disappointed that McCain used his Urban League appearance to attack Obama over his &quot;style.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Charisma and speaking have been an attribute until now,&quot; Brame said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the focus ought to be on the issues that this country faces and not comparing the senator with movie stars, Moses and Charlton Heston,&quot; Brame said, referring to McCain ads that accuse Obama of being a &quot;celebrity&quot; like Paris Hilton and Britney Spears and an Internet ad that calls Obama &quot;the One&quot; while comparing him to Heston's movie portrayal of a Biblical leader who parted the Red Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also made a reference to the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We face serious issues in this election -- and we have real differences,&quot; Obama said. &quot;I'm not going to spend time assaulting my opponent's character. I'm not going to spend time talking about Paris and Britney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he would rather contrast himself with McCain on economic issues, accusing his opponent of wanting to keep tax breaks for &quot;companies that ship jobs overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to end them and start giving incentives to companies that create jobs here at home,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Obama has enjoyed extraordinary support among African-American voters, he has also faced sharp criticism from some traditional civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who say Obama's message that blacks need to take more personal responsibility is insensitive to their plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama did not shy away from the personal responsibility message on Saturday. He outlined details for improving education, including calling for a stronger financial role for the federal government in helping poor school districts improve their facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he also said education will not be improved &quot;just by more money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of all we've got to have parents who are turning off the TV set and putting away the video games, meeting with the teachers and making sure your child is doing the homework and providing the discipline,&quot; Obama said. &quot;All of those things are important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League and a former mayor of New Orleans, said he disagreed with those leaders who have criticized Obama over his personal responsibility message, which Obama highlighted in a Father's Day speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Being able to sort of talk to people about tough issues is the hallmark of a strong leader,&quot; Morial said. &quot;Sometimes we do hear from leaders things that we don't want to hear because they may be challenging our actions, our conduct, our behavior.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morial said his organization has advocated similar messages for all parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's the right thing to do to challenge ourselves to be better at that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson, the Girl Scout representative, said while he waited in line to enter the convention hall where Obama spoke, he and other Urban League members talked about what they perceived as the unfair criticism Obama received over a new rap song from Ludacris that includes vulgar lyrics referring to Hillary Clinton, McCain and George W. Bush. Obama has condemned the song.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why should Obama be held accountable for a lyric from a rap artist?&quot; Jackson said, adding that Ludacris &quot;works in a for-profit industry and generating controversy is what sells records, especially in hip-hop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said Obama should not be criticized for having other Ludacris songs on his iPod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Should every politician have his iPod vetted?&quot; Jackson asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Brown, a 57-year-old hotel industry employee from Orlando, said she originally supported Clinton but likes Obama because he &quot;has good, strong values.&quot; She said she agrees with Obama's criticism of some of the rap artists' lyrics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With grandkids and great grandkids, I have a whole wide spectrum of music played at my house,&quot; Brown said. &quot;I even dance to some of that music. But some of the things they say kind of turn me off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tinashe Batia, a 22-year-old University of Maryland student, said she likes Obama because she sees him as a &quot;true public servant&quot; who is modest but &quot;wants to make an impact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like he's trying to reach out to all people, including my generation too,&quot; she said. Batia also said Obama, whose father was black and whose mother is white, may be in a unique position to help bridge racial differences in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anyone knows anything about both sides of the race issue, it would be him,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">TALLAHASSEE </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has spent more money on television ads in Florida in the past two months than he spent in any other state, according to a new survey from University of Wisconsin political scientists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the question remains, what did the 7,000 ads -- which ran between June 3 and July 26 in Florida -- yield politically for Obama? His supporters can argue that the advertising blitz allowed him to close the gap with the better-known Republican candidate, John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain supporters can point out that the $5 million Obama spent in Florida has not given him a lead -- the latest poll shows the race essentially tied -- despite the fact that McCain ran no Florida ads during the same period, although he has previously advertised in the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data collected by Wisconsin's Advertising Project show Obama, who has been very successful at raising money, is trying to expand the presidential &quot;playing field&quot; by campaigning hard in states Democrats have not carried in the last two elections. In addition to Florida, Obama has also advertised in Alaska, Georgia, Indiana, Montana and North Carolina -- states that neither Al Gore in 2000 nor John Kerry in 2004 won. Like Florida, McCain has also not run any recent ads in those Republican-leaning or &quot;red&quot; states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is certainly worth noting that Obama is up in these red states and has the airways all to himself,&quot; said Ken Goldstein, the Wisconsin professor who directs the advertising project. &quot;That said, we won't really know if he's expanding the playing field until September.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldstein noted that Democrats tried to expand the field in the 2004 race by early advertising in such states as Arizona and Virginia, but dropped that advertising in the final weeks of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also noted the heaviest advertising is occurring in the Midwest, where both Obama and McCain are on the airwaves. In fact, Florida, where only Obama is advertising, ranks fourth in total spending, falling behind Pennsylvania ($10.3 million); Ohio ($6.4 million) and Michigan ($6 million), according to the UW survey that is based on data collected by TNS Media Intelligence/CMAG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldstein also said it wasn't a surprise that negative advertising -- which is picking up tempo with McCain's latest ad slamming Obama for being a &quot;celebrity&quot; -- is a key feature in the race, particularly for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey showed that 90 percent of Obama's ads were positive during the survey period and did not mention McCain. In contrast, a third of McCain's ads were negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldstein said the negative ads, which were being run both by McCain and the Republican National Committee, were an attempt to undermine the initial advantage the Democrats have this year, with voters more favorably inclined toward the out-of-power party while expressing worries about the economy and the war in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What the McCain campaign needs to do is convince the electorate that Barack Obama is not a credible commander-in-chief and to do that they need to run negative ads,&quot; Goldstein said. &quot;What Sen. Obama's campaign and campaign advertising needs to do is persuade people that he is a credible president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is he or isn't he?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he does not appear to be one of the frontrunners, Gov. Charlie Crist sidestepped questions this week about whether the McCain campaign was seriously considering him as a vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One clear indication of that would be that McCain advisers were conducting a deep background check -- or a &quot;vetting&quot; -- of Crist as a possible running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the campaign was seeking information and documents from him, Crist told reporters in Tallahassee, &quot;I can't comment on the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he wanted to be the vice presidential candidate, Crist further elaborated: &quot;I want John McCain to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National pundits weren't any more successful in getting a straight answer from Crist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News' Sean Hannity asked the governor if he was being &quot;vetted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't discuss the process,&quot; Crist replied. &quot;I'm enjoying being governor of Florida. It's the greatest job I've ever had in my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But would he take the job if offered? &quot;Well, it's not been, so that's really a hypothetical question.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama &quot;shunned the opportunity to talk to soldiers to thank them for their service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chain e-mail, on July 22</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just after Obama visited Afghanistan on July 19, a scathing e-mail from a captain at Bagram Air Base spread. &quot;As you know I am not a very political person,&quot; the attack begins. &quot;I just wanted to pass along that Senator Obama came to Bagram Afghanistan for about an hour on his visit to 'The War Zone'. I wanted to share with you what happened.&quot; What happened, according to the author, is that Obama went straight from his plane to a bulletproof vehicle, then to a meeting with a general, ignoring a line of soldiers waiting to shake his hand.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterward, &quot;he again shunned the opportunity to talk to Soldiers to thank them for their service,&quot; the author wrote. We've examined chain e-mails in depth, and found a great many contain falsehoods. This is unexceptional in that regard. Obama and the two senators with him did not brush off the troops, said Capt. Christian Patterson, a spokesman for the Army's Combined Joint Task Force-101 at Bagram Air Field. In fact, briefings &quot;were delayed as the senators took time to shake hands, speak to troops, and pose for photographs,&quot; said a press release issued by the Army. It goes on: &quot;While CJTF-101 cannot say if this blog is authentic, the comments in it are inappropriate and factually incorrect.&quot; But because the military directly and unequivocally contradicted the most damaging allegations at issue - that Obama shunned troops on various occasions, - we rule this claim False.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain got more money from Airbus' U.S. executives than any other politician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign Money Watch, June 9 in a TV ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An independent political group has begun airing a TV ad that paints Sen. John McCain as a bought-and-paid-for politician. An announcer in the TV ad states: &quot;Seven of McCain's staff and fundraisers lobbied for Airbus&quot; and &quot;McCain got more money from Airbus' U.S. executives than any other politician.&quot; Turns out, the ad is on target. Former McCain finance chairman Thomas G. Loeffler's firm lobbied for Airbus' parent company EADS. Loeffler's lobbying ties led to his departure from the McCain campaign in March. Susan E. Nelson left Loeffler's lobbying firm to be McCain's finance director. William L. Ball III, a former secretary of the Navy and frequent McCain surrogate, and John Green, who took a leave from Ogilvy Public Relations to serve as McCain's legislative liaison, also have lobbied for EADS. And three McCain fundraising bundlers - Kirk Blalock, Kirsten Chadwick and Aleix Jarvis - are with Fierce Isakowitz &amp; Blalock, which has done lobbying work for EADS, according to campaign finance records at Opensecrets.org and Public Citizen. As for political contributions, the Center for Responsive Politics prepared a report for PolitiFact that backs that up. U.S. employees of EADS/Airbus have contributed $15,700 in this election cycle to McCain's campaign. The next highest recipient was Mark Warner, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, who has gotten $2,800. Given those numbers, we rule this claim True.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You could be forgiven if you have the impression we have two presidents of late - one elected, the other acting as if the November election is a mere formality. George W. Bush still holds the keys to the White House, but Barack Obama is assuming the trappings of office to a degree never before seen in American politics. And then there is John McCain, for whom even the role of underdog appears to be a challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush still has exclusive rights to Hail to the Chief and Air Force One. For now at least, Obama has to settle for a campaign plane dubbed O-Force One. For a while, Obama spoke from lecterns adorned with his own faux presidential seal, which included an eagle with arrows in one talon and olive branches in the other. The seal was quickly retired after it was mocked as another example of Obama's hubris. It's not just the aura of the Obama campaign - it's the attitude. Even Obama's once adoring press corps has begun to complain that his campaign is increasingly characterized by secrecy, arrogance and even vindictiveness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama won't officially claim the Democratic nomination until Aug. 28, and when he does, the event will take place in a Denver football stadium that can hold up to 75,000 cheering fans. Obama apparently is too big a star for an ordinary convention hall. According to the Atlantic magazine, he already has directed his staff to begin planning for the transition to the White House. And on his trip to the Middle East and Europe he told reporters he wanted to acquaint himself with foreign leaders &quot;who I expect to be dealing with over the next 8 to 10 years.'' Presidents, of course, are limited to two four-year terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama has long been his party's presumptive nominee,'' wrote Dana Milbank of the Washington Post last week. &quot;Now he's becoming its presumptuous nominee.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milbank went on: &quot;Fresh from his presidential-style world tour, during which foreign leaders and American generals lined up to show him affection, Obama settled down to some presidential-style business in Washington yesterday (July 29). He ordered up a teleconference with the (current president's) Treasury secretary, granted an audience to the Pakistani prime minister and had his staff arrange for the chairman of the Federal Reserve to give him a briefing. Then, he went up to Capitol Hill to be adored by House Democrats in a presidential-style pep rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Along the way, he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual president's. Traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long, presidential-style motorcade, while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities. ... '</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a witness Milbank did not name, Obama told House Democrats, &quot;This is the moment ... the world has been waiting for,'' adding: &quot;I have become a symbol of the possibility of America returning to our best traditions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe a Bible verse is in order here. The book of Proverbs warns us: &quot;Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much Obama can the country take before succumbing to charisma fatigue? His president-in-waiting demeanor could turn off some undecided voters. According to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll, the election could be less a contest between Obama and McCain than a referendum on Obama. Many voters are still struggling to reach a comfort level with him, which may explain why McCain remains within striking distance of Obama in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, McCain has cast himself as the underdog even as he struggles to come across as presidential. Like a real president, McCain has started delivering a weekly radio address. Earlier this year, the presumptive GOP nominee traveled to the Middle East, and more recently to Latin America. However, his trips were largely ignored by the news media, including the three television network anchors who tagged along with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing presidential is the least of McCain's problems; he needs to show that he is more competent than his snake-bit campaign suggests. Are voters supposed to believe this guy can organize a government when he can't organize a campaign?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain can't stay on message because, as far as I can tell, he has no coherent message. He keeps flailing away at Obama, calling him an elitist one day and questioning his patriotism the next. And now the McCain campaign is running an ad comparing Obama's celebrity to that of pop stars Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. According to Politico.com, a McCain campaign memo asserted that &quot;only celebrities like Barack Obama go to the gym three times a day, demand MET-RX chocolate roasted-peanut protein bars and bottles of hard-to-find organic brew Black Forest Berry Tea and worry about the price of arugula.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now there's a message that could take off: Barack Obama is a vain health nut who is about as qualified to be commander-in-chief as Paris Hilton. Real presidents eat red meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it too late for John McCain to start over?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, for now, John McCain is the $8-million man and Barack Obama is the $7-million man. It's that close in presidential campaign contributions - as of June 30 - gathered from the Sunshine State, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kudos to McCain's fundraising here since his campaign's contributions are eclipsed by Obama on the national level. Nationwide, McCain's raised $145.5-million, while Obama's way out in front with more than $339-million, according to the center's data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But let's go from macro to micro. Typically, the vast majority of the U.S. and Florida community of business executives vote Republican, while more working stiffs tend to lean Democratic. That seems again to be the case, based on a close look at individual campaign contributions from Tampa Bay area business leaders. But it's not as Republican here as you might think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, there is a traditional McCain stronghold of fundraisers symbolized by such party stalwarts as the Sembler real estate development family in St. Petersburg, financier William R. Hough and Blake Caspers of the Caspers Co., a big owner of area McDonald's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Obama has his backers among business folks, too. Consider the contributions from Beltz &amp; Ruth attorney Larry Beltz, retired auto dealer and investor Frank Morsani, HSN executive Marty Nealow and Rooms To Go CEO Jeffrey Seaman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank ramps up collection efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alabama-based Colonial BancGroup is not taking its disappointing second-quarter earnings lightly. After a loss of $8.9-million in the second quarter, the bank boosted its collections staff by 51 percent and created a &quot;war room&quot; in Tampa focused on 42 foreclosed or problem credits worth $325-million to help rid the bank of soured loans and foreclosed properties, Colonial CEO Robert E. Lowder told analysts in a recent conference call. &quot;Their objectives over the next two quarters (are) to dispose of those properties and those loans at full value and we think that we do a good job of doing that,&quot; Lowder said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day after his campaign accused Democrat Barack Obama of trying to deflect criticism by playing the &quot;race card,&quot; likely Republican presidential nominee John McCain defended his views on affirmative action and school vouchers in sometimes spirited exchanges with a mostly black audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spoke Friday to about 1,000 people at the National Urban League convention. Obama is scheduled to speak to the same group today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You'll hear from my opponent, Sen. Obama, tomorrow, and if there's one thing he always delivers it's a great speech,&quot; McCain said. &quot;But I hope you'll listen carefully, because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric. And this is especially true in the case of the Urban League's agenda of opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain touted vouchers and charter schools as a way of improving education for students in failing schools. He said Obama's opposition to vouchers amounts to favoring the interests of teacher unions over the needs of struggling students. And he said Obama's economic policies would hurt minority businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's speech lasted about 20 minutes and was interrupted a few times by polite applause. Things got more lively immediately afterward when he fielded audience questions for more than half an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The issue is not charter schools,&quot; one man told McCain. He said even blacks with good education and advanced degrees are denied opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Charter schools are not the answer, but they are part of the answer,&quot; McCain said. Later, he added, &quot;Don't you also feel an obligation to the next generation of young Americans who are growing up in poverty and do not have access to a quality education?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another questioner got big applause when he challenged McCain on affirmative action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why in an America where there are disparities, alarming disparities ... would you want to eliminate programs that document that so we understand where we are and where we need to go?&quot; the man asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Affirmative action is in the eye of the beholder. ... We should provide equal economic opportunities for all Americans,&quot; McCain said. He said he rejects race-based quotas, but said that doesn't eliminate &quot;our ability to assist small businesses, the economically disadvantaged and others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain drew groans when he cited the U.S. military as a good example of an institution that provides equal opportunities for advancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also was asked why he voted in 1983 against making Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a federal holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because I was wrong,&quot; McCain replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday's controversy over the &quot;race card&quot; accusation did not come up during the hour McCain spent with the group. But it was on the minds of many attendees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It makes you look worse. ... People don't appreciate that,&quot; said real estate broker Patsy Johnson of Washington. She said she is leaning toward Obama, but &quot;I thought it was great&quot; that McCain answered questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find it interesting that (McCain) would address a group full of African-Americans, obviously appealing to a particular race ... but when Obama addresses anything to do with race, he's playing the race card. There seems to be a conflict,&quot; said Cedric Davis of Seattle, who works for a foundation that helps youths in foster care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis said it was &quot;insulting&quot; that McCain equated affirmative action with quotas and said he disagrees with McCain's emphasis on charter schools and vouchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Davis, who said he is leaning toward Obama, said McCain helped himself by appearing before the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although I found there were some disconnects, I have to admit that I was able to at least connect with him a little bit simply because he came and addressed us,&quot; Davis said. &quot;I think that's the first step in building a relationship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain traveled to the Florida Panhandle, where he pushed for oil drilling off Florida and defended campaign ads that mock Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need oil drilling and we need it now. We need it offshore. The only thing I've heard him say is we should inflate our tires,&quot; McCain said at a news conference in Panama City Beach, where Gov. Charlie Crist accompanied him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain brushed off criticism of a recent ad likening Obama to celebrities Britney Spears and Paris Hilton and another that sarcastically compares Obama to Moses in the movie The Ten Commandments starring Charlton Heston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said the ads are humorous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think the campaign is negative in the slightest. We think it's got a lot of humor in it and we're enjoying it,&quot; McCain said. &quot;I'm the underdog and will continue to fight and scrap all the way to Nov. 4.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain attacks Obama on several fronts in campaign appearances in Orlando.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain attacked Sen. Barack Obama in Orlando as a hostage to teachers unions and defended a TV ad mocking his rival as a superficial celebrity before cozying up to a star of his own Friday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can I get a yeehaw?&quot; country singer John Rich shouted before about 1,000 people gathered for an outdoor concert. Rich played his new song, Raisin' McCain, as the Arizona Republican took the stage and urged the crowd to &quot;get out the vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the humid, honky-tonk atmosphere belied the uglier shade that the presidential race took on this week with negative TV ads and the injection of the explosive issue of race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Obama told supporters in Missouri that Republicans would try to scare voters because he doesn't &quot;look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.&quot; McCain's campaign responded by saying that Obama was playing the &quot;race card,&quot; something Obama denies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain stood by the remark Friday and denied that his ads and statements have violated his pledge to run a respectful campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He brought up the issue. I responded to it because I'm disappointed, and I don't want the issue to be part of this campaign,&quot; he told reporters during a pre-concert news conference in which he once again called for offshore oil drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sparring continued throughout the day as both candidates campaigned across Florida. McCain released a Web-only ad that derides Obama as a presumptuous, messiah-like figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to display a sense of humor in this campaign,&quot; McCain said. The Obama campaign called it &quot;juvenile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show the race as a dead heat, and the stakes for McCain are huge: To win the presidency, he must win the Sunshine State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, Republican-rich North Florida must deliver big to offset the expected large turnout for Obama in South Florida and the Tampa Bay area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida will be a swing state, my friends,&quot; McCain told hundreds at the concert. &quot;The Panhandle will matter. ... Let me just say I need your support. I've always put my country first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comments from the crowd revealed one of the issues that has dogged McCain since he got into the race: Conservatives don't think he is conservative enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Am I excited about him? Hmmm,&quot; said Jonathan Ferrell, 36, a medical supplies salesman. &quot;I'm excited about the Republican Party, not John McCain. But he's better than a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former state House Speaker Allan Bense, R-Panama City, predicted the Panhandle will turn out in droves for McCain. &quot;Support is not soft up here,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Away from the spotlight, McCain and Gov. Charlie Crist attended a fundraiser at a locally renowned seafood restaurant, Capt. Anderson's, that generated an estimated $750,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking before an influential African-American group in Orlando, McCain called for expanding private school vouchers and accused Obama of opposing them and being captive to teachers unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My opponent talks a great deal about hope and change, and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness,&quot; McCain told the National Urban League. &quot;If Sen. Obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform, then he should start looking for new slogans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Focusing on vouchers was a shrewd move for McCain; blacks are more receptive to the idea than other Democrats. The overall response to McCain in Orlando, however, was muted. He drew gasps for praising former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was accused of using tough police tactics in a quest to clean up his city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And McCain said affirmative action was &quot;in the eye of the beholder,&quot; not mentioning he supports an anti-affirmative action referendum on the ballot in Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign called the speech &quot;another dishonest attack&quot; and cited Obama's support for a charter school in Illinois as well as pushing for an &quot;army&quot; of new teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information from the Associated Press was used in this report.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain's campaign on Wednesday aired and defended a television advertisement that compares Democratic rival Barack Obama to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's the biggest celebrity in the world,&quot; an announcer says as viewers see quick photos of Hilton and Spears cut into scenes from Obama's speech to 200,000 people in Berlin last week. &quot;But is he ready to lead?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, the latest McCain effort to gain traction against Obama, notes the Democrat's opposition to offshore oil drilling and accuses him of favoring higher taxes on electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain aides acknowledged the 30-second ad is as much about image as issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign manager Rick Davis said the Spears and Hilton photos were included to &quot;demonstrate that the focus of the Obama campaign has been as much to create that celebrity status of his as it is to discuss the hard issues that the American people are forced to debate during the course of this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we decided to do is find the top three international celebrities in the world,&quot; Davis said. &quot;And I would say, from our estimations, Britney and Paris came in second and third.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain adviser Steve Schmidt also chided Obama as &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's backed up by the reality of his tour around the world. He has many fans,&quot; Schmidt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question that we are posing to the American people,&quot; Schmidt said, &quot;is this: Is he ready to lead yet? And the answer to the question that we will offer to the American people is no, that he is not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is airing in 11 closely fought states: Ohio, Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, campaigning in Missouri, said he pays no attention to McCain's ads, &quot;although I do notice he doesn't seem to have anything to say very positive about himself. He seems to only be talking about me. You need to ask John McCain what he's for and not just what he's against.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor, declining specific comment on the effort to link Obama with Spears and Hilton, did drop in a reference to a Spears song.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a day when major news organizations across the country are taking Sen. McCain to task for a steady stream of false, negative attacks, his campaign has launched yet another. Or, as some might say, 'Oops! He did it again,' &quot; Vietor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also drew criticism from former longtime McCain adviser John Weaver, who told TheAtlantic.com that it seemed &quot;childish&quot; and &quot;diminishes John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATIONAL; TIMES EDITORIALS; Pg. 10A</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">508 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Straight Talk Express has taken a nasty turn into the gutter. Sen. John McCain has resorted to lies and distortions in what sounds like an increasingly desperate attempt to slow down Sen. Barack Obama by raising questions about his patriotism. Instead of taking the Democrat down a few notches, these baseless attacks are raising more questions about the Republican's campaign and his ability to control his temper. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most offensive line comes from McCain himself. The Arizona senator has repeated that Obama &quot;would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign.'' That is one of the more outrageous statements by a major political party candidate seeking the presidency. The looming choices about the long-festering war in Iraq are not between winning and losing but about how quickly or slowly the United States can reduce its military forces without jeopardizing recent security gains. Even McCain acknowledges that, and insulting Obama in such a reckless way is not presidential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is only one example of the darker tone enveloping the McCain campaign since several of Karl Rove's acolytes took the wheel. A new McCain&nbsp;ad suggests that while Obama traveled abroad last week he &quot;made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops. Seems the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras.'' That's a compelling punch line, but it's below the belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What actually happened: Obama planned to visit wounded troops at a medical center in Germany until the Pentagon said it would not allow him to bring a retired Air Force major general who is one of the campaign's foreign policy advisers. The Democrat may have been poised to blur the line between political events and official troop visits by members of Congress. But there is no evidence that he was snubbing soldiers because he could not appear with them on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has even attempted to plant doubts about whether Obama is a socialist. He said earlier this month that the Democrat's voting record &quot;is more to the left than the announced socialist in the United States Senate, Bernie Sanders of Vermont.'' Asked whether he thought Obama is a socialist, McCain responded: &quot;I don't know. All I know is his voting record, and that's what people usually judge their elected representatives by.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a classic smear campaign. As the Times' PolitiFact notes, the National Journal rated Obama the most liberal senator by analyzing just 99 of 442 votes last year. He did not finish near the top in two previous years, and other ranking services rate his record as significantly less liberal than Sanders'. But McCain was not troubled by the details. He mentioned Obama and socialist in the same sentence, and the seeds of doubt were planted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virtually all candidates, including Obama, distort their opponent's record. But McCain has gone beyond reasonable bounds. The self-described &quot;happy warrior'' in the 2000 presidential campaign has turned sour in 2008, and the candor and straight talk that once made him such an attractive candidate are rapidly disappearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Treasure Coast surgeon and Republican activist who oversaw the care of wounded U.S. troops in Germany says presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama showed &quot;bad judgment&quot; in canceling a visit to a military hospital there during his recent world travels. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Slobodan &quot;Danny&quot; Jazarevic, who left West Palm Beach in 2002 to be chief of trauma and vascular surgery and critical care at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, said Tuesday that wounded troops always appreciate visits from U.S. officials and celebrities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jazarevic, a colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve, lives in Stuart and is running in a GOP primary for a Treasure Coast state House seat. Republican presidential candidate John McCain's campaign asked him to speak to reporters about the Landstuhl controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign has slammed Obama for canceling the visit to Landstuhl. It released an ad this week that says Obama &quot;made time to go to the gym, but canceled a visit with wounded troops. Seems the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign said it never planned to bring reporters or cameras along, and pointed out that he did not invite the media earlier in the trip when he visited wounded soldiers in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama told reporters in London on Saturday that the Landstuhl visit was called off because of &quot;concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political, and the last thing that I want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not and get caught in the crossfire between the campaigns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jazarevic said an Obama visit to Landstuhl might indeed have been perceived as political. But he said Obama should have gone anyway because it would have boosted the morale of injured troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had congressmen, senators, movie stars, everybody visit Landstuhl. All those troops, they were grateful for someone to come,&quot; Jazarevic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a bad decision on somebody's part to tell (Obama) not to go. It was bad judgment,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if Obama would have been criticized if he had visited the troops, Jazarevic said: &quot;I'm sure he would be. But I think the honor of visiting those troops trumps everything else. They're honored and he should be honored by visiting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jazarevic, 51, is trauma director at Lawnwood Regional Medical Center and Heart Institute in Fort Pierce. He is one of three Republicans running in an Aug. 26 primary for the seat of term-limited state Rep. Gayle Harrell, R-Port St. Lucie.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Democrats budget an unprecedented sum to sell Obama to voters in swing states.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convinced the road to the White House leads through a few swing states with large Hispanic populations, Democrats on Tuesday announced they would spend an unprecedented $20-million to convince Hispanic voters to back Sen. Barack Obama for president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Democratic National Committee says its Hispanic outreach project will target Hispanics nationwide, the program is aimed mainly at four states where party strategists think a strong Hispanic turnout could mean the difference for victory in November: New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado and Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four states have large, established communities of eligible Hispanic voters, as well as strong traditions of Hispanic elected and community leaders. Democrats also came within a few points of winning those states in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Latino voters go for Barack Obama - particularly in states like Florida and Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico - we win,&quot; said Frank Sanchez of Tampa, the chairman of the Obama campaign's Hispanic National Leadership Council, who flew to Washington for the announcement. &quot;If you move those numbers just a little bit, those states go from red to blue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council, which includes political and business leaders from 14 states, is charged with raising much of the $20-million. Sanchez said the money will be used to advertise with Spanish-language TV, radio and newspapers, as well as for precinct-by-precinct outreach, campaign organizing, and paid staff members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats plan to install a director of Hispanic outreach in each of the four targeted states; the Florida director should be named next week, Sanchez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanic members of Congress will be traveling the country on Obama's behalf, and Democrats also are hosting three-day Hispanic &quot;Camp Obama&quot; events in those states to train supporters in the ways of grass roots activism. The next is scheduled for Orlando Aug. 8-10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No campaign, Republican or Democratic, has ever committed such a princely sum to Hispanic outreach before. In 2004, the Republicans and Democrats together spent just $8.7-million on advertising with Spanish-language media, according to an analysis by Johns Hopkins University's Hispanic Voter Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain strategists insists they aren't worried. They noted that McCain already has launched aggressive Hispanic outreach programs, and has aired several Spanish radio and TV ads, including one touting the military service of Hispanics. McCain also has attended all three of the major national conferences of Hispanic activists and elected leaders this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, he traveled to Colombia and Mexico, and has been an outspoken proponent of reforming the U.S. immigration system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he has shifted his emphasis to securing the U.S. borders first, he continues to talk of the need for dealing humanely and practically with the estimated 12-million undocumented workers in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unlike Barack Obama, John McCain doesn't need an introduction to the Hispanic community,&quot; said Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Miami. &quot;John McCain has been working for more than two decades for the values, principles and issues Latinos cares about. Hispanics will elect the next president of the United States based on who has the best record, experience and is better prepared to move this country forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>

She will become deputy chief of staff and legislative affairs director, replacing Towson Fraser, who is going into the private sector (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/2008.7.30%20Fraser%20Resignation.pdf). (Fraser told the Buzz he is not ready to announce his plans.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mears, 38, has worked in state government since 1996, beginning with House Speaker Daniel Webster. She has a BA in political science from FSU and is working toward a master's in public administration. Jaryn Emhoff, aide to outgoing Sen. Webster, will take over at least temporarily for Mears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist also announced today that Dane Eagle will have a broader role, becoming executive deputy chief of staff. Eagle, who has been a travel aide, will work with the Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development.

John McCain's claim that Barack Obama would rather lose the war than lose the presidential race is so repugnant that one of his most prominent surrogates -- Florida Governor Charlie Crist, who's also talked about as a potential Veep -- refused to endorse it....MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, to his credit, pressed Crist at least three times on whether he agrees with the notion that Obama wants to lose the war, and each time, Crist ducked, finally saying: &quot;I have no idea. I would hope not.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign is out with another TV ad that prods Obama as &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world&quot; -- a reference to the overwhelming reception he got in Europe -- but suggests he does not have the substance of a leader. The ad, which can be seen on cable in Florida, again blasts Obama for not supporting offshore oil drilling and misleadingly ties that to higher gas prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a sign of an increasingly aggressive McCain that has some GOP observers worried. &quot;[B]eing aggressive against Obama on questions of leadership and trust and risk are important, but at the same time I think they need to be very careful because McCain is not at his best when he is being overly partisan and negative,&quot; strategist (and familiar face in Florida) Todd Harris told the New York Times in a story published today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathy Mears, the well-respected voice of the Senate President's Office, is taking a job with Gov. Charlie Crist. She will become deputy chief of staff and legislative affairs director, replacing Towson Fraser, who is going into the private sector (http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/files/2008.7.30%20Fraser%20Resignation.pdf). (Fraser told the Buzz he is not ready to announce his plans.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mears, 38, has worked in state government since 1996, beginning with House Speaker Daniel Webster. She has a BA in political science from FSU and is working toward a master's in public administration. Jaryn Emhoff, aide to outgoing Sen. Webster, will take over at least temporarily for Mears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist also announced today that Dane Eagle will have a broader role, becoming executive deputy chief of staff. Eagle, who has been a travel aide, will work with the Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development. The 25-year-old Eagle went to the University of Florida and his father, Greg, is a major Crist backer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberal TalkingPointsMemo is crowing (http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/07/top_mccain_surrogate_refuses_t.php) about Charlie Crist today refusing to back up McCain's attack on Barack Obama: &quot;This is pretty great. John McCain's claim that Barack Obama would rather lose the war than lose the presidential race is so repugnant that one of his most prominent surrogates -- Florida Governor Charlie Crist, who's also talked about as a potential Veep -- refused to endorse it....MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, to his credit, pressed Crist at least three times on whether he agrees with the notion that Obama wants to lose the war, and each time, Crist ducked, finally saying: &quot;I have no idea. I would hope not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looked at another way, though, our affable governor said Obama might be willing to lose a war to win an election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain will make remarks at the concert but his campaign said today that he will not field questions from the audience. The Republican Party of Florida said the event will be outside the Marina Civic Center. Gates open at 3 p.m. and the concert begins at 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain may also host one of his &quot;Tele-Town Halls&quot; after arriving in Orlando Thursday evening. No word yet whether the live conference call will be with Florida voters. In the past, he has been on the campaign trail in one state but fields questions from another state.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign is out with another TV ad that prods Obama as &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world&quot; -- a reference to the overwhelming reception he got in Europe -- but suggests he does not have the substance of a leader. The ad, which can be seen on cable in Florida, again blasts Obama for not supporting offshore oil drilling and misleadingly ties that to higher gas prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a sign of an increasingly aggressive McCain that has some GOP observers worried. &quot;[B]eing aggressive against Obama on questions of leadership and trust and risk are important, but at the same time I think they need to be very careful because McCain is not at his best when he is being overly partisan and negative,&quot; strategist (and familiar face in Florida) Todd Harris told the New York Times in a story published today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State employees didn't get a raise this year, prompting UF to recently announce it will use tuition revenues to boost pay anyway. And the ratio of students to tenure and tenure-track ratio, the worst in the country at 27.3 to 1, has declined 45 percent since 1989-90.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board says universities need to hire 1,600 new faculty members just to get to the national average.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was taken aback Saturday to open the St. Petersburg Times and find the op-ed by John McCain that was rejected by the New York Times. I thought you were giving Sen. McCain a break. I was wrong. It was the New York Times that gave him a break by not letting this drivel onto its pages. The St. Petersburg Times, by running the piece, has allowed McCain to write his own fitting epitaph to a week where we watched him move from slightly befuddled candidate to a running joke as he confused recent Iraq history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's myopic view of the Iraq conflict is in full view, in this piece, when he says about Obama, &quot;I am also dismayed that he never talks about winning the war - only of ending it. But if we don't win the war, our enemies will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This total lack of understanding of how occupations and insurgencies end - insurgents generally win by wearing down an occupier's political will to fight over a prolonged period, not by defeating them on the field - gives a very broad hint that John McCain's mind is still mired in the lessons in conventional tactics he learned at Annapolis (where he finished 894th out of 899). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was reported that David Shipley, New York Times editor who turned down McCain's op-ed, said that the article, &quot;would have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory.&quot; But this is where the senator, who can be heard regularly roaring about his war and foreign policy bona fides, is never clear. He cannot tell us what &quot;victory&quot; is or what he means by &quot;winning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need a global thinker in the White House, not another flag-waver who attempts to reduce the complexity of the Middle East to them vs. us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D.B. Hessler, Tampa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't squander Iraq gains - July 26, commentary by John McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidate resorts tocrass political attack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How ironic that on the same day the Times printed a letter to the editor taking you to task for publishing what amounted to a free political ad for John McCain, you chose to run yet another free McCain campaign piece. Even worse, you published a McCain op-ed the New York Times had rejected as being overly partisan and poorly written.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times had solid journalistic reasons for rejecting this piece. Their editors recognized it for what it was: a campaign press release attacking Barack Obama, rather than a legitimate op-ed column. They invited McCain to rewrite the piece, asking that it &quot;articulate, in concrete terms, how Sen. McCain defines victory in Iraq. It would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory - with troops levels, timetables and measures for compelling the Iraqis to cooperate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This sounds perfectly reasonable to me. And if the McCain campaign had been interested in clearly presenting their differences with Sen. Obama on Iraq, they would have rewritten it, re-submitted it, and voters would have been better informed for the effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, McCain's camp chose to score cheap political points against Obama by crying &quot;liberal bias&quot; on the part of the New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've always admired the high standards of journalism practiced by the St. Petersburg Times. How sad you've chosen to put those standards aside by running this crass piece of political theater.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greed fuels price rise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish the Times had plastered this story on the front page in bold print instead of just a small two-column item on the next page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think if more people understood what is driving up the cost of gas they would be outraged at our representatives for not passing Bill Nelson's legislation limiting oil speculation and closing various loopholes that need to be addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't so long ago that President Bush went to the Saudis and asked for more production and they informed him that production was in line with consumption and that world demand hasn't risen in more than a year. Shocking isn't it?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder national polls show people have a very low opinion of the job Congress is doing. It is a do-nothing Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As everyone now knows, the price of oil has been increasing in the past five years from about $32 per barrel to a high of $147. The Saudis, OPEC and the oil companies say that they have no control over the oil prices. President Bush says he has no &quot;magic wand&quot; to control the price of oil. That leaves the oil futures commodity traders and speculators as the only ones who actually determine the price of oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been assumed that some wanton speculation in the oil markets has been going on since the price of oil has climbed so rapidly with no signs that a shortage exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the ever-increasing price of oil is adversely affecting every aspect of our lives and economy, the Democrats proposed an amendment to curtail and limit oil futures commodity trading and speculations. It did not pass.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karadzic's changing face of evil - July 25, editorial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A double standard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radovan Karadzic has already been effectively convicted of genocide and the idea that he will receive a fair trial in front of the Islamic world at the Hague is ludicrous. If he were ever found innocent, the uproar in the Islamic world would be unbearable, especially when a barrel of Saudi crude costs more than $120.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karadzic and the Bosnian Serbs were involved in a brutal civil war where all sides did their best to destroy and defeat the enemy, yet it is only the Serbs who seem to have to answer for any war crimes that may have occurred in the Bosnian civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Muslim commander of Srebrinca and Bosnian &quot;hero&quot; Nasir Oric was recently cleared of war crimes at the Hague despite openly bragging about killing Serbian civilians. Oric used the &quot;safe haven&quot; of Srebrenica as a staging area for his troops to launch barbarous attacks into Serbian-controlled areas only to retreat back to the &quot;safe area&quot; under the protection of U.N. troops. Oric's actions made a mockery of the so called &quot;safe haven&quot; of Srebrenica and this elicited the response of Bosnian Serbs who had had enough of Oric's criminal actions at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The double standards are immense and it is no wonder the Serbs distrust the Hague.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questionable rationale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A priest of the Serbian Orthodox Church justifies Radovan Karadzic's genocide because &quot;that's part of warfare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that is the moral basis of Serbian society, no wonder all of the other Yugoslav nationalities wanted out of a Yugoslavia dominated by Serbs. Stephen Zaremba also seems to have forgotten that the warfare was started by the Serbs to prevent the freedom of other nationalities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama released his first Spanish ad in Florida Wednesday with a radio spot that hit markets in the south and central parts of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, similar to the two English-language television spots the campaign aired in the state last month, focuses on Obama's biography and mentions that he was raised without his father in his home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people have power and connections,&quot; the radio ad narrator says, according to a translation. &quot;But most of us have to make our own way through life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To listen to the ad, which is also airing in Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico, and read a full translation, including an early version that the campaign later edited, go to palmbeachpost.com/qblog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican candidate John McCain released a Spanish-language radio ad earlier this month touting his support for the Colombian Free Trade Agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates are planning campaign stops in Florida early next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain on Aug. 2 will attend a John Rich concert, which will double as a Republican Party of Florida fund-raiser, at the Marina Civic Center in Panama City. He'll be in Orlando earlier that day for an appearance at the National Urban League annual conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama will follow McCain at the Urban League conference on Aug. 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Obama's wife, Michelle, hosted a fund-raiser in Orlando and two in Miami. Today, she'll host an event in Fort Myers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Michelle Obama's Miami fund-raisers took place at the home of Abigail Pollak, a top fund-raiser for former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. That event, which cost $5,000 per person, was also being hosted by Clinton's Florida finance director, Chris Korge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hollywood stars Matt Damon, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck are scheduled to hold a fund-raiser for the Obama campaign at a Miami Beach club next week.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Great attention has been paid to potential bias against presumptive Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama due to his race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far less attention has been given to the age-related bias against Republican John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the New Yorker magazine took heat for its satirical cover of Barack Obama despite generally flattering coverage of the Obama campaign, including a story in that issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, age-related jokes about John McCain continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tonight Show produced a faux commercial on McCain that ended, &quot;John McCain: older than dirt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new scientific poll by Quinnipiac University shows that age-related factors may be a much greater handicap than race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A random group of voters nationwide were polled. The results:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- 9 percent were somewhat uncomfortable or entirely uncomfortable with having an African-American president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- 39 percent were somewhat or entirely uncomfortable with a 72-year-old president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voters also were asked if Obama's race or McCain's age make them less likely to vote for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Results:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- 5 percent said would be less likely to vote for Obama due to his race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- 20 percent said they would be less likely to vote for McCain due to his age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If health is the issue for McCain, then the lengthy primary race should have answered most of those questions, combined with the release of his medical records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policy positions, character, leadership ability and communication skills are among the factors that ought to be weighed by voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bigotry of any kind has no place in politics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Region Needs To Wake Up To Teen Sex Trafficking&quot; (Our Opinion, July 13):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for your much-needed editorial on teen sex trafficking. I would just like to add that many prostitutes are sucked in as minors through psychological abuse, physical coercion and/or drug addiction, not to mention poverty; the coercion doesn't magically disappear when they turn 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illegal prostitution means the police, traffickers and others can commit crimes against them with impunity. The problem is compounded for foreign prostitutes who don't know the laws or the language and fear deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither our complete illegalization, nor the Netherlands' complete legalization, nor Sweden's decriminalization of the supply side is a perfect solution. In order to truly help, we all need to keep an open mind and put the victims' safety first, before our distaste for prostitution. I believe the most potential for improvement lies in helping those who are at risk out of poverty and drug addiction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a former resident of Clewiston, I was so excited on Saturday knowing that The Tampa Tribune would be featuring my hometown on the front page of the Sunday edition. I thought my friends, most of whom have never heard of Clewiston, would have the opportunity to read about &quot;The Sweetest Town in America&quot; and learn all the great things about the town where I grew up. Unfortunately, that was not the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As someone who was born, raised and educated in Clewiston, I was very disappointed and embarrassed by the way the community was presented to readers. The description of locals drinking in bars at 8 a.m. is hardly indicative of the average citizen of Clewiston. I believe a more balanced picture could have been painted by interviewing professionals and upstanding citizens who live and work in the area. Instead, the most colorful characters were interviewed and quoted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, I would like to see anyone who informs him or herself about the issues and candidates register and actually vote. But last time I checked, libraries, the Internet, DHSMV offices, clerk of court offices, etc., were open to all persons. My primary complaint is that ACORN is presented as a nonpartisan group only interested in increasing voter registration. In fact, they are interested in registering Democrat Party voters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How is it that when rates for homes my size were $500 to $600 only five years ago they were making money, and now for the same home they charge $2,600 and say they are losing money?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today they pick and choose who they want to insure to make their profit margin even better. And in the past year or so the value of these homes has declined, making their losses even less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are just greedy, so say no to the rate increase.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have to admire right-wing perception management types in their ability to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. In his article, James Sherk from the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank, questions whether the economy is troubled when most people think they will be better off five years from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In five years, most expect to climb the ladder in their careers. Also, maybe they're hopeful of a change in the economy by then. Sherk says employers pay 50 percent more in health plans than eight years ago, but many, if not most employees, do also because the cost of health care has risen astronomically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sherk also complains that nobody will be able to get ahead financially if Obama succeeds in increasing the top marginal tax rate to over 50 percent, when actually Obama proposed returning to the former top rate of 39.5 percent and erasing the personal exemption for earners above $250,000. How many of us are going to agonize over that?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recession Is Real</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phil Gramm, ex-senator, now vice-chairman of UBS Investment Bank, recently commented that we should stop whining, that there is no recession, it's all in our heads. We suffer from what he called &quot;mental recession.&quot; It's obvious from these remarks that Gramm has had little contact with those of us in the middle class who go to work every day and are having a hard time keeping up with the increased prices we are now forced to pay for just about everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gramm has been a close friend for many years of John McCain and has had a loud say in the economic policies of the McCain presidential campaign. The policies of both men are an extension of GOP trickle-down economic orthodoxy which certainly benefits the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and the poor. It is this GOP economic policy that has put the federal government and ordinary American in debt up to their eyeballs. These men don't seem to recognize that the cost of the seemingly unending war in Iraq and oil prices that keep going up have added to our sense of paralysis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Sen. Mel Martinez, seeking to bolster Republican John McCain's efforts to win Hispanic voters, says McCain has &quot;stood tall&quot; on immigration reform against his own political interests while Democrat Barack Obama &quot;caved&quot; to anti-reform forces when the matter was in the U.S. Senate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martinez spoke to reporters on a conference call Friday to discuss a new McCain television spot aimed at Latino voters. The ad is running in three states with significant numbers of Hispanics: Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad isn't running in Florida, but a McCain spokesman said &quot;we'll make decisions going forward&quot; on whether to air it in the Sunshine State, where about 11 percent of voters are Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 60-second spot features a clip of McCain at a Republican debate in New Hampshire in June 2007 saying that &quot;you'll find a whole lot of Hispanic names&quot; among the dead on the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington and &quot;a whole lot of people who are of Hispanic background&quot; serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So let's from time to time remember that these are God's children. They must come into our country legally, but they have enriched our culture and our nation as every generation of immigrants before them,&quot; McCain says in the debate footage used in the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain angered many Republicans by supporting a failed immigration bill that included a temporary worker program and a path to citizenship for people who are in the country illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, McCain has emphasized beefing up border security -- drawing accusations from the Obama campaign that McCain has abandoned his earlier commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain walked away from comprehensive immigration reform during the GOP primary campaign and adopted an 'enforcement first' approach favored by the conservative wing of the Republican Party,&quot; an Obama campaign statement repeated Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martinez said border security was always part of immigration changes, but the emphasis on it now reflects the fact that &quot;not enough Americans believed that there was a seriousness of purpose&quot; about security in the original bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martinez said Obama had supported two amendments to limit the temporary worker program in the original reform measure and these would have been a &quot;poison pill&quot; to reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it counted, Senator Obama was not there but was playing to the special interests,&quot; Martinez said. He later said Obama &quot;caved&quot; to unions that opposed the temporary worker program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign pointed to a June 2007 letter Martinez wrote to Obama in which he praised the Illinois Democrat for &quot;standing firm in the face of extreme pressure&quot; and supporting the immigration bill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a bachelor, Gov. Charlie Crist has deftly navigated the complicated politics of Florida's diverse electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with Crist a rising figure on the national stage, his single status has been widely viewed as an impediment to becoming a vice presidential candidate: There hasn't been a bachelor VP in 155 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that Crist is engaged - he proposed to girlfriend Carole Rome last week - strategists say the St. Petersburg Republican is more attractive as a running mate for GOP presidential candidate John McCain, but still not a shoo-in. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he's serious about being a candidate, he needs to get married,&quot; said Republican operative Roger Stone, who worked on the presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. &quot;Politics runs on rumors and innuendo, and questions about bachelorhood persist. Getting engaged takes that off the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say that while it can be difficult for politicians to keep a spouse, having a wife or husband helps voters relate to a candidate and blunts rumors about sexuality that often follow single officials, including Crist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist said he is marrying because he is &quot;very happy and in love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said having a wife would make him a better governor but disputed the notion that marital status matters much to voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters are very smart, and I think they have a great ability to see through all of this sort of stuff that might be thrown at you during the course of a campaign,&quot; Crist said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people, God bless them, only really care about where your heart is, that you have empathy for them and that you care about them. And I do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Single male politicians, however, are vulnerable to gossip about being a homosexual or a womanizer, said several strategists, most of whom refused to be quoted for this story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the campaign is about you, you lose,&quot; said Stone, who has written that Crist should be McCain's pick. &quot;It has to be about the other guy if you're behind, and we're behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who also has not picked a running mate, is leading McCain in most national polls and in some recent surveys in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist, who was briefly married in 1979 and has been engaged four times, acknowledged that rumors that he is gay and others that he is a womanizer have followed him throughout his career. He has denied both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's bizarre, isn't it?&quot; Crist said. &quot;I don't let it affect me. I just realize that when you're in the public eye or holding office like governor of Florida, there is a scrutiny that is just part of the deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist was elected Florida education commissioner and attorney general before winning the state's top elected office in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His opponents emphasized their family backgrounds, which Crist said often seemed to imply that &quot;there's something not right about being single.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Crist's gubernatorial campaign, run the same year that U.S. Rep. Mark Foley resigned from office after sending scandalous e-mails to former male congressional pages, recognized the importance of portraying &quot;family values.&quot; Several of his television spots emphasized that he was &quot;working for our families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll continue Gov. (Jeb) Bush's pro-family agenda,&quot; Crist said in a Republican primary ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist, whose only loss in a statewide election was against then-U.S. Sen. Bob Graham in 1998, was elected as Florida's first single governor since Republican Claude Kirk in 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirk, who was married within weeks of his inauguration, also disputed the political benefits of being married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People fall in love and get engaged,&quot; Kirk said. &quot;It doesn't matter if they're running for office or driving a truck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Florida voters aren't alone in electing unmarried heads of state. There are four other single governors, including Democrat Janet Napolitano of Arizona, McCain's home state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But marital status is a bigger issue on the national level, several strategists said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No unmarried candidate has won the White House since the 1885 inauguration of Grover Cleveland, who married Frances Folsom while in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's only single vice president was William Rufus Devane King in 1853. He died from tuberculosis after just 26 days as Franklin Pierce's No. 2. Even back then, his bachelorhood helped fuel questions about his sexuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many pollsters expect McCain to win the Sunshine State, whose Republican primary voters helped slingshot him to the party's nomination this year. Florida's general election voters have picked the Democratic presidential candidate just once in the past seven election cycles: Bill Clinton in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some believe that history could persuade McCain to look for a running mate from a more competitive region of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several said another obstacle is Crist's short time as governor, which could diminish McCain's argument that Obama is too inexperienced to run the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another hurdle, strategists said, could be a perception that Crist's populist politics don't inspire the conservative base of the party. McCain has had difficulty winning over conservatives, a problem some believe could be fixed with the right vice presidential pick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign officials would not discuss potential running mates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who support Crist's spot on the ticket say his persistent campaign style and ability to relate to middle-class voters make him an ideal candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps most important is that he and McCain have formed a tight relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain phoned Crist last weekend to congratulate him on the pending nuptials. He campaigned with Crist during Florida's gubernatorial race in 2006. And Crist returned the favor in January by handing over the proverbial keys to his political machine just days before the state's important GOP presidential primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist recently spent a weekend at McCain's Sedona, Ariz., ranch along with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, two other potential vice presidential picks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that weekend was billed as a friendly barbecue, those close to Crist compared it to the get-to-know-you process Crist went though when choosing a lieutenant governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist made sure to take his now-fianc&eacute;e to McCain's ranch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unfair that single politicians are immediately suspected of being gay or being a playboy,&quot; said Dennis Baxley, executive director of the Christian Coalition of Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But being married does reassure people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Disputing Obama, Midwest and Guard officials say help during crisis was plentiful.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When deadly flooding spread through the Midwest last month, thousands of America's &quot;weekend warriors&quot; served in their traditional role of responding to domestic crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this latest natural disaster, which coincided with the start of hurricane season, raised a perennial question in post-Sept. 11 politics:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the National Guard and Reserves are fighting two foreign wars, are they ready to respond to a major terrorist attack or catastrophic natural disaster? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama ventured his answer at a press conference in Chicago last month. Asked about the national security credentials of his opponent, Republican Sen. John McCain, Obama said the war policy of McCain and President Bush have made the country less safe - not more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are weakened financially and our military is strained to the breaking point as a consequence of our incursions into Iraq,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Our National Guard, as we saw in the Midwest flooding, can't function as effectively as it could. I was talking to National Guard representatives. Fifteen of their 17 helicopters in this region were overseas during the flooding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Guard refuted Obama's claim - with facts and figures - that combat responsibilities hampered its response to the flooding. Indeed, news reports make no mention of instances where the Guard didn't &quot;function as effectively as it could.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three states affected by the flooding said they had plenty of equipment and personnel to respond to the flooding. Only one - Missouri - had most of its helicopters committed overseas. And two of the three states said most of their deployed soldiers are in Kosovo, not Iraq or Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had what we needed to get the job done,&quot; said Lt. Col. Greg Hapgood, spokesman for the Iowa National Guard, which serves the state worst hit by the flooding. &quot;If we needed more people we had more to call up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems the Midwest flooding, which killed at least 24 people and destroyed about 5-million acres of crops, was a poor example for a broader point that has been well documented: The wars have made the Guard less ready to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the sentiment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked to explain Obama's claim about problems with the guard, his campaign said just that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The exact data point on helicopters that was relayed to Sen. Obama was off, but the sentiment behind his statement was correct - that the Iraq war is overstretching our National Guard,&quot; Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said in an e-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arnold Punaro, who led an independent congressional commission on the issue of Guard and Reserves readiness, said the gist of Obama's statement is true. Since 9/11, the Guard and Reserves have undergone a fundamental shift in mission, from a chiefly domestic force that might be deployed for once-in-a-lifetime conflicts overseas to a central part of U.S. combat capability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Punaro's group found an &quot;appalling gap&quot; in readiness to respond to catastrophes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They might be able to do it a little bit longer,&quot; said Punaro, a retired Marine major general. &quot;At some point you stretch the rubber band and you break it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting it done</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission said reliance on the Guard and Reserves is the only choice if the United States is going to continue fighting wars with all-volunteer forces. It called for a sweeping overhaul of the structure and funding, which Punaro said Congress and the secretary of defense are working on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the conflicting burdens of the Reserve and Guard haven't led to a breakdown in disaster response. Mark Merritt, president of the crisis management firm James Lee Witt Associates, said that's because the National Guard always finds a way to do the mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the military way,&quot; said Merritt, whose firm has advised Louisiana's recovery from Hurricane Katrina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, for example, Florida suffered through four hurricanes in the same year that its National Guard deployment in Iraq was at an all-time high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it still had thousands of troops to call upon and agreements with neighboring states to rely on. An entire brigade from Louisiana's Guard returned from a tour in Iraq just as Hurricane Katrina passed through. Instead of having time to recoup, they went straight into the floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A significant number of National Guard soldiers and airmen are either deployed, just returned from deployment or preparing to go again. Merritt said that leaves a big unknown in the equation for disaster planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a resource that's not there,&quot; Merritt said. &quot;Not only is it not there in real time, but it's a real question mark as planning goes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our National Guard, as we saw in the Midwest flooding, can't function as effectively as it could. ... Fifteen of their 17 helicopters in this region were overseas during the flooding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His larger point about strain on the Guard is right, but his facts about the Midwest floods are just plain wrong.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain, Obama and their surrogates make a lot of noise, little of it respectful or positive.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama have talked about waging a more respectful, positive campaign for the presidency. We're still waiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even on a slow day in the typically slow Fourth of July week, the first real quiet period in this marathon campaign, on a day when the presumptive Republican nominee wasn't even on the campaign trail, the campaign war rooms work overtime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of dirt diggers and professional &quot;message&quot; shapers from both campaigns, plus countless other political groups, wage an endless battle to score points in the 24/7 news cycle, while also trying to rev up supporters and shake money loose from donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider a sampling of messages from a single, slow day, Wednesday, July 2: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7:08 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain interview on ABC's Good Morning America, from Colombia. He talks up the Colombia Free Trade Agreement and brushes off the suggestion that he has downplayed his own expertise on the economy: &quot;I said that I am stronger on national security issues because of all the time I spent in the military and others. I'm very strong on the economy. I understand it. I have a lot more experience than my opponent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7:31 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E-mail from the Obama campaign on McCain's trip: &quot;This is more of the Washington politics that has left American working families struggling to compete in a global economy by putting the lobbyists and special interests first. Just yesterday, the New York Times reported that John McCain's top adviser, Charlie Black, made $1.8-million lobbying for Colombia's leading oil exporter on energy and trade issues - including the free trade agreement that McCain is now headed to Colombia to promote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9:34 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E-mail from the Democratic National Committee: The headline reads, MCCAIN WATCH: JOHN MCCAIN VS. AMERICAN JOBS. &quot;While John McCain travels to Colombia and Mexico this week, he'll be talking about how trade creates jobs. What he won't mention is that the trade deals he has favored have created jobs overseas, not here at home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10:32 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E-mail from the Republican National Committee: &quot;In a stunning act of hypocrisy, Barack Obama has broken his pledge to accept public financing for the 2008 general election. ... There's only one way John McCain and our candidates can counter the Obama Democrats' massive haul of campaign cash ... and that's through your generous support of the RNC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11:10 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DNC conference call with reporters: On the line are DNC vice chairwoman Linda Chavez-Thompson and Mark Levinson, chief economist for the labor group Unite Here. &quot;We have seen that now, from every indication, Sen. McCain is going to follow George Bush's failed economic policies. We can't afford that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:05 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain news conference in Cartagena, Colombia: He talks about drug interdiction, the benefits of lifting tariffs on Colombian exports, and denies the recently publicized recollection of U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., that on a 1987 diplomatic trip to Nicaragua, McCain had manhandled an associate of President Daniel Ortega.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:11 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conference call with reporters by the Service Employees International Union: The group touts its $85-million voter mobilization effort in key states. &quot;We want to make it really clear to voters if they want to vote for John McCain, it's as good as voting for George Bush,&quot; said secretary-treasurer Anna Burger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:46 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E-mail from American Political Action Committee (AmeriPAC): The group bashes Obama on gun rights: &quot;The gun-control views of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama are an 'obamination' of the Second Amendment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1:05 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign conference call featuring Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, on Obama and Iraq: He says he's &quot;concerned&quot; that a top surrogate for the Obama campaign said Obama hasn't changed his views on the need to leave Iraq. &quot;I just believe that raises serious questions as to the sensibility of that position given what's going on in Iraq right now - what's going on on the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1:20 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama speech in Colorado Springs, Colo., promoting national service: &quot;This will not be a call issued in one speech or one program - this will be a central cause of my presidency. We will ask Americans to serve. We will create new opportunities for Americans to serve. And we will direct that service to our most pressing national challenges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1:40 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E-mail from Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor: &quot;Instead of questioning Barack Obama's consistent call for a new direction in Iraq and Afghanistan, John McCain should explain why he is offering nothing more than four more years of a failed foreign policy that has ... failed to bring Osama bin Laden to justice for over six years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2:08 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign conference call: On the line to discuss Latin America policy is former Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard and Latin America expert Dan Restrepo: They dismiss McCain's Colombia trip. &quot;It is a photo op,&quot; one says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2:18 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E-mail from McCain campaign announcing new Spanish language radio ad in Florida: &quot;This is Tony Villamil speaking, ex-director of Tourism, Commerce and Economic Affairs of Florida. ... Remember who stands for prosperity in Florida, our country and our hemisphere. His name is John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2:24 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DNC news release responding to McCain's ABC interview earlier in the day: The DNC disputes McCain's claim that he never said he wasn't an expert on the economy, providing a list of YouTube video clips of McCain saying just that. &quot;Apparently John McCain's campaign thinks the voters haven't already noticed that he was right when he admitted he doesn't understand the economy as well as he should.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3:43 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E-mail from the liberal group MoveOn.org: &quot;It's become pretty clear that pundits love John McCain. 'We're his base,' MSNBC host Chris Matthews famously said. So if you're looking for some, er, straight talk on Sen. McCain - where's a person to go? That's why we're launching McCain Watch - a zippy e-mail with the presidential news you most need to know (but won't hear elsewhere) about Sen. McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4:15 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RNC conference call:It declares that Obama is out of step with voters in North Dakota, where Obama was to campaign the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign news release: The &quot;in case you missed it&quot; release touts an Associated Press story headlined &quot;Bipartisanship Marks McCain's Senate Tenure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4:42 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Jewish Democratic Council news release: The &quot;fact sheet&quot; charges that McCain has &quot;flip-flopped&quot; on issues ranging from offshore drilling to Social Security privatization to abortion rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most reasonable people have come to view Fox News Channel's &quot;fair and balanced&quot; motto as little more than a promotional claim that can't be backed up by fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The network, top-heavy with conservative pundits, has always leaned to the right. And that's just fine with the 2 million-plus loyal fans who know what they're getting when they tune in. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the past few months, as Sen. Barack Obama began to secure the Democratic nomination, Fox News threw out even the appearance of &quot;fair and balanced&quot; coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm just a casual viewer of the all-news networks, and I seldom watch Fox News. But after getting a few e-mails from readers who think the network has gone off the deep end with Obama bashing, I started taking a closer look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is totally unscientific but I have noticed that the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, Sen. John McCain, gets headlines such as &quot;McCain Picks Up Endorsement Of 'ChiPs' Star Erik Estrada&quot; while Obama gets headlines such as &quot;Obama Would Open The Door To Illegal Immigrants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News recently explained a headline graphic that called Obama's wife, Michelle, &quot;Obama's baby mama&quot; as &quot;poor judgment&quot; by a producer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late May, Fox News contributor Liz Trotta apologized for joking that Obama should be assassinated, along with Osama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, conservative talk show host Bill O'Reilly apologized for saying that he &quot;didn't want to go on a lynching party against Michelle Obama unless there's hard evidence&quot; that she really wasn't proud of her country until her husband made this bid for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, Fox anchor E.D. Hill lost her afternoon show after asking on-air if a knuckle-tap gesture between the Obamas was a &quot;terrorist fist jab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A fist bump? A pound? A terrorist fist jab? The gesture everyone seems to interpret differently,&quot; said Hill, who did a whole segment on Obama body language, suggesting it was more than just an affectionate celebration on the night he claimed the Democratic nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News Channel has more commentary than news - and most of the news is presented with attitude - so it's hard to tell when spinning stops and the reporting begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I caught one installment of Fox News' new afternoon show, &quot;Just In ? With Laura Ingraham,&quot; which opened with a favorable preview of a McCain&nbsp;commercial. Set to James Bond-style theme music, the ad calls Obama a &quot;Dr. No&quot; because supposedly he is opposed to offshore oil drilling, electric cars, a gas tax holiday and &quot;clean, safe nuclear energy.&quot; A Republican strategist praised the commercial. But there was no &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;balanced&quot; response from the Obama camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ingraham then launched into a rant about a Rolling Stone magazine interview in which Obama revealed his &quot;eclectic tastes&quot; in music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his iPod are about 30 Bob Dylan songs including &quot;Maggie's Farm,&quot; which he says is a favorite. He's also got Jay-Z , Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, Sheryl Crow and rapper Ludacris, whom he calls a &quot;talented genius.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ingraham zeroed in on Ludacris, suggesting that Obama's faint praise for a rapper who sings vulgar misogynistic lyrics shows questionable moral character. She showed a bleeped-out list of Ludacris' raunchy song titles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, we don't know what's on McCain's iPod, or if he even has one. But I have trouble imagining Obama listening to something like &quot;Hoes in My Room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem for Fox News Channel is that Ingraham's questioning of Obama's stand on rap, or lack of a stand, might be worthy of comment, but the air there has been poisoned by what appears to be an anti-Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the presidential candidates, there was one &quot;must'' stop this month - the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Sen. John McCain was the first to speak, talking up his recent visit to Jerusalem with Senate colleague Joe Lieberman and urging an increase in military aid for Israel. Next came Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, who recalled learning about the Holocaust from a Jewish camp counselor. Obama was followed by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who noted that she represents &quot;one of the largest Jewish constituencies in the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for their appearances was simple - the Jewish vote is especially strong in key states like New York and Florida. And as every member of Congress knows, there is no more powerful pro-Israel lobby than AIPAC. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too powerful, some say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics have long charged that AIPAC's political clout and support of hawkish U.S. and Israeli policies have impeded efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East. So a new organization has emerged as a potential counterweight - J Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing most misunderstood in the political arena is that there isn't only one view when it comes to Israel in the American Jewish community,'' says Jeremy Ben-Ami, J Street's executive director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J Street gets its name from the fact that there is no &quot;J Street'' in Washington, reflecting the premise that liberal, dovish views are largely absent from discussions of Mideast policy. Billing itself as the political arm of the pro-peace movement, J Street vows to &quot;advocate forcefully'' in support of diplomatic solutions over military ones and dialogue over confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its first two months, J Street has drawn &quot;tremendous response,'' Ben-Ami says, with 30,000 supporters signing up online. Its advisory council includes rabbis, CEOs and several Nobel laureates. It already has raised $1.1-million toward its operating costs of $1.5-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization is careful to avoid attacking AIPAC by name. However, in a full-page ad in the New York Times last week, J Street chastised &quot;established'' pro-Israel organizations for their &quot;deafening silence'' on Israel's new cease-fire with Hamas and the resumption of peace talks with Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These efforts may or may not succeed,'' the ad says. &quot;But they are designed to enhance Israel's security, the region's stability and to bring peace closer. And they deserve our support.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AIPAC has had no official comment on J Street. But an AIPAC spokesperson directed me to a recent article in the New Republic that paints J Street as a left-wing organization out of touch with mainstream views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's true that American Jews are overwhelmingly liberal on most issues,'' the article says. &quot;The problem for J Street is that Israel simply isn't one of those issues.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the New Republic points out, a poll by the American Jewish Committee found that 55 percent of American Jews think Israel and its Arab neighbors will never be able to live in peace, and that 82 percent think the Arabs' goal is not the return of occupied territories but the destruction of Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the same poll also shows American Jews tend to be dovish and are troubled by current U.S. foreign policy. Two-thirds, for example, think the United States should not have invaded Iraq - a move that strengthened Iran and thus undermined Israel's security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J Street, which has a political action committee, will stay out of the presidential race but plans to do &quot;really serious&quot; fundraising for about a dozen congressional candidates, Ben-Ami says. AIPAC doesn't contribute to campaigns, though many of its 100,000 members donate to pro-Israel PACs that have given $1.85-million so far to 2008 federal candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;AIPAC has done a lot of very important things to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship,'' Ben-Ami says. &quot;What J Street was started to do was fill a vacuum, and that vacuum is that nobody has been a strong political voice for assertive American diplomacy in the Middle East to resolve conflict.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The GOP candidate's reputation for breaking from his party is earned, if a bit overstated.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a word so closely associated with Sen. John McCain that his critics dryly joke it has become part of his name, a term so ubiquitous that McCain has a stock answer whenever he's asked about the reputation that both lifts and dogs him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would prefer to describe myself as a great American,&quot; he says, deadpan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when the Republican president's approval ratings are in the cellar, it's helpful for the Republican vying to replace him to have a certain reputation: maverick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain's 21-year record in the U.S. Senate, as well as many of the positions he has taken as a candidate, shows he is a solid conservative who generally supports the Republican orthodoxy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of ideology and matters of peace and prosperity - taxes, health care, economic policy, the war in Iraq - McCain and President Bush are nearly indistinguishable, favoring the free market over government intervention, cutting taxes for the rich and corporations, and preferring pressure or estrangement over negotiation with America's enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the frequent assertion by the Democratic Party and its standard bearer, Sen. Barack Obama, that a vote for McCain is a vote for a &quot;third Bush term&quot; is an overstatement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has departed from his party and his president on many high-profile issues, from embryonic stem cell research to combating global warming to sending more U.S. troops to Iraq at a time when his colleagues were loath to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also has been far more willing than Bush to work with Democrats to produce legislation - often to his party's irritation. In that way, McCain's maverick reputation is as much a product of style as of substance. He is widely known for being rough on those who disagree with him, no matter their party affiliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when you ask a Republican in House leadership if McCain's recent declaration in support of offshore drilling was an attempt to cozy up to his GOP colleagues, Rep. Adam Putnam of Bartow says no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There aren't that many issues where we aren't in synch,&quot; Putnam said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the nonpartisan Congressional Quarterly (a sister publication of the Times), McCain has voted with his party about 90 percent of the time over the past five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Energy, taxes, health care - he's right in line with the general Republican philosophy there,&quot; said Patrick Kennedy, chairman of the political science department at Arizona State University, who has followed McCain since he joined the Senate in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has voted to extend Bush's signature tax cuts that offer the deepest cuts for the wealthy, and he recently proposed more of his own. He has consistently backed private savings accounts for Social Security, similar to Bush. Like Bush, he has pledged to stay the course in Iraq. And like Bush, he has opposed significant government action in the housing crisis, preferring to let the market work itself out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when McCain splits with his conservative colleagues, he isn't always gentle about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, there's a difference between voting for campaign finance reform and taking it upon your shoulders as the issue you're going to dedicate five years of your political life to,&quot; said Nachama Soloveichik, head of communications for the conservative Club for Growth, which advocates low taxes and free-market policies. &quot;McCain has definitely put himself out there and ticked off a lot of people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soloveichik was referring to the campaign finance reform bill of 2002, authored by McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., which limited third-party political advertising and contributions. To say many conservatives hate it would be an understatement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain poured salt in the wound when he defended the bill on The Don Imus Show in April 2006, essentially saying the bill's opponents prefer corruption. &quot;I know that money corrupts. ... I would rather have a clean government than one where, 'First Amendment rights' are being respected, that has become corrupt. If I had my choice, I'd rather have the clean government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2003, at a time when congressional Republicans were marching in lockstep with Bush on Iraq, McCain broke ranks by openly criticizing then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfield, and Bush indirectly - a sharp message on the eve of Bush's re-election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As Lincoln and Truman demonstrated, American presidents cannot always leave decisions on matters of supreme national interest to their subordinates,&quot; he told the Council on Foreign Relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the list of senior Republicans he has insulted, and cursed, in the Senate includes Thad Cochran of Mississippi, the former Appropriations Committee chairman; Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the former Budget Committee chairman whom McCain reportedly called an &quot;a--hole&quot;; and John Cornyn of Texas, to whom McCain reportedly said &quot;f--- you&quot; during an argument over immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2003, before the Bush administration acknowledged global warming exists, McCain took to the Senate floor to advocate limiting pollution to slow climate change. He and Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent who was a Democrat at the time, proposed a bill to cap carbon emissions and allow pollution credits to be traded on the open market, which many conservatives hate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he opposes abortion rights, McCain has been a vocal proponent of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, twice voting for bills Bush vetoed. A former prisoner of war in Vietnam, he broke with the Bush administration over the treatment of detainees from Iraq and Afghanistan, and called for closing the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. That's not popular with the right, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2003, he joined Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., in authoring a bill to create a Patients' Bill of Rights, which congressional Republicans killed after a big fight. In 2005, he was one of the so-called Gang of 14, a bipartisan group of senators that struck a deal on the confirmation of Bush's appointees to federal appeals courts to preserve Senate rules permitting the minority to filibuster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the compromise, some of the president's picks would be confirmed, and others wouldn't. Considering that Republicans ran the Senate at the time, many conservatives are still peeved about that one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And last year, even though he needed to court the GOP base to win the presidential nomination, he again teamed up with Kennedy to push a bill creating a path to legal status for millions of illegal immigrants. Bush supported it, but rank-and-file Republicans really hated it. The bill tanked and his candidacy almost did, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has this, 'This is what I'm going to do, and if you don't like it, screw you' attitude,&quot; Soloveichik said. &quot;For conservatives, when he's standing next to Ted Kennedy and he says that, it's annoying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first mention the Times could find of McCain as a maverick was in 1989, in a story about the American Conservative Union's ratings for the Arizona congressional delegation. McCain, a first-term senator, scored 80 out of 100. Dan Casey, then the director of the ACU, said, &quot;He's a good conservative, but something of a maverick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 20 years later, McCain's reputation as a maverick poses both opportunity and risks. Polls show Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of President Bush's performance, and Republican prospects in key congressional races look poor. In times like these, it's helpful to be seen as someone who goes his own way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet as the Republican standard-bearer, McCain can't afford to alienate the 30 percent of Americans who think Bush is doing swell. Those are the party faithful whose energy and enthusiasm have buoyed Republicans in the past two presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even McCain seems conflicted at times. As he traveled the country this month, cheering Republicans with his newfound advocacy for offshore drilling, McCain's campaign was running a TV ad showing grim pictures of traffic jams and dirty smokestacks and showing off newspaper headlines such as, &quot;McCain climate views clash with GOP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming . . . five years ago,&quot; the narrator in the TV ad says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a twist, McCain's friends in the Senate and the Democrats trying to disabuse voters of the notion that McCain is a maverick agree on one thing: He's no moderate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he's a conservative, and he's a conservative who has a heart, and in that respect, I relate,&quot; said Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla., a close friend and supporter who backed the immigration bill. &quot;He is willing to take positions that some might view as more moderate at times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has campaigned with McCain, said the maverick label has stuck because &quot;(reporters) don't write about the 90 percent agreement, you write about the 10 percent when a senator goes a different path from his party. That's what makes news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you look at these issues, there's a theme here,&quot; Graham added. &quot;They're all hard, and they will require bipartisanship to solve, and they deal with a problem the country is facing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain - The sometime maverick</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arizona Sen. John McCain, the Republican candidate for president, has earned a reputation as a political maverick over two decades in the Senate for his support of policies that run counter to Republican orthodoxy. But he also is a fiscal and social conservative who generally supports his party's policies, and his views don't vary widely from President Bush's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where he diverges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign finance reform: Conservatives are still sore at him for the 2002 McCain-Feingold Act, a bill that limits the role of third-party groups in elections. Critics say it infringes on the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embryonic stem cell research: McCain has long supported federal funding for this research, which many scientists believe is a key step toward regenerative medicine. Bush has twice vetoed stem cell funding bills that McCain supported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration: In 2007, he pushed a bill that would have provided a route to legal status for the nation's estimated 12-million illegal immigrants. Conservatives called it a reward for breaking the law. President Bush was on his side on this one, but the backlash nearly sank McCain's candidacy last summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global warming: Back in 2003, before the Bush administration acknowledged global warming, McCain called for action to cut greenhouse gases. He and Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent who was a Democrat then, have introduced legislation to cap emissions and trade carbon credits on the open market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where he's in line</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax breaks: McCain has called for extending Bush's tax cuts, even though he opposed them in 2003 on grounds that the nation was at war and couldn't afford them. As a candidate for president, he has proposed his own slate of tax cuts that, like Bush's, favor the wealthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Supreme Court: On the campaign trail, he promises to appoint conservative justices in the same vein as Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito Jr., whom Bush appointed. Both oppose legal abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraq: Like Bush and Republican leaders in Congress, McCain favors keeping troops in Iraq and will not support any timeline for withdrawal. He has been a stalwart on this issue, diverging from the Bush administration only to argue back in 2003 that the United States needed more troops in Iraq, not fewer. The president agreed three years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomacy: Like the Bush administration, McCain says he would not negotiate with leaders of North Korea, Iran, Syria or Cuba until they drop stances deemed harmful by the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Security: McCain favors adding private savings accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy: McCain recently joined his Republican colleagues in Congress and the president in calling for an end to the federal ban on offshore oil and gas drilling. He said states should decide whether to allow drilling off their shores.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How bad is it for John McCain? Some of his supporters keep suggesting he would have a better shot at the White House if he promised to serve only one term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cue the old joke about the contest in which the first prize is a week in Philadelphia, and the second prize is two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this is no joke. McCain has flirted with the idea of being a voluntary, one-term wonder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January, a woman at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire asked if he had the stamina for eight years in the White House. McCain, who at 72 would be the oldest president at the start of a first term, replied, according to The Boston Globe, &quot;If I said I was running for eight years, I'm not sure that would be a vote-getter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When reporters asked him later, he dismissed the one-term idea. But it turns out he had weighed making the pledge when he launched his White House bid last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc Ambinder, who blogs on politics at theatlantic.com, reported June 2 that an early draft of McCain's announcement speech contained a one-term pledge. McCain decided against it after hearing the reasons it wouldn't work, among them that it diminishes presidential clout and instantly raises the curtains on the next presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the idea keeps coming back. Ramesh Ponnuru of the National Review has urged McCain to make the pledge, as have others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a gathering of rural advocates in Washington June 16, Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, speaking as McCain's surrogate, said, &quot;He's probably even considering announcing that he would serve only one term, as a way of pushing the agenda on a bipartisan basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brownback seemed to distance himself from his own statement afterwards, though, saying he had heard McCain say it months ago. Brownback said this is not the right time anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, what if McCain took the pledge in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul in September? It would take age off the table once and for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could even mollify those Republicans who think McCain is insufficiently conservative. They could hold their noses and vote for him as the lesser of two evils, knowing he was on his way out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For McCain, saying he wanted only one term would free him from the endless tacking to the right. He could stop pandering on issues that matter to him - such as immigration and tax cuts. He could go back to his maverick self, which appeals to independent voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain needs something to give his campaign a lift. Some polls show Barack Obama with a comfortable, double-digit lead nationally over McCain among registered voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In four-person matchups - with McCain, Independent Ralph Nader and Libertarian Bob Barr - Obama fares even better. The McCain campaign was reduced to disputing the methodology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four state polls conducted by Quinnipiac University with The Wall Street Journal and washingtonpost.com and released Thursday found Obama ahead in battlegrounds of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has trounced McCain in fundraising, raking in $287.4 million to McCain's $119.6 million. Obama is so flush he turned down about $85 million in federal matching funds, and he's so golden that his flip-flop from previously saying he would take matching funds was a nonissue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Republican senator - Gordon Smith of Oregon - is running a re-election campaign ad touting his ability to work with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this mean the presidential race is over? No. It means Obama had a good June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Peter A. Brown of the Quinnipiac poll said last week, &quot;Senator Obama should not be picking out the drapes for the Oval Office just yet. His lead nationally, and double digits in some states, is not hugely different from where Sen. John Kerry stood four years ago at this point in the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We still have four months until Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If McCain were to take the one-term pledge, he could argue that he's the candidate for change. It would be a way for the white male presidential candidate to make history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody has ever run for the White House promising to serve just one term.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whenever a cell phone chirps or blasts from the recesses of a pocket or purse, the ring tone can shed a little light on the owner's pop culture sensibility and political leanings. Thanks to Internet-ready phones, there are hundreds of pop songs, sound effects, buzzes and beeps to choose and assign to specific callers. Think of them as virtual bread crumbs toward someone's psyche, however tenuous that connection may be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times-Union asked several notable figures in the Jacksonville area about their cell phone ring tones. Analyze away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CELEBRITY RING TONE MATCHUP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLUES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 AL LETSON, playwright and artist: He chose the political speech for its uplifting message: &quot;I love America, but sometimes I get down on all the politics of it all,&quot; he said. For performing artist friends, his phone plays Lupe Fiasco's Superstar, and &quot;Danger, Will Robinson, danger!&quot; plays when it's someone Letson wants to avoid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 JOHN PEYTON, mayor of Jacksonville: He says it's the most discreet option for the mayor, who's constantly ducking in and out of meetings and public appearances, according to spokeswoman Susie Wiles. Sheriff John Rutherford, Duval County Superintendent Ed Pratt-Dannals and blogger Joey March do likewise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 RUDOLPH McKISSICK JR., pastor of Bethel Baptist Institutional Church: His general ring tone is straight off his church choir's CD. When his wife calls, the gospel tune He Is Able rings. When his daughter calls, it's Independent, by Webbie featuring Lil' Phat &amp; Lil' Boosie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4 REGGIE WILLIAMS, Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver: He changes his ring tone every few weeks and is always gunning for the hottest, trendiest song available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5 DIANE COHAN, makeup artist for local political and athletic campaigns: &quot;It's the song they play at weddings. Probably because we're Jewish,&quot; she said. She does makeup for Mayor John Peyton, John McCain's televised commercials, as well as monster movie cosmetics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6 FABIO MECHETTI, conductor of the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra: &quot;I detest phones, so when they ring, I want them to make the least amount of noise possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7 WYLLIE HODGES, executive director of First Coast Crime Stoppers: &quot;I've always loved that movie, I've always loved Clint Eastwood. Those types of Westerns are my favorites.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8 PETER BIEGEL, executive director of student success at Florida Community College at Jacksonville: The phone once went off right before a therapy session at his chiropractor's office. The concerned chiropractor burst into the room to see what the emergency was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9 JOHNNY VAN ZANT, singer for Lynyrd Skynyrd: &quot;I know it well, 'cause nobody else uses them anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back at the height of her surreal U.S. Senate campaign, we were thrilled at Katherine Harris' talk about writing a juicy tell-all book. Just think of all the wonderfully unpleasant things she might have to say about the Bushes, the Democrats, the reporters and the campaign professionals she was sure to cast as her persecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alas, the former Republican congresswoman's book never appeared (kinda like the $10-million of her own money she promised to spend on her campaign against Bill Nelson). But fans of political gossip may get a consolation prize: a juicy tell-all book by her former campaign manager, Jamie Miller. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miller lasted six months on the Harris campaign - longer than any of her other three campaign managers, and he is shopping around a book about his former boss whom he said once assured him - when he tried to persuade her to drop out and pursue a punditry career - that God intended her to be in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I try to do with the book is describe the conflict between the persona of Katherine Harris and the person,&quot; Miller told Buzz. There is Harris, the thoroughly charming Steel Magnolia; and there is the other Harris that Miller said is more like the Incredible Hulk on a particularly bad day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are likely to be stories about Harris eviscerating her chief elections deputy Clay Roberts on election night after Jeb Bush woke up Harris in the wee hours to find out what the heck was going on with the Florida vote tally. Or what happened to the pitiful staffers who botched her constant Starbucks orders (always Triple Venti, no fat, no foam, extra hot, with pink sugar).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miller said lots of former Harris staffers are likely to cooperate with the half-finished book. Former senior adviser Ed Rollins, who once likened his experience to &quot;being in insanity camp,&quot; may pen the book jacket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What will Harris think about it? &quot;I don't know what she'll think,&quot; Miller said. &quot;I had trouble thinking what she thought when I was working for her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris did not reply to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One mayor at bat for Toytown for Rays</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Count Clearwater Mayor Frank Hibbard among those skeptical about the Rays' waterfront ball park proposal. In fact, Hibbard doesn't even like the current location off downtown St. Petersburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Carillon, the Toytown area, is a much better place for north Pinellas and Pasco and Hillsborough and still is extremely convenient and keeps the team in St. Petersburg,&quot; Hibbard said in a Political Connections interview airing today on Bay News 9, &quot;I want to keep the Devil Rays. They are and can be an economic engine for us. ... but I don't want to necessarily see our bed tax obligated for decades to come.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hibbard, a Republican, also weighed in on Scientologists in his city, the prospect of his running for C.W. Bill Young's congressional seat, his opposition to the &quot;tax swap&quot; initiative and the need for regional mass transit. Check it out at 11 a.m. and 8:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A final skirmish on the state delegate front</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just when you thought all the drama was over. On the eve of Florida Democrats' big party-unity fundraiser, the delegate debacle reared its ugly head one last time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama wanted to reward his Florida loyalists and send a few to the convention, which meant others would lose their spots. This spurred a string of tart and publicly released e-mails between DNC wag Jon Ausman and Obama's top Florida moneyman, Kirk Wagar. Wagar was caught smacking Sen. Bill Nelson, Florida Democratic chief Leonard Joseph and other establishment types, and slapping Ausman around with an f-bomb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegate switcheroo was approved Saturday morning without too much whining, according to those at the meeting. Seven lost their spots, including Marilyn Cappiello of Tampa. But other locals including Rep. Betty Reed and Frank Sanchez, both of Tampa, are now Denver-bound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain in Miami ad: Cuba must move first</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain kicked off the general election advertising war in Florida with a Spanish-language radio ad in Miami: &quot;While others support dialogue with Raul Castro, John McCain believes we should support the valiant men and women who struggle for a free Cuba. Instead of initiating a relationship with Raul Castro, John McCain wants to assure that all political prisoners first be released. As someone who endured cruel conditions in Vietnamese prisons, John McCain knows that liberty in Cuba won't come by making concessions to the dictatorship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist's plate full with Florida, McCain says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did McCain hint in the following little-noticed remark he thinks our governor should stick around Florida awhile longer? &quot;Well I think some of that would be Charlie's choice in respect that he's been governor for not a long period of time and I think he has a lot of work to do here,&quot; McCain said when asked in South Florida about a potential role for Crist in a McCain administration. &quot;Whatever role, I think he's going to be a leader in our Republican Party for a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Why do the media feel they have to explain his every move, as if he came from a foreign culture?<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider it the fist pound explained 'round the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Barack Obama exchanged a playful touching of fists with wife Michelle before going on to announce his historic ascension as the Democratic party's first non-white nominee for president, he did much more than prove he's hipper than most of the political class in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also inspired an explosion of mindless explanatory news stories. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevermind that athletes and black folks have been giving each other &quot;dap&quot; by touching fists for something like 30 years. Two characters even exchanged the greeting in Winona Ryder's seminal movie about angsty white teens, Heathers - a film released nearly 20 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter. When Obama the phenom unleashes a bit of pop culture flash to the masses, the political media can't help but explain it to us; even when it's obvious we already know what it means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Time magazine gave us &quot;A Brief History of the Fist Bump,&quot; nearly 600 words on the origin of the move just stiff enough to leave readers uncertain if they were joking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun, Washington Post and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also weighed in (though I loved writer Ta-Nehisi Coates' observation to the Post that, for bringing such black-isms to the political world, &quot;Barack is like Black Folks 2.0.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cable news channels discussed the bump for days, with U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kay Bailey Hutchison painfully re-creating it on CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, of course, Fox News Channel anchor E.D. Hill stepped in it big-time when she seemed to suggest one interpretation of the move could be as a &quot;terrorist fist jab.&quot; She has since, mercifully, apologized (Hill also lost her 11 a.m. show Tuesday in a move Fox News says is not related to the comment.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, to prevent further confusion, perhaps we should go over a few more nuggets from black culture that Obama might reference as the campaign progresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brother&quot;- When black folks use this term to refer to another black person, they are not necessarily talking blood relations. The likely reference: a shorthand for the old-school term of affection, &quot;Soul Brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Diss&quot; - Shorthand for &quot;disrespect,&quot; this is a term used when someone insults another, disparaging their status. So you might say John McCain's recent words about the Democratic candidate's lack of foreign policy experience were a serious diss to Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hand clinch leading into a one-armed embrace - This is a move light years beyond the &quot;closed-fisted high five&quot; Obama brought to the nation June 3. Here, the clincher executes an open-ended hand clasp with his subject, then pulls the person in for a one-handed hug. For extra cool points, make your fingers snap with the subject as you end the hand clasp. Novices should not attempt this without a third party spotting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whassup&quot; - Black folks stopped using this greeting when its widespread use in a Budweiser Super Bowl commercial made every Caucasian with ESPN sling it at their acquaintances of color. Still, if anyone can make its use cool again, Obama's the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In seriousness, his use of the dap seems much more about his generation - blending ethnic cultures in a way some academics call &quot;post racial.&quot; So it's odd that an action that has been mainstream for so long suddenly takes on an exotic quality because Obama does it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is, it's just a cool handshake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope journalists learn to save the thumb-sucking explainer pieces for when they're really needed. Because Obama's appeal isn't in the exotic way he brings black culture to politics, but in the seemingly effortless way he navigates black and white culture, suggesting a comfortable common ground.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential contender John McCain will return to Florida this week, and Democratic challenger Barack Obama will follow later this month as both candidates sharpen their focus on the bellwether state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who aired a Spanish-language radio ad in Miami on Tuesday, was scheduled to make his 19th trip to Florida on Friday for &quot;private meetings&quot; in Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His trip would coincide with the semiannual spring meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in Orlando. The bishops group is scheduled to vote Friday on a resolution to oppose embryonic stem cell research. McCain has supported federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign plans a trip to Jacksonville on June 20 for an event related to his two-week tour on economic issues. Obama will also hold a fund-raiser, being planned by former gubernatorial candidate Steve Pajcic, attorney Wayne Hogan and investor Bobby Stein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is also scheduled to travel to Miami on June 21 to address the annual meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain on Monday aired a radio ad aimed at Miami's Cuban-American voters. The commercial doesn't mention Obama but criticizes the Democrat's willingness to meet with leaders of Cuba and Venezuela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad features Roberto Martin Perez, a former political prisoner in Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rather than resume relations with Raul Castro, John McCain wants first and foremost for all political prisoners to be released,&quot; Martin Perez says in the ad. &quot;As someone who has survived the harsh conditions of the Vietnamese prisons, John McCain knows that freedom in Cuba won't be achieved with concessions to dictatorships.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, May 26 in a Web ad&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We checked with the Defense Department to see how many noncitizens are serving in the U.S. military, and if Sen. John McCain was accurate that there are thousands serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. The short answer is that McCain is right. As of Feb. 29, there were 20,328 noncitizens on active duty in the military (about 1.5 percent of the entire active military), according to a report provided by the Pentagon. Of those, 4,112 were serving in Iraq or Afghanistan, or in support of those operations elsewhere. There were another 2,236 whose citizenship was &quot;unknown.&quot; These are legal residents with green cards who have not yet become naturalized citizens. There are citizenship incentives for those who enlist. All immigrants who serve honorably in the military during wartime are eligible to file for immediate citizenship under special wartime provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. An analysis of the Pentagon report by PolitiFact determined that about a quarter of the &quot;green card&quot; soldiers are originally from Spanish-speaking countries. In addition, there are 10,533 naturalized citizens in the military who were born in Spanish-speaking countries. The thousands of noncitizens serving is one of the military's little-known facts. But not to McCain. Robert Farley, Times staff writer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her senior thesis doesn't say that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's wife wrote a paper in college that said America was a nation founded on &quot;crime and hatred&quot; and that whites in America are &quot;ineradicably racist.&quot; From a chain e-mail</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that Michelle Obama, then Michelle Robinson, attended Princeton and wrote a thesis titled &quot;Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.&quot; In Obama's thesis, she sought to quantify how the attitudes of black Princeton alumni changed after graduation in regard to race relations and social change. To document the change in attitudes, Obama devised an 18-question survey and mailed it to black alumni. Her thesis is a discussion of her methodology and an analysis of the results. It contains a limited amount of personal opinion in the introduction. The thesis did not say that the United States was founded on &quot;crime and hatred&quot; and that whites in America are &quot;ineradicably racist.&quot; This appears to be a complete fabrication. The thesis is available on the Internet; the politics news site Politico reported on it in February and posted a copy it had obtained from Princeton. We downloaded a copy, which appears to be complete with no numbered pages missing. We read it, but we did not find the phrases the e-mail describes. We took the additional step of scanning the document through optical character recognition software so we could search its text electronically. An automated search did not find the words &quot;crime,&quot; &quot;hatred,&quot; &quot;hate,&quot; &quot;ineradicably&quot; or &quot;racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By BILLY HOUSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tampa Tribune</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The Barack Obama campaign and Florida Democrats on Thursday attacked Sen. John McCain's opposition to a national insurance catastrophic fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They sought not only to underscore the difference between the candidates on a key Florida issue, but to tie McCain to George Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state Democratic Party unveiled an online ad with footage of McCain boasting in a February speech to a conservative group that he campaigned in Florida against a &quot;cat fund.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the Obama campaign in a news release questioned whether McCain understands the issue. McCain &quot;has made clear that he is much more interested in standing with George Bush than getting the facts right or doing what's right,&quot; said a news release from Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats seized on the opportunity at a time when McCain is seeking to emphasize his differences with the unpopular president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain sought distance from the administration in a speech in New Orleans on Tuesday, and will do so again by emphasizing his environmental credentials in an appearance in the Everglades today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush has said he would veto a national catastrophe fund, which would provide backup for insurance companies facing huge claims after disasters including hurricanes and earthquakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Democrats also brought Gov. Charlie Crist, McCain's top Florida backer, into the picture. Crist has been discussed as a possible McCain running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic state House leader Dan Gelber told reporters he is &quot;dumbfounded&quot; that Crist has not done more to persuade the Arizona senator to support a cat fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist Hopes To Persuade McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds fired back, saying Obama &quot;has chosen to use natural catastrophes to launch political attacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said McCain opposes a cat fund &quot;not because he doesn't have serious concerns about the cost of insurance in Florida, but because it ignores the need for private insurance reforms to broaden markets and protections against the cherry-picking of individual states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that Crist was aware of McCain's stand before the state's Jan. 29 primary. McCain won that primary, despite his anti-cat fund stance, with help from a key endorsement by Crist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist said at the time that he would seek to persuade McCain on the issue, and that he considered McCain trustworthy and honest on that and other issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist has identified the program as one of his top federal priorities. Asked this year about his efforts to sway McCain, he told The Tampa Tribune, &quot;It takes time to do good things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crist's office didn't give any further response Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a February speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, McCain noted that he opposed the idea while campaigning in Florida, and that he also campaigned in Iowa against agriculture subsidies and in New Hampshire &quot;against big government-mandated health care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said that shows he'll stick to his conservative convictions on smaller government, fiscal discipline and low taxes, despite political risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Footage of that speech found its way into the Democrats' online advertisement at www.HurricaneMcCain.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama Supports National Fund</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain opposed a cat fund bill that passed in the House, sponsored by Democratic freshman Florida Reps. Ron Klein of Boca Raton and Tim Mahoney of Palm Beach Gardens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, meanwhile, has strongly supported a national catastrophe fund since before Florida's primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Jan. 17 letter to Klein, who questioned the presidential candidates on their position, Obama said he enthusiastically supports the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said stabilizing &quot;the catastrophe insurance market by expanding the capacity of the private insurance market to cover a natural disaster&quot; would help states manage risk and stabilize premiums for homeowners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will commit to supporting this legislation as president&quot; if necessary, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Obama signed on as a co-sponsor to a cat fund amendment by Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Democratic Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana were also co-sponsors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gelber and Klein joined Obama campaign officials Thursday in a conference call with reporters, identifying skyrocketing hurricane insurance as one of Florida's great homeowner problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klein said McCain has overstated the potential cost of the program to taxpayers, just &quot;tossing out a number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was quoted in a Jan. 23 news article as saying he was &quot;not in favor of spending $200 billion a year simply for the state of Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the cost at about $25 billion a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klein also criticized McCain for saying he would improve the Federal Emergency Management Agency instead of creating a cat fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klein noted that FEMA has little or nothing to do with insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unclear to me how Sen. McCain has come to the realization that FEMA is the answer,&quot; Klein said. He said McCain appears uninformed or &quot;not speaking honestly&quot; on the issue.</SPAN></P>
