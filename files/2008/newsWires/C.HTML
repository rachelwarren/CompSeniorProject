</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">H ere's what strikes me this election eve: I can't remember a presidential campaign that was so disconnected from the actual challenges of governing that will confront the winner the morning after. When this election campaign began two years ago, the big issue was how and for how long we continue nation-building in Iraq. As the campaign comes to a close, the big issue is how and at what sacrifice we do nation-building in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, you'd barely know that from the presidential debates. Watching them in the context of the meltdown of the financial system was like watching a game show where the two contestants were kept offstage in a soundproof booth and brought out to address the audience without knowing the context. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the last debate, John McCain and Barack Obama have unveiled broad ideas about how to restore the nation's financial health. But they continue to suggest that this will be largely pain-free. McCain says giving everyone a tax cut will save the day; Obama tells us only the rich will have to pay to help us out of this hole. Neither is true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> going to have to pay, because this meltdown comes in the context of what has been &quot;perhaps the greatest wealth transfer since the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1917,&quot; says Michael Mandelbaum, author of &quot;Democracy's Good Name.&quot; &quot;It is not a wealth transfer from rich to poor that the Bush administration will be remembered for. It is a wealth transfer from the future to the present.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Never has one generation spent so much of its children's wealth in such a short period of time with so little to show for it as in the Bush years. Under George W. Bush, America has foisted onto future generations a huge financial burden to finance our current tax cuts, wars and now bailouts. Just paying off those debts will require significant sacrifices. But when you add the destruction of wealth that has taken place in the last two months in the markets, and the need for more bailouts, you understand why this is not going to be a painless recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bush team leaves us with another debt -- one to Mother Nature. We have added tons more CO2 into the atmosphere these last eight years, without any mitigation effort. As a result, slowing down climate change in the next eight years is going to require even bigger changes and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> investments in how we use energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given that New York Times columnists are not allowed to &quot;formally&quot; endorse candidates and given that the context of this election has changed so much from the policy positions the candidates started with, all I can suggest is that you vote for the candidate with these character traits:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, we need a president who can speak English and deconstruct and navigate complex issues so Americans can make informed choices. We have paid an enormous price for having a president who could not explain and reassure us during this financial meltdown. We wasted a huge amount of time pretending that we could punish Wall Street without punishing Main Street -- when, in fact, they are intricately intertwined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A major money market fund -- Reserve Primary -- failed in September because the extra interest it offered customers derived, in part, from the $785 million in high-yielding Lehman Brothers commercial paper and notes it was holding. Depositors who told their congressmen to just let that greedy Lehman Brothers fail were shocked to discover this meant that their own money market would be frozen. No, we don't need a president defending greed on Wall Street, but we do need one who can explain that we are all in the same boat, that a leak at one end can sink everyone and that while we must regulate, we don't want to kill risk-taking and the rewards that go with that -- which are essential to growing our economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, we need a president who can energize, inspire and hold the country together during what will be a very stressful recovery. We have to climb out of this financial crisis at a time when the baby boomers are about to retire and going to need their Social Security and eventually Medicare. We are all going to be paying the government more and getting less until we grow out of this hole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been a long, at times hilarious, two-year race down the presidential campaign trail. Taking the long view back, here are some of the most memorable pop culture moments of the journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dana Coffield, Stephen Keating and Tucker Shaw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---------------------------------------- It's 3 a.m. and I'm ready to rule:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Rodham Clinton launches an early negative salvo with a February 2008 TV ad that wondered aloud, &quot;Who do you want answering the red phone in the Oval Office at 3 a.m.?&quot; Barack Obama's campaign fires back with a commercial that answers: Someone who had the clarity of thought to vote against the Iraq war. Satirists strike with one of their own, suggesting the only call Hillary will get at 3 a.m. is from Bill, home after a night of clubbing and locked out of the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---------------------------------------- </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrap yourself in the flag:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What started out as an innocent &quot;crush on Obama&quot; propelled Amber Lee Ettinger, a.k.a. Obama Girl, to political luminary status. Don't ask us how or why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America inoculated with viral video: YouTube was just a fun way to burn off a few hours at work until hip-hop artist Will.i.am launched the 4-minute, 30-second clip of artists singing the speech about hope that Barack Obama gave after he lost the New Hampshire primary. In the first two weeks it was posted on YouTube and Obama's campaign website, the &quot;Yes We Can&quot; video drew more than 14 million page views. Can we spread the word without the filter of a political machine? Why yes, yes we can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jump back JibJab: The animators finally showed up July 15 with an equal-opportunity skewering of politics and the candidates. One of the brightest moments of &quot;Time for Some Campaignin',&quot; a spot-on parody sung to Bob Dylan's &quot;The Times They Are A'Changin,&quot; is the Disney-esque sequence featuring Obama astride a galloping unicorn singing &quot;I've got one or two things to say about change, the change we must change to the change we hold dear. I really like change, have I made myself clear?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What were they thinking? The New Yorker magazine proves that Manhattan satire works best, well, in Manhattan, with an early-summer cover that portrayed Michelle and Barack Obama as terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Playing catch-up: Riffing on the supremely irritating 1999 Budweiser &quot;Wassup&quot; commercials, where four guys call one another and yell &quot;wassup!&quot; into the phone, we fast-forward eight years and one of the guys is sitting in his foreclosed house when he gets called by a guy who is calling from a pay phone in the desert of Iraq, another has a cast on his neck and arm but can't pay for pain meds. Wassup? Change! The ad opines, ordering viewers to VOTE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We got a gusher here:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Sixpack is kicked to the curb by Joe the Plumber, a Holland, Ohio tradesman who gotcha'd Obama on the campaign trail about the Democrat's tax policy and then was adopted as the new everyman by McCain and Palin, to the point that his name was dropped 13 times in the first minutes of the final presidential debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Snowmachine&quot; enters the lexicon of the Lower 48.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Star light, star bright: Sure, we're electing a president and all, but we're also unofficially</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">choosing our next generation of news personalities. The brightest star? MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, who regularly wallops CNN behemoth Larry King in the ratings. Maddow leans left, but it's her regular, good-natured sparring matches with Pat Buchanan that suggest a new era in respectful, non-yelling television partisanship. Honorable mention: No-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nonsense Campbell Brown, who emerged from the shadows of network news to anchor the pre-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson hour on CNN with precision and personality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resurrection of &quot;SNL&quot;: Satirists are re-energized by the nomination of Alaska Gov. Sarah &quot;Caribou Barbie&quot; Palin for veep, as are members of the party core, who embrace sexism as a form of endearment in the political arena and show it by waving signs reading &quot;America's Hottest Governor&quot; on the convention floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one does it better than Fred Armisen, though: Audiences are captivated by new technologies deployed by CNN. Baiting the hook: John King's magic screen. Setting it: the hypnotic electronic fever chart that tracked the response of undecided voters - in real time - during the debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See you in the White House, Paris: McCain needles Obama for allegedly being just a celebrity, like Paris Hilton. The socialite's McCain-donor parents respond by withdrawing their support. Hilton, aided by writer Adam McKay (&quot;Talladega Nights,&quot; &quot;Anchorman&quot;) and producer Chris Henchy (&quot;Entourage&quot;), issues a rebuttal that excoriates &quot;that wrinkly white- haired guy&quot; and includes a more thoughtful energy policy than either real candidate had laid out. Oh, and the promise to paint the White House pink if she's elected. All this and proof that the best teleprompter reader in the campaign might not be Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeah, he's a rock star: At least five times during the primary campaign Obama found himself calling for the EMTs because swooning fans had fainted in the audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it with a straight face: During the July 27, 2007, YouTube online primary debates, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper introduced Billiam the Snowman, an animated character from Point Hope, Alaska. Billiam, who sounded an awful lot like &quot;Saturday Night Live's&quot; claymation character Mr. Bill, noted that he felt that global warming, the single most important issue to the snowmen of the country, was being neglected. &quot;What, as president, will you do to ensure my son will live a full and happy life?&quot; the frosty father asked. Predictably, Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich, the greenest candidate on the panel, nailed the answer, drawing a link between global warming and the nation's reliance on coal and petroleum. &quot;We don't have to have our snowmen melting,&quot; he offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cultural creatives available in GOP styles too: McCain solos on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; the weekend before Election Day, spoofing opposite Tina Fey, as Palin, as host of a late- night QVC show. &quot;This past Wednesday, Barack Obama purchased airtime on three major networks. We, however, can only afford QVC,&quot; he said. Then McCain and Fey pitched a set of commemorative plates celebrating the 10 town hall meetings McCain wanted with Obama (blank, because Obama took a pass) and jewelry from the McCain Fine Gold collection (get it, McCain-Feingold?).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They shoulda gone with Bubba: For the past four election cycles Family Circle magazine readers have picked the new president correctly by voting for one political family's cookie recipe over another. This year, Cindy McCain's Oatmeal-Butterscotch Cookies were favored over Michelle Obama's citrus and almond Shortbread Cookies, 54 percent to 44 percent. Bill Clinton's fave Oatmeal Cookie recipe got just 2 percent of the vote before his wife, Hillary, conceded the nomination to Obama. All of this might have just slipped right into the electronic dustbin were it not for someone out there noticing that the McCain recipe is nearly identical to that found on the back of the butterscotch chip bag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hurricane Ike = Buzzkill for the GOP convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mirror, mirror: Michelle Obama called out as an &quot;elitist&quot; for suggesting Americans might use part of their $600 economic stimulus check to buy earrings, followed by Vanity Fair magazine calling out Cindy McCain for wearing an outfit (and jewelry) at the GOP convention valued at $300,000, and, later, McCain/Palin campaign calling itself out in finance reports that revealed $150,000 spent to outfit Palin, her husband and five children for the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain, Obama urge voters to act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barack Obama and John McCain uncorked massive get-out-the-vote operations in more than a dozen battleground states Sunday, millions of telephone calls, mailings and door-knockings in a frenzied, fitting climax to a record-shattering $1 billion campaign. Together, they'll spend about $8 per presidential vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just two days to go, most national polls show Obama ahead of McCain. State surveys suggest the Democrat's path to the requisite 270 electoral votes -- and perhaps far beyond -- is much easier to navigate than McCain's.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police say five homeless people were found shot to death in a makeshift camp near some Los Angeles-area freeway ramps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Long Beach police say they responded to an anonymous call Sunday morning. They found the bodies of five adults in a brush-filled area between some commercial buildings and a freeway interchange.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. Geological Survey says a significant earthquake has jolted the ocean floor near Alaska's remote Aleutian Islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency says in a preliminary report that the magnitude-6.1 quake struck the seismically active but sparsely populated island chain at 4:49 a.m. Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was centered at a depth of about 39 miles, and 35 miles southwest of the island of Atka, which lies about 1,100 miles southwest of Anchorage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A suicide car bomber rammed his vehicle into a checkpoint near the Afghan border Sunday, causing an explosion that killed eight Pakistani paramilitary troops in a militant-infested region recently hammered by suspected U.S. missiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deadly blast occurred near the main gate of the Zalai Fort as Frontier Corps troops gathered nearby, said Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, the Pakistan army's top spokesman. Four people were wounded, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fort is 12 miles outside Wana, the main town in South Waziristan, a tribal region considered a hub for al-Qaida and Taliban fighters involved in attacks on U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eleven policemen have been shot to death near Mexico City in a three-day string of drug-gang attacks, prosecutors said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mexico State prosecutor Alberto Bazbaz said 10 suspects believed linked to drug gangs have been arrested in the killings, which mainly occurred on highways and at police checkpoints in the state that loops around Mexico's capital. Some of the suspects were carrying rifles and grenades at the time of their arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bazbaz said evidence indicates that low-level traffickers and criminals, rather than organized cartel hit squads, were responsible for the attacks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bolivian President Evo Morales suspended U.S. anti-drug operations on Saturday as Washington's relations with his leftist government spiraled downward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morales accused the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration of espionage and funding &quot;criminal groups&quot; trying to undermine his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He announced the indefinite suspension while declaring that his government has eradicated more than 12,300 acres of illegally planted coca so far this year -- the minimum required under a 1988 Bolivian law passed under U.S. pressure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Decline in gas prices</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won't last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The price numbers at the nation's gas pumps have been clicking in welcome reverse for the past few weeks and days. They may not be going down fast enough to suit consumers, but they've dropped significantly from highs above $4 a gallon last summer. In the Houston area there have been sightings as low as $2.22 for a gallon of regular unleaded. Now, that's relief. How long it will last is anybody's guess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sliding pump prices have raised concerns that the nation will slip into its old habits of conspicuous consumption and lose its political will to transition to renewable energy sources. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recent relief at the pump must not cause the nation to lose sight of long-term goals. These include increasing conservation, addressing global warming issues, lessening dependence on oil from unstable areas, &quot;greening&quot; our energy supplies and moving toward renewable sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a nation, we're building a bridge to a more stable energy future. The building blocks for this effort include enhanced domestic production of oil and gas, clean coal, nuclear, wind and solar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Above all, the bridge will be built with our ingenuity. The project must not be sidetracked by changes in price that probably won't last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Houston Chronicle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Polls don't decide, voters do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Washington Post poll reported a 10-point lead for the Democratic presidential candidate in 13 key &quot;swing&quot; states 16 days before the election. That candidate was John Kerry. That election year was 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Election Day 2004 arrived, &quot;exit poll&quot; trends reported to the public before the real polls closed also indicated that Sen. Kerry would win the White House. When the real votes were counted, he lost by more than 3 million votes to President Bush, though it took a relatively slim, 118,775-vote triumph in Ohio for the in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cumbent to win the Electoral College and keep his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So despite Sen. Kerry's apparent inside track to victory, he was not elected president. And despite the significant edge Barack Obama has held over John McCain in most recent polls, particularly in &quot;swing&quot; states, he hasn't won the presidency yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you find following competing poll fluctuations informative and even entertaining, enjoy. But don't let their often-illusory figures obscure this persisting political reality:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Polls don't determine election outcomes. Voters do.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cost of teen pregnancy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We see the effects of teenage parenthood every day, especially among low-income youth whose opportunities are limited before they acquire the additional responsibilities that come with kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We figure the trend must be costly to the general public, as well, knowing what we know about the public services that are required to feed, clothe and house a population that is less likely to graduate from high school, more likely to be on welfare or in jail and more likely to continue the cycle of children having children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New research presented last week at a national forum in Chicago produced a shocking estimate of the cost to the public -- $7.6 billion a year. With Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi all well over the national average in the birth rate for teenagers, we know that in the Mid-South we're paying more than our proportionate share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We know, too, how the trend is contributing to the breakdown of the family that is costing so much culturally as well as economically. And we know how to address the problem -- with better schools, with better sex education in the schools and with mentors who provide strong, positive role models.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The longest and most expensive presidential election in United States history is almost over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But first, brace yourself for the next 36 hours of honking horns, long lines, robo- calls, last-second mailers, intersections overflowing with sign wavers that slow traffic and, yes, a final television and radio ad blitz. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigns of Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama have swarmed Colorado, one of the last remaining battleground states. And while many people have voted early, just as many have not. As a result, Coloradans can expect to be deluged by last-minute get-out-the-vote activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain running mate Sarah Palin will be in Colorado Springs today, and Obama's wife, Michelle, will hold a rally in Littleton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the McCain campaign is running nearly nonstop phone banks, where it has microtargeted voters for months leading up to Election Day. As a result, staffers know who has voted and who hasn't, said spokesman Tom Kise. Not only will callers urge voters to get to the polls, they will offer rides to people who need them and answer any questions voters have. Thousands of volunteers - many who have come from out of state to help - will go door-to-door asking people to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the effort is statewide. Although there are many Republican-leaning counties in Colorado, McCain's campaign is reaching out everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are targeting the person, not the ZIP code,&quot; Kise said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign also is canvassing the state. It has &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of volunteers walking in their own neighborhoods, talking to undecided voters and people they think may support Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are covering every corner of the state,&quot; said Stephanie Mueller, communications director for Obama's Colorado campaign. &quot;You can't just focus on a few counties. We are running exactly the same program on the Western Slope as we are in Denver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mueller said the campaign is sending buses to a number of college campuses in the state to transport students to the polls. And volunteers are ready to provide free rides to anyone who needs them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember will.i.am.'s &quot;Yes We Can&quot; video, the stylized celebrity endorsements of Sen. Barack Obama that swept YouTube earlier this year?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only a couple of days until the election, it's beginning to look more like &quot;Yes He Will.&quot; The spark of Obama's campaign has remained viable throughout this long election cycle, thanks in part to the unprecedented mobilization of the youth vote, which appears to be leaning in his direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Obama wins, he might want to thank the folks at Rock the Vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year we had the largest youth voter registration drive in the country's history,&quot; said Heather Smith, executive director of Washington-based Rock the Vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest on record, she said, was in 2004 when 1.2 million people downloaded a registration form from Rock the Vote. That more than doubled this year to 2.54 million downloads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, anything can happen on Election Day, but polls indicate these numbers are good for Democrats. A recent CBS News/UWIRE/The Chronicle of Higher Education poll of 25,000 college students in Colorado, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania showed more than 60 percent preferred Obama and Joe Biden to John McCain and Sarah Palin. And more than 90 percent said they were planning to vote on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not and will not endorse or support a candidate or political party,&quot; Rock the Vote's Smith said. &quot;Our mission is to use new technology and pop culture to attract young people to politics that might otherwise not get involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rock the Vote, founded in 1992, launched a national bus tour on Sept. 13 and has extended it through Election Day to continue educating and encouraging young voters. The swing-state leg of the tour finishes in Denver on Monday with a concert from the Beastie Boys and Tenacious D at the Fillmore Auditorium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We actually played a Rock the Vote show in L.A. the year they were founded,&quot; said the Beastie Boys' Adam Horovitz, a.k.a. Ad-Rock. &quot;We're doing it again because we feel like the whole country is stressing out, regardless of who they're voting for. And we should be stressed out. In both Bush elections it seemed like the voting process was just so bizarre. Everybody's thinking, 'Is this funny stuff going to happen again?&quot;'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horovitz pointed to a sobering statistic from the 2004 election to explain why the Beasties hit the road for Rock the Vote: In 2004, 70 million registered voters didn't make it to the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In every election you watch, MTV and the commercials are like, 'Voting is awesome. Hipsters vote. It's really cool!&quot;' he said. &quot;But if you think your candidate has got it and is going to win, you're wrong. We can't let an election as huge as this come down to a few thousand votes,&quot; Horovitz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rock the Vote hopes to build on past successes by continuing to use celebrities and musicians to draw young people to the polls. From Madonna draping herself in an American flag while singing &quot;Vogue&quot; in 1992 to this year's tours with Vampire Weekend, Sheryl Crow and Santogold, Rock the Vote employs a diverse set of tools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 2004, 82 percent of registered voters under 30 went to the polls, so we know we brought all these new young people in,&quot; Smith said. &quot;There is a 'ripple-up' effect when younger voters go the polls. They bring their roommates, their friends, their parents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, when Time magazine declared 2008 &quot;The Year of the Youth Vote,&quot; it attributed Obama's overwhelming victory in the Iowa caucuses to people under the age of 25. Rock the Vote's presence was also strong in Denver during the Democratic National Convention, with concerts bringing national and local acts to the stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The success of such efforts, however, is difficult to measure. During a Rock the Vote concert at the Ellie Caulkins Opera House in August, organizers had to shut down the venue's bar to force patrons inside the near-empty theater to watch Jakob Dylan's opening set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A planned Rock the Vote concert at the Denver Performing Arts Complex sculpture park featuring local acts was moved at the last minute to the Denver skate park in the Central Platte Valley, which affected turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the event was a total flop with a good cause, and if the right people would have been behind it, it would have been cool,&quot; Alan Andrews of the band the Photo Atlas said via e-mail. &quot;Maybe it wasn't their fault and the venue change really did screw everything up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the larger question over celebrity get-out-the-vote efforts seems to have been answered on a national scale in this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Politics belongs in whatever you're doing,&quot; said the Beastie Boys' Horovitz. &quot;If you're in the spotlight or public eye and you want to say something, you should say it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Television by Joanne Ostrow A big race, mightily shaped by scenes on the small screen</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARTS &amp; ENTERTAINMENT; Pg. E-01</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1250 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battered broadcast networks bounced back to relevance this presidential election year, delivering images, buzz phrases and parodies that ricocheted on the air and then endlessly around the Web. Ratings soared. Even the driest of the TV debates outdrew the rest of prime time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the low-bar name-calling of &quot;The View&quot; to the sober Colin Powell endorsement delivered on &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; with Katie Couric's comeback interview, Tina Fey's defining impersonation, David Letterman's faux hurt feelings and a closing infomercial that may have redefined the political ad in the mix, television had a heavier hand than usual in conducting the nation's political business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-one months of campaign coverage felt like the world's longest reality TV show. Really, though, it was a collision of high- and low-brow political, entertainment and gossip outlets exploiting the campaigns to their own ends - for humor, for web hits, for ratings or partisan outrage - and tightening the nonstop news cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it worked. It made TV must-see again and, it's fair to say, more than ever, TV impacted the outcome of the election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again and again, the campaigns mattered less than the media images of them. Those of us on the couch assessed &quot;character&quot; and &quot;temperament&quot; via style more than through speeches and official statements. The sight of Barack Obama dancing on Ellen DeGeneres' show meant more to more people than his domestic policy talking points. The visual of John McCain shuffling around a televised &quot;town hall&quot; registered on a deeper level than his stump speeches. Fey's spot-on Sarah Palin impersonation and Couric's devastating interview were turning points in voters' minds. Politics and entertainment merged in what Seth Meyers called a &quot;snake eating its tail moment,&quot; when Hillary Clinton gave &quot;SNL&quot; a shout-out during a debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a lot of garbage, but after years of being scolded for failing to ask the tough questions, television proved its worth as a truth-seeking medium in the 2008 election cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TV is a great lie detector. The camera's unblinking eye is better at observing than probing, but it does eventually force truth to the surface. Palin was terrific on TV, until she wasn't. Prolonged exposure allowed the American public to move beyond Palin's star-making turn reading a teleprompter. Couric brought an unrehearsed side of the candidate into focus even as the candidate railed against &quot;the filter of the media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, negative ads were powerful, until they weren't. Repetition and truth squads allowed viewers the time to weigh and reject distortions and untruths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television made the candidates excruciatingly familiar as they camped out in our living rooms through endless debates. Cranky or elitist? Too old or too inexperienced? Beyond canned zingers and market-tested answers, prolonged exposure revealed personal tics, body language and style points, judged by the citizenry in record numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's small-screen charisma boosted by eloquence was inarguably telegenic. His young children likewise were made-for-TV cute. Some 33 million viewers caught Wednesday's slickly produced infomercial, designed to make Obama seem at once presidential and regular. His campaign proved most adept at reimagining the political uses of television, updating the Ross Perot chart talk of 1992 with a hopeful 30-minute docu-bio-rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's grimaces and eye rolling, apparent in close-ups during debates, and his initial reluctance to look at or engage his opponent onstage, did not play well on TV. Often his battle-worn screen image seemed at odds with the battle-tested words he expressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The importance of mainstream media imagery could be seen in online efforts to compare and contrast the PDA's (public displays of affection) of the physically close Obamas and the more restrained McCains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glued to the tube</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to glib talk and fist bumps, a remarkable level of informed debate was broadcast in 2008. Amazingly, 50 million of us gathered to hear back-and-forth on policy- wonkish details of tax policies and health plans. More amazingly, 70 million of us spent an evening sizing up the vice presidential contenders. During a particularly weak season of network entertainment (&quot;Knight Rider,&quot; anyone?), We the People chose Jim Lehrer, Gwen Ifill, Tom Brokaw and Bob Schieffer instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surprising hit ratings for the debates gave way to television's pundit love-in, overpopulated roundtable discussions. (Jon Stewart noted that the inexhaustible supply of opinionated pundits are qualified because they have &quot;a face and a functioning mouth.&quot;) When Donna Brazile, David Gergen, James Carville, Jeffrey Toobin, Paul Begala, Alex Castellanos, Gloria Borger and William Bennett engaged, the crosstalk was useless for anything but parody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New techno-info-graphics, like CNN's bars monitoring audience reaction (judging the sweaty palms of male and female observers) and analyst scorecards (monitoring who was pro and con on the candidates), further cluttered the screen. How long before the networks wire the candidates for live EKG scans during debates?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unforeseen resurgence of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; was a boon not only to NBC but also to the world of YouTube, Hulu and the rest. As the economy tanked, how many work hours, in how many offices across America, were lost to streaming the latest Tina Fey sketch or Fred Armisen parody of John King's touch-screen map?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Coloradans, the oddity of seeing national broadcasts of the Democratic National Convention, taking place down the block, was a reminder of the weirdness of the media echo chamber. If you were standing in the crowd two miles from the podium, were you any closer than if you were at home, seeing closeups on the screen? And how strange was it to be huddled around the computer, live streaming, as if listening to a vintage radio's fireside chat?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TV on the Web</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course earlier campaigns ventured into popular media. When Bill Clinton played saxophone on Arsenio Hall's show, the political media landscape shifted. When McCain announced his candidacy on Letterman's late-night soapbox, he upped the ante.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This election was different thanks to the evolution of the web. The Internet doesn't allow TV moments to fade, extending the life of every gaffe- as Joe Biden learned the hard way. The truthtelling that is political satire enjoyed a renaissance. The best TV jokes got an afterlife online, popping up in reruns faster than you could say &quot;Huffington Post.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long media march created new stars - Rachel Maddow debuted to stellar ratings for MSNBC and Elisabeth Hasselbeck of &quot;The View&quot; made her bow as political warm-up act for Palin. Keith Olbermann edged out Bill O'Reilly in key ratings; both of them stole the spotlight from Rush Limbaugh. Our fascination with &quot;Obama Girl&quot; gave way to PalinasPresident.com (complete with lipstick'd pit bull).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so it was ironic that, as robo-calls were replayed on TV, the contest's climactic turning point was an old-school media moment: Colin Powell dissing McCain and endorsing Obama on &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only notable absence was Oprah Winfrey's. The talk-show host endorsed Obama early on, but consciously avoided the spotlight during the campaign rather than eclipse the candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sparked speculation that, if true, would tie pop culture to politics as closely as Ronald Reagan did: The London Times reported that Winfrey's name has been floated as Obama's ambassador to Great Britain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he Keystone Kops</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Treasury Department finally figured out that the majority of banks (especially smaller and regional) don't have publicly traded stock, and so can't participate in the proposed cash-injections-for-preferred-stock deals unless the Feds change the rules. Secretary Henry Paulson should have been on top of this. And the Bushies assumed that the banks would lend the money, rather than hoarding it or buying other banks as they are doing. Like former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan with his fantasy about enlightened corporate self-interest, it must be tough when you can't distinguish ideology from reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting borrowers and lenders to work together by setting up government trustees to re-do mortgage terms when mortgage bond administrators are conflicted was proposed in the New York Times op-ed &quot;Mortgage Justice is Blind&quot; on Thursday. In addition to addressing the fundamental issues underlying this crash, this approach requires no bailout money, so those people who were prudent won't have to bail out those who weren't (or pay for Paulson's Wall Street buddies' lunches.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steve Pomerance </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Udall's scary health insurance policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beware Mark Udall's health care policy. He evaded a simple question in the Camera's Candidate Profile: &quot;Should the federal government follow the lead of Massachusetts and have a mandatory health care plan?&quot; His Web site clarifies: &quot;I believe a requirement for health insurance coverage ... will increase the distribution of health care costs over the entire population.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He's right, but this is wrong for consumers. Mandatory insurance forces you to pay for other people's health care at the expense of your own. When politicians force you to buy insurance, they decide what policy is acceptable, not you. They could pander to special interests by mandating that your insurance include expensive benefits you may not want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consider Massachusetts. The Boston Globe reports that residents whose insurance does not meet regulations &quot;could face a hefty tax penalty.&quot; Too bad for those who like their current policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Would Udall want this, or Massachusetts' other problems? Massachusetts authorities will &quot;probably cut payments to doctors and hospitals&quot; and &quot;reduce choices for patients,&quot; reports the Globe. It also reports that &quot;the wait to see primary care doctors in Massachusetts has grown to as long as 100 days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Udall also supports expanding SCHIP, government-controlled insurance for kids. For every 10 kids in SCHIP, six drop private insurance. That's unfair competition. Worse yet, SCHIP is a &quot;low-wage trap&quot; that punishes recipients for increasing their income. But for politicians, SCHIP expansion can help create a generation who votes for politician-controlled medicine from cradle to grave. Just get them addicted as children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brian Schwartz</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palin's energy independence plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sarah Palin is seeking to rally her &quot;drill-baby-drill&quot; base with the slogan of energy independence. And it may be a shrewd tactic since many Americans even outside the so-called GOP base are understandably concerned about the long-term trend of rising gasoline prices and dependence on foreign petroleum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it's an entirely specious claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unless Gov. Palin wants to really become a socialist by requiring that U.S. petroleum companies sell only to Americans, the global free marketplace she wholeheartedly supports will allow any extra light sweet American crude to be exported to the highest bidder. Thus, as the developing world continues to demand more gasoline, petroleum will be exported abroad. Indeed, all independent studies indicate that opening up U.S. public lands to further drilling would have very little impact on U.S. prices at the pump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, as Mark Udall points out, U.S. oil companies already have myriad existing-yet-unused drilling rights on American soil. They would rather import from elsewhere more cheaply. So unless her government would seek to place a great deal more control over the U.S. petroleum industry by forcing companies to drill here even when they would prefer not to, and restrict the resulting gasoline sales to American consumers, Palin's plan is plain pablum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spreading a little wealth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Gary McCoy Halloween cartoon hitting my e-mail box may make you laugh. It goes like this: A man opened the door to three trick-or-treating little children on his porch. He said, &quot;Look how much candy you have! I'm going to take half and give it to the kids too lazy to go trick or treating for themselves!&quot; The little witch said, &quot;Oh crap, a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you're not laughing, maybe you're justifying. Some kids are too sick to go out for their own candy. Others have unsafe neighborhoods or can't get to neighborhoods with candy. Also, some parents can't take their children out at all. The list goes on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If redistributing the wealth of candy is so important, leveling the playing field in political campaigns should be a no-brainer. Both McCain and Obama promised to accept public campaign funds to level that field. McCain kept his promise. Obama didn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One result is Obama accumulated so much money he aired a half-hour ad on several TV stations on Wednesday. He didn't offer and wouldn't have liked &quot;the man&quot; to give some of his &quot;candy&quot; to McCain. Apparently, Obama's redistributing wealth only applies to taking money for his causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shirley Scoville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every vote should count</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Building confidence in the U.S. election is central to our nation's democracy. That is how people choose their leaders and hold them accountable. If elections are defective, the democratic system is at risk. The above are words borrowed from the Report of the Commission on Federal Election Reform that met in September 2005 at American University, Washington, D.C., and was co-chaired by Jimmy Carter and James A. Baker III.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here we are on the eve of the 2008 presidential election and the worthy recommendations of the Commission have largely been ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It recommended a five point program to create a modern electoral system:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A universal registration list that would be accessible to the public and available nationally. Such a list should be controlled by states and not by local jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A &quot;real&quot; single ID card as a uniform voter system that would simplify and encourage voter registration and participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those without photo ID would receive provisional ballots that would be counted after signatures were verified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> States rather than local jurisdictions should be responsible for encouraging voters to register and for making voting easier in accessible locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An auditable paper trail and improved security of the voting systems when electronic voting machines are used. The Commission also called for alternative technologies for counting ballots. This included independent testing of voting machines and software source codes under the direction of a Federal agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The creation of electoral institutions that are impartial, non-partisan, independent and professional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> W e see Obama/Biden yard signs all over, and they stay there. We have to put McCain/Palin signs in windows or on high fences, because that's the only way we can keep them from being taken. And we're still concerned that our properties will be vandalized!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> signs swiped, too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was dismayed to read the recent letters to the editor complaining about McCain signs being stolen in Sunshine Canyon. I also live in the canyon and have had several Obama and Udall signs stolen and vandalized. The writer complaining about the theft of his signs assumed that this occurred because Obama and his supporters are oriented toward suppressing dissenting information. I have to admit that my initial reaction to the thefts of my signs was not very positive toward McCain supporters. In fact, I believe that there are a few supporters of both candidates who have behaved inappropriately and that is does not reflect the positions of either of them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vote yes to retain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Klein</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was deeply angered by the cowardly, vengeful, anonymous advertisement in the Camera regarding the adverse possession case which recently came before the court of Judge James Klein. The ad recommended that he be removed from office because of his ruling on the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Klein should actually be commended for sticking to his job of interpreting and enforcing the law as it existed. This man has demonstrated outstanding judicial skill, as well as a considerable amount of courage, in making and standing behind this ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The law related to adverse possession is clearly both obsolete and unfair. But it's the job of the Legislative Branch, not the Judicial Branch, to revise or eliminate unfair and obsolete laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Judge Klein should be retained in his current position. I urge everyone to vote accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keep on talking,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gov. Palin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> S arah Palin's recent attacks on Barack Obama sparkle with irony, as she tries to remind voters of the candidate's past connection to his former</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> minister Jeremiah Wright. I wonder does it occur to Palin that she is one Achilles heel conjuring up the name of another not nearly so damaging as she is?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palin has done more good for Obama than any one individual not on his team. Polls and appalled conservative detractors indicate this. It was as if after the Wright brouhaha, the McCain camp developed embarrassment envy and decided that it was unfair that they did not have their own cross to bear, and after much stomping and gnashing of teeth, someone brought up the name of the Alaska governor. Voil&aacute;, the campaign had its own tacky, one-woman vaudeville show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So as an Obama supporter, I hope Gov. Palin continues to talk and talk and talk (and, of course, never runs out of lipstick). With enemies like her, one barely needs friends.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No on 52</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sportsmen should not support 52</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A s Colorado heads to the polls, I would encourage all Colorado sportsmen to vote no on Amendment 52. This amendment will create a constitutional earmark that permanently hamstrings important Department of Natural Resources (DNR) programs that work on forest health, keeping species off the endangered list and battling aquatic invaders like zebra mussels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Proponents want you to think that DNR has too much money already and that Amendment 52 would capture only the &quot;surplus&quot; oil and gas revenues in order to fund transportation projects along I-70. What they fail to mention is Amendment 52 will strangle the biggest source of funding for new state water projects, a program that is now underfunded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's why every major state water provider, including Denver Water and the Colorado River Water Conservation District, oppose Amendment 52. So do a roster of conservative Republicans as well as Club 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's the great irony: Amendment 52 will pull the plug on Colorado's water without providing a real fix for our transportation problems. What's more, not a single transportation district supports Amendment 52. That ought to tell you something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amendment 52 was born as a purely political effort by three ambitious politicians to undercut another measure aimed at oil and gas revenues, Amendment 58. Amendment 52's sponsors don't care how many other Coloradans get hurt so long as Gov. Ritter loses. It's a mean-spirited, short-sighted, political stunt that's gotten out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We can't afford to have this political stunt written into our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> state's constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brandon Shaffer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for District 17</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I write this in response to the article about the Senate District 17 election (Oct. 11, &quot;Longmont mom challenges incumbent senator&quot;). In the heat of the national contests it is important that voters realize that real progress on energy, education and the economy begins at home. It is in that spirit that I urge the voters of State Senate District 17 to re-elect Brandon Shaffer. Senator Shaffer, a native Coloradan, understands the values of hard work and personal responsibility. Senator Shaffer financed his education with an ROTC scholarship and served our country for four years in active duty with the Navy. It is that experience, holding the idea that &quot;you get what you inspect not what you expect&quot; that has made him a champion for accountability in our State Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator Shaffer is married to a public school teacher and is deeply committed to making our state a leader in education. He knows that in order for us to realize the potential of the new energy economy and make our state and economic powerhouse, we must prepare our workforce for the 21st century green collar jobs. Senator Shaffer is a graduate of the CU law school and is dedicated to justice. Unlike his opponent he supports a woman's right to choose, and the rights of all Coloradans to share life's wealth and challenges with a committed partner, regardless of orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We must elect local leaders who understand the importance of investing in Colorado.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B arack Obama and John McCain have received a lot of endorsements during the past few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pat Boone, Wilford Brimley, Arnold Palmer and Father Time all have lined up behind McCain and Sarah Palin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lindsay Lohan, Eminem, Joakim Noah and Bullwinkle have come out in support of Obama and Joe Biden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So in the spirit of the election season, we've compiled a random list of athletes and the products they've endorsed:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bill Clement for Deep Woods Off! OK, so most of you are saying, &quot;WHO??&quot; And that was the same reaction many had a few years ago when this ad featuring the NHL analyst ran. Some wondered if it was Mike Schmidt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muhammad Ali for d-Con. There were no face-recognition problems here as Madison Avenue finally gave the champion a chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Daly for TrimSpa. He wore the weight-loss program's emblem on his shirt at golf tournaments. Still trying to add Nicorette, A.A. and eHarmony.com to his resume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> George Foreman for Meineke. Burgers probably tasted better on these mufflers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dan Marino for Isotoner. Nice ad campaign, but when was the last time anyone needed gloves in South Florida?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Donovan McNabb and his fake mom for Campbell's Chunky Soup. The real Wilma McNabb eventually joined her son in the commercials, but the ad got old -- fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joe Namath for Beautymist Pantyhose. Broadway Joe took a lot of flak for this one. Not so much when Farrah Fawcett creamed him with Noxema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rafael Palmeiro for Viagra. Must've been relieved no one in Congress asked about this performance enhancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jim Palmer for Jockey underwear. The Baltimore Orioles Hall-of-Famer would have to go through an intense hair-removal process to nab this endorsement these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> O.J Simpson for Hertz. Hard to tell if he was running away from the cops, on his way to pick up a Ford Bronco, or chasing Nicole's killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the award for the best product endorsement by an athlete goes to ... Bob Uecker for Miller Lite. Back when Miller Lite commercials were relevant (remember the original &quot;Tastes great! Less filling!&quot; gang?), Uecker made a name for himself in a number of clever ads, including a classic in which a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bunch of guys in a bar mistook him for Whitey Ford. He made the line, &quot;I must be in the front row,&quot; a popular catch-phrase in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Honors for the worst product endorsement go to Fred McGriff for the Tom Emanski Instructional Video series. Who will ever forget the major-league superstar pointing at the camera and uttering his famous pitch: &quot;THIS is an instructional video that gets results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's 10 that didn't make the cut:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bill Belichick for the Sony Handycam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tonya Harding for Clue: &quot;Mrs. Peacock, in the dining room, with the ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gus Johnson for Sprint: &quot;So quiet you can hear a pin drop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Art Modell for the American Express Card: &quot;Don't leave home without it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Terrell Owens for No More Tears baby shampoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Danyelle Sargent for Encyclopedia Britannica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> O.J. Simpson for the Ginsu knife . . . or Topps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jackie Smith for Allstate Insurance: &quot;The good-hands people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Strahan for Polident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Vick for Cingular/AT&amp;T: &quot;More bars in more places.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Barack Obama: a sometimes controversial but widely respected Middle East scholar named Rashid Khalidi. In the past couple of days, McCain and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, have likened Khalidi, the director of a Middle East institute at Columbia University, to neo-Nazis; called him &quot;a PLO spokesman&quot;; and suggested that the Los Angeles Times is hiding something sinister by refusing to release a videotape of a 2003 dinner in honor of Khalidi at which Obama spoke. McCain even threw former Weatherman Bill Ayers into the mix, suggesting that the tape might reveal that Ayers -- a terrorist-turned-professor who also has been an Obama acquaintance -- was at the dinner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the record, Khalidi is an American born in New York who graduated from Yale a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> couple of years after George W. Bush. For much of his long academic career, he taught at the University of Chicago, where he and his wife became friends with Barack and Michelle Obama. In the early 1990s, he worked as an adviser to the Palestinian delegation at peace talks in Madrid and Washington sponsored by the first Bush administration. We don't agree with a lot of what Khalidi has had to say about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over the years, and Obama has made clear that he doesn't, either. But to compare the professor to neo-Nazis -- or even to Ayers -- is a vile smear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps unsurprising for a member of academia, Khalidi holds complex views. In an article published this year in the Nation magazine, he scathingly denounced Israeli practices in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and U.S. Middle East policy but also condemned Palestinians for failing to embrace a nonviolent strategy. He said that the two-state solution favored by the Bush administration (and Obama) was &quot;deeply flawed&quot; but conceded there were also &quot;flaws in the alternatives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's fair to question why Obama felt as comfortable as he apparently did during his Chicago days in the company of men whose views diverge sharply from what the presidential candidate espouses. Our sense is that Obama is a man of considerable intellectual curiosity who can hear out a smart, if militant, advocate for the Palestinians without compromising his own position. To suggest, as McCain has, that there is something reprehensible about associating with Khalidi is itself condemnable -- especially during a campaign in which Arab ancestry has been the subject of insults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Which reminds us: We did ask Khalidi whether he wanted to respond to the campaign charges against him. He answered, via e-mail, that &quot;I will stick to my policy of letting this idiot wind blow over.&quot; That's good advice for anyone still listening to the McCain campaign's increasingly reckless ad hominem attacks. Sadly, that wind is likely to keep blowing for three more days.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not appealing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> O h, my goodness! Is the Daily Camera singlehandedly trying to put Abo's Pizza out of business? The photo in Wednesday's Camera of the Abo's cook blowing air under a pizza goes beyond disgusting. All these years of going to yearly OSHA meetings has taught me a thing or two about basic standards of infection control and communicable diseases. I bet I'm not the only one who was grossed out by that photo. YUCK!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T he front-page photo of an Abo's worker blowing air under a pizza may cause the health department to restrict Abo's hours to zero. (&quot;Slice in late hours unlikely for Abo's&quot; Oct. 29).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allowing for a possible photo distortion of distance between the bearded man's mouth and the pizza, one cannot ignore the fact he is blowing forcefully on the food. Yes, the pizza is going into the oven where his germs and mustache dander may be rendered harmless, but this behind-the-scenes glimpse of food preparation dulls my appetite for Abo's.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vote yes on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amendment 48</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> F ear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) are the trade tactics of the anti-48 crowd. The plain truth of Amendment 48 is to have people acknowledge the scientific fact that all human life begins at conception. Amendment 48 gets back to fundamentals and affirms that life has value at all stages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Medical science did not have the diagnostic (4-D Ultrasound -- an amazing achievement!) and preservation (creation and freezing of human embryos for IVF treatments) when the Roe v. Wade decision was made. We have new knowledge! Those who are wise will examine the true evidence and choose to admit that scientific fact is scientific fact. Life begins at conception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is amazing that someone would flat-out state that a baby who is viable in her mother's womb is somehow less valuable, less entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness simply because she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hasn't exited the protective environment all humans lived in at the beginning of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fear mongers want you to believe all sorts of archaic laws will be implemented if 48 is approved by the voters of Colorado. That is simply not true. We live in a society that is permeated with checks and balances. If 48 passes don't you think the anti-48 supporters will be contesting it in our legal system immediately? You need to use your mind and remember that you too were once an embryo. Vote yes on Amendment 48.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I watched every minute of the Republican and Democratic conventions. I've listened, read and researched as much as possible everything I can find regarding the two presidential candidates. Last night was a microcosm of what I've been seeing during the past several months. I watched Obama's infomercial. Lots of talk about the middle class, hopes, dreams, ideas and plans for the future. A program for young people to get tax credits to finance their education by volunteering. No mention of McCain/Palin. Sort of similar to what I saw at the Democratic convention here in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I then watched the live interview with John McCain on CNN Larry King. He spent the majority of the time whining about Obama, how unfair the presidential race has been for him (McCain), how he wanted to know who Obama had dinner with 20 years ago and why he couldn't see the videotape of it? The only person he seemed to empathize with was himself. There was no excitement about new ideas or the future. He was careful to imply that Obama has dark secrets. No serious discussion of what folks in this country are going through. He complained about the amount of spending and how he would cut it (except for the $10 billion a month we pour into Iraq-which ends up in the hands of defense contractors like Halliburton).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He may very well have some good ideas (I've seen some of them) but he doesn't seem to know how to express them or sell them or generate any excitement for them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initiative 202, extending the 0.38 percent city sales and use tax (passed in 1988) indefinitely (beyond its current 2011 expiration date) will continue to fund general services such as police, fire, library, parks and human services. These basic services are essential to the community and downtown. Thirty-eight cents per $100 is an affordable and reasonable levy that has been in place for the place for the past 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initiative 2D will allow the city of Boulder to grant a lease of streets or public places or property for a period of up to 40 years. Forty year lease options will make it easier for tenants to secure loans allowing for necessary upgrades and remodels to the building themselves. This will enable many nonprofit organizations, as well as commercial businesses in Boulder pursue practical long-term financing for property upgrades and other goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DBI board of directors has taken positions on these two ballot initiatives believing both will contribute to the economic vitality of the Boulder and help maintain Downtown Boulder's status as a unique, historic and viable center of business, commerce and leisure for years to come.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for workers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A mendment 47 is a no win situation for the state of Colorado. If you would like to work and make less money, then please vote yes. That's right earn less. The average pay in so called &quot;right to work&quot; states was 13.1 percent lower than states where workers have the freedom to form strong unions. This works for union and non-union employees. Unions establish the wages for non-union crafts for their areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the &quot;right to work for less&quot; states they have a 41 percent higher job site fatalities reported by the Department of Labor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amendment 47 is a direct attack on income and will weaken all working people's paychecks in the state of Colorado. We are all having a hard enough time making it today with all the rising costs. Do you want to make even less and have a harder time trying to pay your bills? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state of Oklahoma was the last state to go to &quot;right to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> work and earn less&quot; nine years ago. In nine years, their wages have only increased 1 percent. Can you survive for the next nine years on that? In Colorado for the past nine years they have increased an average of 36 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You need to understand that the &quot;right to work&quot; (Amendment 47) truly means &quot;right to work for less.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Don't let the big businessmen of Colorado take it all away. Remember it's your paycheck. Vote no on Amendment 47.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deena Holland,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cast votes based</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on foundation of life</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I n response to the article written by Bob Rudland, faith columnist (Oct. 19), I question how he got this position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His comment, &quot;personally, I think that it is wrong to pick a candidate based on their stand on abortion,&quot; is to strip away the basic foundation on which this country was built, the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Another comment of his was, &quot;we face a bleak future for our children.&quot; Could this bleak future be the possibility of being the ones who will be aborted? And could these aborted children be perhaps the ones who could help heal humanity?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Again, to quote Mr. Rudland, &quot;our level of violence in the world has been steadily increasing.&quot; Does this include the 1.3 million baby humans violently killed by abortion in the United States annually? (Reported by the &quot;Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health,&quot; Jan. 2008).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yes, I do agree &quot;we are truly dysfunctional.&quot; By supporting pro-choice candidates, we are supporting a culture of death. All their promises of a good</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Main stream media</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> omits on Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T he main stream media (MSM) is beyond being biased and is now more like a propaganda machine. The MSM had saturation coverage on how bad the Mark Foley scandal was for Republicans prior to the 2006 elections, but is silent about the Democratic replacement Tim Mahoney with a much worse scandal closer to a presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Did you buy the hype that John Kerry was an intellect and that George Bush was a dummy? When Kerry's military records were released after the election the truth was revealed; Bush scored higher and got better grades than Kerry. There was a reason Kerry did not want his records released, just as Obama does not want his records released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you bought the Kerry smarter than Bush lie, know little about Tim Mahoney or that Obama's lawyers have gone to extremes to avoid records being released or know more about the Alaska Independence Party than the New Party, you are a MSM-only victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fear not, intelligent, proactive MSM-only victims can be cured by taking my prescription. Use a Web search engine and search on &quot;Obama Philip Berg.&quot; Why is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama fighting this lawsuit and not clearing this up by simply releasing the records? Web search &quot;Obama Al-Mansour&quot; and you will find out how Obama was able to attend Harvard Law School with a Mom on food stamps, no real job and less than stellar grades. Web search &quot;Obama New Party&quot; and you will find a much bigger story than the pathetic stories the MSM tell about Palin's clothes, husband or children. Web search &quot;Obama Raila Odinga&quot; and you will find the actual photographs of Obama actively campaigning for this man as a U.S. senator in 2006 at taxpayers' expense and real evidence that Obama raised $1 million for this brutal thug. Find out that that Bill Ayers appointed Obama to be the chairman of the &quot;Annenberg Challenge&quot; and follow the money ($50 million) on the Web.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Do not believe the Web links to the contrary, there is a Web video where Obama himself says he was the chairman of the Annenberg Challenge. What is the real connection between Obama and Tony Rezko? Web search &quot;Obama Crossroads Fund&quot; and find out more. How tight were &quot;Obama and ACORN&quot;? Who is &quot;Barry Soetoro?&quot; There is so much more out there but only 500 words allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I will lighten up and point you to some really enlightening clips on the Web titled &quot;Obama Speech -- Teleprompter Goes Out&quot; and &quot;Obama Claims He's Visited 57 States.&quot; Remember when journalism was investigative and reported the findings? The MSM would rather shape or make news like Dan Rather's fabrication than report it. Personally, I don't know how they can take any pride in their craft or for that matter sleep at night. Do not remain gullible victims of propaganda; search my quoted strings above on the Web and be cured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Bridenstine,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Westminster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vote Mitchell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> come Nov. 4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I can not imagine a more stark contrast than the two candidates running in state Senate District 23. Shawn Mitchell is an experienced, effective legislator who is a steadfast defender of personal freedom and an eloquent proponent of limited government. Joe Whitcomb, on the other hand, is a political neophyte who would be a shill for the big labor unions that have contributed tens of thousands of dollars to his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Union Joe&quot; proclaims, &quot;I don't worry about being beholden.&quot; Well I do worry about it, Joe, and having another senator under the thumb of &quot;big labor&quot; is the last thing Broomfield and Colorado need. If you follow the money trail, Mr. Whitcomb would also be beholden to Tim Gill and his radical anti-traditional values social agenda. I respect Mr. Whitcomb's military service, but if walking 7,000 miles in four years is a qualification for political service, then my letter carrier is qualified to be governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The choice is clear -- a smart, proven leader like Shawn Mitchell, or a political opportunist bought and paid for by the likes of Tim Gill and the same unions that want to deny workers the simple right not to join these groups. Vote for Shawn Mitchell on Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Kral,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Broomfield</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Time to see past</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama hype</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A ccording to the Democratic campaign propaganda, Barack Obama is a JFK-like idealist who will unite and inspire Americans with his message of hope and change. He will restore our reputation in the world and, incidentally, you can ignore his thin resume because his educational credentials obviously qualify him to be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consider those points individually:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama is reminiscent of JFK -- In the past few years,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Kerry, John Edwards and Bill Clinton have all been compared to President Kennedy. Kennedy comparisons (like Reagan comparisons) are shallow and overused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama is admirable for his idealism -- That idealism is rapidly being compromised. Obama now supports both offshore drilling and an expansion of warrantless surveillance under the FISA legislation. &quot;Health care for everyone&quot; has become &quot;Affordable health care for everyone.&quot; Idealism so readily sacrificed to ambition is not that admirable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama will unite us -- Obama carries precisely the same type of controversial political baggage and history of unyielding partisanship that caused Presidents Bush and Clinton to be so divisive. If John McCain had held his first political fundraiser in the home of someone that bombed an abortion clinic 30 years ago, he would not be welcomed on the left as a uniter. Four years of Barack Obama may make the Bush years seem like a time of reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama offers hope -- Imagine the following campaign slogans. &quot;I sure hope I can get us out of Iraq&quot; or &quot;I hope my administration doesn't make 6 percent unemployment look like the good old days.&quot; Americans should demand more from a presidential candidate than mere hopefulness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama represents change -- The resurrection of 40-year-old taxation and spending policies does not represent change. Nor does a candidate heavily funded by corporate special interests. If you want change, vote for Nader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama will improve our reputation in the world -- Obama does offer hope to the world. To the Europeans it is the hope of an America that is weaker and somewhat ashamed of itself. To Iran, Russia and Al Qaeda it is the hope of an America that refuses to get involved. Anti-Americanism didn't begin with George W. Bush and it won't end with Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama has impressive educational credentials -- Obama's Harvard education allegedly makes him more qualified to be president than McCain's Naval Academy degree. Yet George W. Bush has a degree from Harvard and Jimmy Carter was educated at the Naval Academy. Which of those two would Obama supporters prefer to see returned to the White House?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, hype is used by both sides. Barack Obama is not a closet radical with a hidden anti-American agenda. If elected, he will do his best to improve the lives of Americans. So would John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pro-Obama hype is necessary to distract Americans from the thin resume, the lack of military expertise and the far-left ideology. Don't be fooled by smoke and mirrors. Vote for the candidate that doesn't need the hype. Vote for John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steven Mueller,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Broomfield</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Freedoms should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> always come first</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> W hat country am I living in? Watching Joe the Plumber take a beating from the left and the press for asking Obama a question then accessing his personal information using government computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I, for one, am becoming increasingly disturbed by the Democrats and their agenda to destroy any dissent for one-party rule. They want to bring back the fairness doctrine to put an end to free speech over the radio. Implement net neutrality to silence political speech and citizens rights to assemble over the Internet. They also want to get rid of the secret ballot and use card check and intimidation to unionize workers. Are they going to ban books written by conservatives? Are they going to round up conservatives and place them into concentration camps?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Are we headed for a totalitarian state run by the Democrat party should they have a super majority in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama's character</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not worthy of vote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> W ith 53 percent of Americans on the public dole and a committed Marxist poised to assume power, favoring redistribution of your income, and the first pro-infanticide candidate to run for president, the United States has reached critical mass in its march toward one-party rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nationalization of enormous sectors of the free enterprise system will establish the course of the dialectic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> History has shown no corrective for monopolistic capitalism, nor for the resulting government tyranny and massive concentration of power impoverishing the people, ultimately destroying free markets, private enterprise and individual liberty, i.e., the middle class. Rest assured, however, everyone will be equal in the caste system, equally poor and destitute of civil liberties, save the ruling class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Change&quot; that's coming in Barack Obama's administration:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On country/global citizenship: During presidential campaign -- &quot;As I've said about the flag pin, I don't want to be seen as taking sides. There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression. And the anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all. It should be swapped for something less parochial and less bellicose. I like the song 'I'd like to Teach the World to Sing.' If that were our anthem, then I might salute it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On race/tolerance: From Obama's book, &quot;Dreams of My Father&quot; -- &quot;I ceased to advertise my mother's race at the age of 12 or 13, when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites. ... I found solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against my mother's race. ... It remained necessary to prove which side you were on, to show your loyalty to the black masses, to strike out and name names.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Islam, terrorism and Israel, from Obama's book, &quot;Audacity of Hope&quot; -- &quot;I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama's anti-American allegiances are easily accessible to anyone willing to search for them (www.worldnedaily.com), from Marxist terrorists to anti-semites and pro-Muslim advisers, from the communist organization ACORN to the racist Black Liberation Church, etc. This man will not protect us from our enemies who plot our annihilation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four times Obama voted as an Illinois senator to allow a baby to slowly dehydrate to death after surviving an abortion. (See www.nrlc.org). The brazen immorality of that repeated act sends a chill down your spine. For me, this defines the man, godless and without any objective standard for core values beyond personal prejudice and leftist ideology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consider that the pervasive $600-plus billion media remake of Obama is not the man behind the curtain. He plans to plunge the dialectic sword through the heart of America. This is the choice: &quot;Either be governed by God or, by god, you'll be governed.&quot; (Benjamin Franklin).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for state Senate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I' m a supporter of Joe Whitcomb for the state Senate because, as a substitute science teacher for Boulder Valley, I have a unique vantage point from which to see how money impacts education. I teach in schools in which conditions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are good and materials available, as well as those in which classes are over-crowded and antiquated equipment must be shared. Candidate Whitcomb's recognition that Colorado must raise itself from 49th in the nation in education funding resonates with me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I encourage you to visit Joe Whitcomb's site, www.electjoewhitcomb.com, to find out about his stances on the environment and health care, and from which you can ask questions about concerns you have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Please join me in supporting Joe Whitcomb for state Senate District 23.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama inspires</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> across the globe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (T he following is an excerpt from Broomfield High School graduate and Peace Corps volunteer Dan Carr's blog from Malawi, Africa.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was in Lilongwe, Africa, during the nomination of Barack Obama to be the Democratic candidate for president. I have never seen a political candidate in my lifetime with as much potential to change the world, and I'm so happy to see so many people in America see the same thing in Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have also never seen a candidate that has such an effect on the American public, it seems like he has mobilized and energized my generation in a way I would have thought was impossible three years ago. He's bringing out people that never even thought about voting, and making passionate believers of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six months ago, everybody around my village just laughed at me when I held up my copy of &quot;Dreams From My Father&quot; to show them the picture of the man who I think will be my next president. Everybody, except for Vincent Mpese</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gondwe, a retired member of Parliament that lives in Bolero, who has become a very close friend of mine. This incredible man has seen the darkest days of Malawian politics, which he still bears in the form of scars on his head from when an attempt was made on his life for making a bold vote in Parliament. He also saw the darkest days in American politics as a student at Harvard in the early 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Obama first won the primary in Iowa, I rode my bike to Vincent's house to share the good news. Mr. Gondwe was chuckling as he said, &quot;Daniel I tell you, if that man is sworn in as the American president then all of Africa will change the way it looks at your country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now everybody in my village believes in the possibility of a black man leading America, and changing the world. When they walk into my house and see his picture hanging on my wall under a huge American flag I inherited from another volunteer, they say his name with the same deliberate hopefulness in their voice that that woman had the other day .... Oh-Ba-Ma. I'm proud to be a representative of America, and am all too happy to sit down with anybody who will listen and start ranting about this man who I believe has the life experience to understand the world in a way no previous American president has, and the eloquence to relate that understanding to all American public as a whole, and the integrity to use all that influence to help us find a better way in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'm so proud to see the excitement of a growing movement in America. But I would be most proud to say that I served as a Peace Corps volunteer under President Barack Obama's administration. Let's make that happen now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Economic Robin Hood plan has some holes in it,&quot; Oct. 19 Perspective article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chuck Plunkett offers a reasoned analysis of the presidential candidates' income tax policies. There are fundamental flaws in Barack Obama's tax and economic plans, which conflict with the American work ethic that drives our nation's success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expanding the discussion beyond income taxes, you get an even broader picture. In addition to the income tax increase on &quot;the wealthy,&quot; Obama will raise the Social Security tax, with no benefit increase. Throw in his increase in the capital gains tax and Laffer may be laughing again. Beyond Joe the Plumber, consider millions of middle class professionals who get caught in Sen. Obama's net, wondering why they should strive beyond some arbitrary level when each dollar earned becomes something like 40 cents. Obama clearly intends to take their money and give it away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My grandparents arrived in America as poor immigrants, but they understood incentive as well as Laffer himself. They instilled in their children the ideal that hard work brings a better life and personal freedom. They never dreamed of asking for handouts at the expense of other Americans' earnings. They knew their children would be successful, and wouldn't have jeopardized their children's futures, and their own independence, for a pittance of a handout for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard V. DiMeo, Evergreen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign claims that Barack Obama's plan to reverse the Bush tax cuts for the very wealthy, while giving tax cuts for those making under $200,000 per year, is &quot;socialism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1980, the average income of the top 1 percent of American wage earners has more than doubled, while the average income for the bottom 90 percent of American wage earners has been stagnant (in real dollars corrected for inflation). This concentration of wealth in the hands of a few has been facilitated by tax policies that heavily favor the wealthy, including various loopholes and tax shelters. John McCain also ignores the fact that payroll, sales and other taxes disproportionately affect the working class and poor. Even Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest Americans, considers it unfair that his effective tax rate is lower than that of his secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite McCain's claims to the contrary, half of the corporations in the U.S. find ways to avoid paying federal corporate taxes. There's nothing Robin Hood-esque about Obama's plan; it simply restores fairness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---------------------------------------- Good and evil too simple</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;The pilot and the wizard,&quot; Oct. 19 John Andrews column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was once a good, decent man who could do no evil; and an evil, selfish man who could do no good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Andrews often relies on this formula for his columns. But while the formula works well as a template for children's fables, there are reasons why it is not so effective for adults, chief of which is that it glosses over the complexity of human nature, particularly as applied to politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More troubling, however, is that Mr. Andrews relies on &quot;truths&quot; which he considers self-evident but that are far from being so: John McCain the maverick senator and Barack Obama the Chicago hustler, to name just two. If Mr. Andrews were a campaign spokesman or writing for a publication with an explicit and extreme political agenda, his shorthand arguments would come as no surprise. But regardless of the individuals or issues I support in a particular election, I expect Denver Post writers - including editorialists - to dig a bit deeper than empty slogans and actually contribute meaningful ideas and perspectives to a debate. Op-ed pieces such as &quot;The pilot and the wizard&quot; fall far short of that standard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's record as pilot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Andrews asks us to consider John McCain as &quot;the Pilot,&quot; and I agree with his allegory. His column concludes with the statement, &quot;Trust the Pilot, America.&quot; The pilot metaphor, however, requires that we actually analyze McCain's military record as a pilot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his Navy career, Pilot McCain expensively lost five military aircraft - in 1958, 1960, 1965, July 1967, and finally October 1967. I am a member of a military family of pilots. I honor and respect McCain's service to his country. Good pilots are calm in crisis, even-tempered, organized and deliberate. None of these words describe McCain, as demonstrated by his erratic behavior during the recent financial crisis and bailout. As a patriot, I must reject him as a potential pilot at the controls of our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I applaud Mr. Andrews for bringing this comparison to our attention, but I come to a different conclusion. Can we trust McCain in the cockpit we call the Oval Office, based on his past record as a pilot?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---------------------------------------- Whose plan is best?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's plan works</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Prescription for health care reform,&quot; Oct. 19 Perspective articles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alicia Caldwell misrepresented the McCain health care plan by implying that the $5,000 tax credit provided by the plan would be inadequate to cover the $12,000 average cost of a family insurance policy. A very important ingredient was left out of this calculation: the employer's contribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain plan is designed to cover two possibilities:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. If the employer continues to provide the health insurance benefit by paying, say, $8,000 of the total $12,000 cost, the employee would have the $5,000 tax credit to cover his $4,000 portion of the cost of the policy plus the additional income tax due on the no longer tax-free $8,000 of benefit income. No problem here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. If, on the other hand, the employer decided to discontinue the health insurance benefit, the employee would receive the $8,000 as additional taxable take-home pay. Then, under the McCain plan, the employee would have the $5,000 tax credit to cover the additional $4,000 needed to purchase a fully mobile $12,000 health policy and the additional income tax on the no longer tax-free $8,000 of income. In both cases, any funds left over could be invested in a health savings account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sounds like a good plan to me.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A commodity, not a right</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Health care a right for all Americans,&quot; Oct. 19 Perspective article by Sen. Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama's claim that health care is a &quot;right&quot; typifies a dangerous political trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A right is a freedom of action (such as the right to free speech), not an automatic claim to a good or service that must be produced by another. Attempting to guarantee a supposed &quot;right&quot; to health care must necessarily violate actual rights of providers or of citizens forced to pay for others' medical expenses. This is just state-sanctioned slavery or theft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of another massive government program to guarantee &quot;universal health care,&quot; we need free-market reforms that would allow individuals to purchase health insurance across state lines, use Health Savings Accounts for routine expenses, and purchase inexpensive catastrophic-only policies for rare but expensive problems. Such reforms could cut costs by as much as 50 percent, making quality health insurance affordable to many who want to purchase it but currently can't.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grateful for Medicare</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Power to choose belongs to citizens,&quot; Oct. 19 Perspective article by John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain has yet again explained his ultra-conservative mantra about his health care &quot;plan&quot; as follows: &quot;The key is allowing Americans to choose the coverage that best meets their needs ... . This power belongs to the people and should not be given to government bureaucrats or insurance companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not the bureaucrats but the Washington politicians (like McCain) who are the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am 80 years old and have benefited from Medicare for the last 10 years. I am very grateful for the government (Medicare) to have come between me and my physicians. Quality health care will only come from the government, not from insurance companies or the drug industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain must be dreaming when he assumes that &quot;healthy competition&quot; will self-regulate drug prices. The same American-made drug that may cost $100 in the USA will be available for $50 in Canada, Great Britain, France and Germany, and may cost as little as $20 in Greece and Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ted Kramer, Fort Collins ---------------------------------------- To The Point</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worldwide money panic has featured extraordinary expressions of cooperation and trust among financial leaders of most nations. The question remains: Was this a significant step toward world unity and recovery, or a rare moment of honor among thieves?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Davoren, Denver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal government is on a roll with the bailouts. Of course, one group can never be bailed out: taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Devanter, Wheat Ridge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find it amusing how quickly Democrats become staunch property-rights supporters once it is their own Obama signs being stolen from their front lawns. If only this indignation was permanent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Schow, Englewood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than having mail-in voting and early voting, wouldn't it be better to have several consecutive days early in November to accomodate long lines at the polls? How many people who cast their votes too early are regretting it now, for example, that Obama has dropped his &quot;spread the wealth&quot; bomb?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cathy Swartwood, Morrison</SPAN></P>

John McCain has yet again explained his ultra-conservative mantra about his health care &quot;plan&quot; as follows: &quot;The key is allowing Americans to choose the coverage that best meets their needs ... . This power belongs to the people and should not be given to government bureaucrats or insurance companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not the bureaucrats but the Washington politicians (like McCain) who are the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am 80 years old and have benefited from Medicare for the last 10 years. I am very grateful for the government (Medicare) to have come between me and my physicians. Quality health care will only come from the government, not from insurance companies or the drug industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain must be dreaming when he assumes that &quot;healthy competition&quot; will self-regulate drug prices. The same American-made drug that may cost $100 in the USA will be available for $50 in Canada, Great Britain, France and Germany, and may cost as little as $20 in Greece and Turkey.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, here we go again! Just as in the 2006 election, I'm being innundated by calls from only the Republicans. Not only are they annoying, they come in on my cellphone - so I have to pay for the call. I, like many others, only use a cellphone, so I have no choice but to accept the calls (I have kids, so not answering is not an option).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have asked to be removed from the call list, and the national organization was able to comply. The state organization's response was to tell me that my call to them cost more than the robocall, so there. The representative was proud of his retort to my complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a good thing Joe the Plumber is voting for John McCain, because I won't. This reinforces my opinion that the Republicans are really more interested in the fat cats than they are in the average person. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop's comments on Obama and abortion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Chaput blasts Obama, supporters on abortion,&quot; Oct. 19 news story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Catholics and supporters of Sen. Barack Obama's candidacy, we appreciate Archbishop Charles Chaput's clarification in Sunday's Post that he is speaking as a private citizen when he takes issue with Sen. Obama and his supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had supposed that since the official archdiocesan newspaper last week included a voter guide supporting John McCain from a group calling itself Colorado Family Institute (different from the guide promoted by the U.S. bishops), the archbishop might, perhaps, be attempting to influence the choices of Catholic voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We honor the archbishop's right to support the candidates and issues he believes best represent his deepest values, and applaud his recognition that not all Catholics will make his choices their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also appreciate the respect for primacy of conscience in our decision-making, as enunciated by Josef Ratzinger, now our current pope, Benedict XVI, who wrote: &quot;Over the pope, as the expression of the binding claim of ecclesiastical authority, there still stands one's own conscience, which must be obeyed before all else - if necessary, even against the requirement of ecclesiastical authority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are making our ballot choices as adults and as faithful citizens who have weighed the issues in light of the gospels and the justice teachings of our church. We encourage all Catholics to do likewise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sister Mary A. Coyle, Denver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sister Mary Ann Cunningham, Denver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catholic dogma requires that Catholics protect life, but that teaching includes all life, as in the seamless cloak of life conceptualized by Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago. This is the all-inclusive concept of life embraced by many Catholics. Your article called us the &quot;voices on the Catholic left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Catholic's call to protect life does not need legislation. I consider myself a good Catholic if I march for peace, if I work to stem the root causes of abortion, such as violence, ignorance and poverty, and even when I write a letter to protest injustice. Roe vs. Wade says a woman has a legal right to abortion. With my free will and God-given intellect, I can support a woman's right to choose an abortion while working to end the need for abortion. That seems more Christian and takes the politics out of the abortion debate. Archbishop Chaput, when will you stand up for all life issues and stop advising Catholics to support war-mongering candidates just because they want to overturn Roe vs. Wade?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we base our vote on one issue (abortion), we are ignoring the greater call to protect all life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diane J. Mayer, Englewood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attending parochial schools in the '40s and '50s I believed everything the nuns and priests told me. Even the idea that unbaptized babies went to a place called limbo became part of my faith. Archbishop Chaput now tells us that a fertilized egg is an actual person. Does this mean if the fertilized egg is naturally dislodged from an unfortunate woman's body, it will go to limbo?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So my Sundays are now spent watching TV news shows and reading. The money I used to throw into the collection plate is well-spent fostering a little girl in India and one in Brazil. Not only am I giving them a chance for a better life, but they help me immensely: they don't tell me how to vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This lucky elderly lady of 80 has cast her vote by mail. By adding three sticky stamps that give my precious vote value, I trust that our faithful postal service will deliver my ballot with a sea of other votes at the election department to be counted by a reliable clerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have voted for presidents who were good, bad and corrupt. Lived through many presidents. Gone through depressions, recessions and wars. But I still believe that my one precious vote will count.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In defense of comments on Jeffco ballot notice Re: &quot;Jeffco nets ire from 'satire,&quot;' Oct. 14 news story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an opponent of Jefferson County Schools' massive tax increase, ballot items 3A/3B, I submitted a statement for the election notice. TABOR laws require the district to publish and distribute notices to every voter household. A summary of &quot;pro&quot; and &quot;con&quot; comments are included, so voters have information and opinions to help make decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Absurd ballot questions deserve responses, including satire, if necessary for emphasis. The district claimed that the notice had already been submitted by a political action committee, and mine wasn't needed. I insisted, referring to the law. I have been demonized and called a saboteur by big tax advocates. There are no such complaints when the districts write their own false pro and con statements. There's no complaint about the political action committee's press release cruelly implying a connection between 3A and homestead-exemption eligibility. No complaint about the misrepresentation that &quot;3A/3B increases property values.&quot; One PAC is chaired by two very liberal politicians, and another spent hundreds of thousands, funded by five-digit contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seniors don't have the money to fight measures masquerading as &quot;for the children&quot; and the &quot;It's only a few dollars per month&quot; argument. A $34 million increase yearly, with no sunset provision, plus $754 million in bonds, isn't a few dollars. They ignore the other hands in our pockets, such as RTD's 67 percent tax increase, now wanting another 30 percent on top of that, to fund their no-bid contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school people are astounded when someone has the brass to oppose their demands. We're for the children too, but we can't afford to lose our homes for some more gold plating. With the leftists in charge locally as well as nationally, taking billions out of the economy, who do we turn to?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopefully this controversy points out that we seniors are taxed out, and spending will have to wait.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silky rhetoric and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic socialism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Barack Obama and Mark Udall have voting records well to the left of mainstream Colorado, but the silky rhetoric of their campaign commercials obfuscates those records. Because of this, a new generation of naive, young voters will probably move us closer to socialism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In time, those same young voters may come to regret their votes and appreciate the wisdom of Milton Friedman: &quot;History suggests that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pproximately 900 people assembled in the Glenn Miller Ballroom of the University Memorial Center at the University of Colorado Wednesday night to hear third-party presidential candidate Ralph Nader offer his take on the economy, the war in Iraq, and the effects of the two-party political system on the democratic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two-party system is rigged . . . and near the end of its day,&quot; said Nader, stating that if the oppressive tactics of the two-party political system were applied to the free market, the system would be subject to prosecution as a monopoly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nader charged that both major-party candidates John McCain and Barack Obama have been corrupted by the huge sums of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> money they have received from corporations to fund their campaigns. He also argued that voting in line with that system shifts the power of the democratic process out of the hands of everyday voters and into the hands of corporations and our nation's wealthiest one percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is not a single reference to corporations in our Constitution. Not one. There is not a single reference to a political party in our Constitution,&quot; said Nader. &quot;Then why are we controlled by corporations and their political indentured servants?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the veteran activist arrived nearly an hour later than expected due to aircraft problems, the crowd remained engaged and enthusiastic over the course of his speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was happy to hear everything that Mr. Nader had to say -- I think he is a brilliant speaker and a revolutionary thinker,&quot; said Kristin Gornstein, a recent CU grad. &quot;I am a firm believer in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> need for more than two parties in our political system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though the audience was composed of many Boulderites, the student population was well-represented as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm here to get a perspective on Nader as a person and his policies as a candidate,&quot; said Nick Collins, a CU freshman. &quot;I think it's really cool to have the opportunity to see Ralph Nader on the CU campus. I like to have as much knowledge on the presidential candidates as I can before I vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nader also put forth several higher-education policy ideas during a press conference before his speech, including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --&quot;Abolish commercial student loan corporations,&quot; to keep them from price-gouging and relying on the government to pay them in cases in which people default.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --&quot;Expand student loans&quot; to make them more affordable and easier to get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --&quot;Make university budgets more transparent,&quot; so that the public can know how the funds are being used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --&quot;Put contracts between universities and corporations online,&quot; so that scholars and taxpayer groups can examine them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --&quot;Strive for free tuition,&quot; stating that if &quot;Italy, Luxembourg,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Finland can do it, then the richest country in the world can do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --Provide students with more &quot;opportunities to develop civic skills,&quot; so that they can practice the democratic process the way other students practice their studies in laboratories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though Nader's address covered a number of issues, he continued to drive home his stance on the importance of opening up the political process to more than two parties and taking the power back from the corporations that, in his opinion, control the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Constitution says 'We the people,'&quot; said Nader, &quot;Not 'We the corporations.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite assertions that it was not cutting back on resources in the state, John McCain's presidential campaign has drastically slashed television advertising at Colorado's big three stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, national Republicans have canceled $600,000 worth of ads supporting incumbent GOP Rep. Marilyn Musgrave's re-election bid. And the campaign arm of Senate Democrats pulled out of the Mark Udall-Bob Schaffer race, where recent polls show Udall, a Democrat, with a wide lead. Colorado's days as a battleground state for the Nov. 4 election may be waning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who trails Barack Obama by an average of 5 percentage points in Colorado polls, this week bought a total of $305,550 worth of ads at KUSA-Channel 9, KCNC-Channel 4 and KMGH-Channel 7, according to records. That is a 46 percent decrease from the week before and a 56 percent slide from two weeks ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the final eight days of the campaign season, McCain has purchased a little more than $50,000 of ad time at Channel 4 and $67,000 at Channel 9, which is watched by 40 percent of the market. McCain had not purchased ad time for those days at Channel 7 as of Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By comparison, Obama has purchased more than $500,000 worth of advertising at Channel 4 and Channel 9 for the final week. Add on the $287,700 he has laid out for ads at Channel 7, and it's nearly seven times what McCain is spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigns often adjust their advertising buys based on priorities and can subtract or add, as long as the stations have slots available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What this means is that the McCain campaign has sparse resources and is beginning to write places off,&quot; said Jennifer Duffy, managing editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. &quot;Colorado polling is consistently looking bad for McCain. So it doesn't surprise me that they are putting their resources elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain opted to receive public financing, which totaled $84 million post-convention. Obama opted out and raised $150 million for just the month of September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of both the local and national McCain campaign have repeatedly denied they would - or did - shift or cut back on resources, including ads, in Colorado. When asked about the drop at the three stations Wednesday, Tom Kise, spokesman for the campaign, refused to answer the question and instead discussed the ads themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not pulling ads and will be on the air in Colorado through Election Day. While we won't be discussing specifics of any buy, we reserve the right, like all campaigns do, including the Obama camp, to make strategic moves on a daily basis with our paid media efforts,&quot; Kise said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of the ad situation, McCain himself will be in Colorado on Friday, campaigning in Denver and Durango. Obama will be in Denver on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musgrave airtime pulled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's ads were bought either by his campaign or his victory committee, which includes money from the Republican National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On its own, the RNC has targeted Colorado, as well Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, for advertising. This week the RNC is spending just under $500,000 in support of McCain, but the campaigns are prohibited from coordinating with each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Colorado's closest-watched congressional race, the National Republican Congressional Committee pulled about $600,000 worth of airtime set aside to support Musgrave's race for the 4th Congressional District. Musgrave is running against Democrat Betsy Markey in a district that includes Fort Collins and Greeley. While there have been no recent public polls on the race, political crystal-ball readers put Markey ahead..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Musgrave campaign reported $798,000 on hand as of Sept. 30, while the Markey campaign reported $382,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DSCC confident of Udall race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee will stop running ads targeting Colorado's open Senate seat, state Democratic sources said Wednesday. The withdrawal signals that the group believes Udall is comfortably ahead of Schaffer in the race and can shift its money to other competitive races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the vote of confidence by national Democrats, Udall's campaign said it wasn't happy with the retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think that outside GOP groups will see this as an opportunity to launch more mean-spirited attack ads against Mark,&quot; Udall spokesman Tara Trujillo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dick Wadhams, head of Schaffer's campaign, said the move was typical of Democrats being &quot;cocky&quot; and &quot;arrogant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff writers Mike Riley and Jessica Fender contributed to this report.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If John McCain and the GOP are planning to cede Colorado to Democrat Barack Obama, they sure have a funny way of showing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only is the Republican National Committee's independent expenditure arm targeting the state with big ad buys, but McCain - who will be flooding the airwaves here through Election Day, his campaign said - is slated to make three campaign stops in Colorado Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's visit comes on the heels of three appearances in the state earlier this week by his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Her husband, Todd, visited Colorado on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is fighting to win Colorado. Just look at where the campaign is sending the candidates,&quot; said Christian Ferry, McCain's deputy campaign manager. &quot;We have a very strong campaign there, and reports that we aren't fighting to win is hogwash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing two anonymous McCain &quot;strategists and advisers,&quot; CNN reported Monday that the McCain campaign saw its chances of winning Colorado (and Iowa and New Mexico) as &quot;bleak&quot; and was looking for ways to win the election without Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the RNC independent arm, which is not bound by spending limits, has put Colorado on its target list, spokesman Brad Todd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group is spending more than $18 million for advertising in seven states - Colorado, Missouri, Indiana, Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania - to run through Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can anyone say we're going anywhere? We're spending a boatload of money in Colorado,&quot; said Frank Donatelli, the RNC's deputy chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama currently leads McCain in Colorado by an average of 5 percentage points, according to recent polls.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 15 days left in the presidential race, Republican John McCain is struggling to hold on to Colorado and a handful of critical red states that President Bush took four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator, saddled with an unpopular president and a tumbling economy, finds himself in the precarious position of trailing Democrat Barack Obama by an average of 6 percentage points in a state that has backed only one Democratic presidential candidate in the past 40 years. His running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, is campaigning today in Colorado Springs, Loveland and Grand Junction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political climate, along with a number of other factors, including Obama's steady performances in three debates and McCain's choice of conservative Palin, is dragging McCain down in Colorado, some political observers say, primarily because of the state's moderate, unaffiliated voters, who now narrowly edge out registered Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The race is still too close to call, especially because Obama is considered a liberal and Colorado voters don't easily digest liberals,&quot; said Tom Cronin, a political-science professor at Colorado College who has studied the Interior West's voting behavior for four decades. &quot;But many of these independent voters are looking for a definitive change. And McCain hasn't helped himself very much in that area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, the GOP is suffering from a huge voter-registration loss. The 180,000-voter edge Republicans had over Democrats four years ago has whittled down to fewer than 50,000, according to registration numbers through September. Whether new or unaffiliated voters - who rarely lean toward a candidate en masse - turn out for Obama remains to be seen. But the Illinois senator has 51 offices in the state devoted to get-out-the-vote efforts, whereas McCain has 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, acknowledges that the &quot;mass financial global collapse&quot; and the &quot;most unpopular president since Nixon&quot; have hamstrung his candidate's move forward. But, he said, there are still a significant number of undecided voters in Colorado and other states, and they, along with independents, are swayed not by Obama's &quot;big government&quot; message but by McCain's traditional federalist approach to finding solutions without government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are very steadily chipping away at undecided voters with our message,&quot; Davis said. &quot;Obama has tried to declare the election's over. But John McCain closes extremely well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As many as 5 percent of Colorado voters are undecided, according to recent polls, and while Obama has a significant lead among unaffiliated voters, a Rasmussen Reports poll two weeks ago found that a third of Colorado's unaffiliated voters said they could change their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis pointed out that McCain is fighting hard for Colorado. In addition to Palin's stops today, McCain is scheduled to be in Colorado on Friday, although no further details have been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, however, isn't letting up either. His running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, is slated to campaign here Tuesday and Wednesday. And Obama will make another visit to the state before the election, said Jim Messina, his chief of staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's strategy in the state, which started during the primary, has specifically targeted new and unaffiliated voters through repeated door-to-door visits, mail and calls, as well as having a highly visible grassroots operation that has saturated the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The best defense is a good offense,&quot; Messina said. &quot;We've always said that if people could meet or talk to (Obama), we would win. Our field organization is an extension of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, McCain has been forced to defend red states - such as Colorado, Virginia, North Carolina, Indiana and Ohio - where Obama has been making inroads. At the same time, a host of polls indicate McCain faces serious challenges in picking off any blue states that went for Democrat John Kerry four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even as McCain battles to hold on to traditional GOP states, Obama - who has a massive financial advantage because he opted out of public financing - is actively trying to pull them away, even increasing voter mobilization and ad buys in West Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida, which once appeared squarely in McCain's column, has become a hard-fought contest, primarily because of the economy, said Dan Smith, a University of Florida political-science professor. McCain is forced to spend dwindling time and money to try to capture the state's 27 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain cannot lose Florida,&quot; Smith said. &quot;If he does, it's over.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans to blame for ills</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have been criticized several times for my &quot;leftist&quot; letters. I have found that an open-door Democrat in a heavily Republican community will constantly be harassed and insulted. Sometimes they act more like gang members rather that real Americans. It's no wonder we have so many closet Democrats in Broomfield. But I still believe in the First Amendment. I will be heard, or read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently Tom J. Lloyd and others have said I had a discredited source in the IQ of Bush and Clinton. However, none have ever verified what their real IQs really were. Were they afraid my statistics were really close or accurate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I follow sources I get from Time, Newsweek, The Denver Post and, yes, the Internet. How do we know that Snopes isn't a Republican operated Web site any more than some people claim the Denver Post and Time are leftist? Or Rush Limbaugh is far right? In an earlier letter I quoted statistics from Newsweek and Time magazine. I was criticized by claiming I had liberal socialistic tendencies by merely quoting from those magazines the percentage of Americans who were complaining about lack of health care and day care. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tom J. Lloyd stated I should think for myself. You're right Tom. I usually write what I think myself, but no one wants to believe it until they see it later for real or in the news. I predicted Bush was lying about Iraq and he was ruining the country four years ago, but your people considered what I said &quot;a dogmatic leftist vitriolic writing.&quot; Here is something you can't disagree with, leftist or real, mainly because of this Republican administration America is in the tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Americans were lied to about Iraq. More than 4,170 American soldiers have died, more than 30,000 seriously wounded, more than 125,000 Iraqis dead (check &quot;snopes&quot;). And we now have, if we include the $700 billion payout, more than $11 trillion in national debt. That is more than $36,184 for each person in the United States, including children, illegals, etc. etc. We are mistrusted and disliked by most countries in South America, the Middle East and Europe. We do have a few allies, but they don't really trust us and pretend so they can get our protection and aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our education system is about 14th in the world. We have a 30 percent high school dropout rate. We have 47 million without health insurance, we have more than 27 million Americans living below the poverty level. We have more than 5,000 gun deaths a year. Please, Please, look it up and write us all another letter quoting the more real recent statistics from Snopes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We had the best country in the whole world, and it is being ruined by the current Republican administration who has had the tiller for the last eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Do we want more of the same with McCain?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leonard Muniz,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Broomfield</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amendment 48</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a bad idea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A s my girlfriend and I made the final, steep ascent over the boulders to the summit of Bear Peak she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> turned to me and asked, &quot;So when I eat a plate of scrambled eggs, am I technically eating a chicken?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Right,&quot; we both laughed, enjoying the panoramic views spread out in front of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We were, of course, talking about the ridiculous Amendment 48 on November's ballot seeking to grant &quot;personhood&quot; to a zygote. The amendment defines person to include any human being from the moment of fertilization. Yes. That's right: Equal protection under the law for an embryo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like my hiking friend, I consider myself pro-life and pro-choice. But this proposed amendment is too over-the-top. If passed, we stand to see birth control pills and IUDs, for example, outlawed because they can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. This &quot;Personhood Amendment&quot; as it is called, is a spectacular act of complicity designed to confuse and muddle so many issues. The unintended consequences of this hasty and ill-thought proposal are staggering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If this amendment is approved, it would apply the definition of &quot;person&quot; to sections of the Colorado constitution regarding equality of justice, due process of law and inalienable rights to a fetus. Fertilization will be the new starting point of equal rights and privileges for everyone from the unborn to senior citizens. This arcane amendment would ultimately end up costing taxpayers thousands of dollars, clogging up courts, impacting laws ranging from when property and inheritance rights are recognized to birth control and health care. Think about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In anticipation of possible approval of this measure, consider the deep effects that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would hamper in-vitro fertilization, stem cell research and effectively ban birth control. Imagine being a rape victim and being denied access to emergency, day-after contraceptives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kristi Burton, the home-schooled 20-year-old sponsor of the amendment, suggests playing word games with women's health. She founded what she calls Colorado for Equal Rights, and created the first constitutional amendment of its kind in the country and succeeded in gathering enough signatures to get it on the November ballot. And she deserves credit. But I know Colorado voters are much brighter than she suspects and clearly will not support this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amendment 48 is wrong not only because it is too extreme. Its basic premise that fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses are human persons deserving all of the legal rights and moral standing as an infant is wrong. Even my most conservative colleagues see the trouble with that premise. So on our way back down the mountain, my friend turned to me and asked another question. &quot;If Amendment 48 passes, how many passports does a pregnant woman carry when she travels?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hmmmmm. We laughed again. &quot;Maybe three if she's carrying twins.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Now is a great time to make just a few simple changes so you can significantly reduce your energy usage and costs. Gov. Ritter proclaimed October</SPAN></P>

Try these easy no-cost energy savings tips: First, set your thermostat to 68 degrees and save around 10 percent a year on your heating. Also, set your water heater to 120 degrees. Next, make the most of Mother Nature's sunlight by opening window coverings on south-facing windows to warm your home. If you have large windows that don't receive direct sun, keep the drapes closed. Finally, when washing clothes, use cold water; 85 to 90 percent of the energy used to wash your clothes is used to heat the water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following low-cost tips will give you an incredible return on your small investment: Be sure to replace your furnace or heat pump filter regularly. Next, install water-efficient showerheads and faucets. Low-flow shower heads also are a worthwhile investment that will reduce the amount of hot water you use, and hence the energy needed to heat it. Also, switch to compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs. These bulbs provide as much light as regular incandescent bulbs while using just one-fourth the energy. Finally, save up to 10 percent on your energy bill by weather-stripping doors and sealing windows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although it may take some extra money and time on your part, the following tips will go a big way in making your home energy efficient: A large amount of heat is lost from un-insulated homes, so be sure to properly insulate your home. Insulating ceilings, walls, attics, floors, crawl spaces and basements to recommended standards can reduce heating and cooling costs by 5 to 25</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vets' endorsement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T his Nov. 4, the voters of Senate District 23 are presented with a unique opportunity to elect competent, professional representation in Joe Whitcomb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joe Whitcomb is a brave American who has twice answered his country's call to serve -- in the United States Army as an Ranger who parachuted into Panama to assist in liberating that country from the narcoterrorist regime of Manuel Noriega, and then after 9/11, when he re-enlisted to once again defend our freedoms and way of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joe is a committed family man and community leader as evidenced by his involvement in providing legal services and advice to victims of domestic violence and mentoring at risk youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CVA believes the families,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business community and veterans of Senate District 23 will be served well with Joe Whitcomb in the state Senate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jesus would not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> endorse Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I n the Oct. 5 paper, the faith section columnists were asked the question, who would Jesus vote for and why? I found this topic inappropriate and offensive; it is not something I expect to see in my hometown paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I appreciated that the Rev. Charles Reeder's column suggested that after you have humbly submitted yourself to God you could then question which candidate's heart is most conformed to his. Mr. Rudland, on the other hand, stated that Jesus was a community organizer just like Obama and that alone shows Obama's intent to bring justice back into this world. I find this comparison ludicrous. The community that Jesus organized was his apostles and disciples who formed his church. The same church that today, as it has for more than 2,000 years, values human life. According to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, &quot;Since its beginnings, Christianity has maintained a firm and clear teaching on the sacredness of human life. Jesus Christ emphasized this in his teaching and ministry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his recent book &quot;Render unto Caesar,&quot; Archbishop Charles J. Chaput writes &quot;My friends often ask me if Catholics in genuinely good conscience can vote for 'pro-choice' candidates. The answer is: I couldn't. Supporting a 'right' to choose abortion simply masks and evades what abortion is: the deliberate killing of innocent life. I know of nothing that can morally offset that kind of evil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I find it very hard to believe Jesus would vote for a man that has a 100 percent NARAL rating and has stated that the first thing he would do as president is sign the Freedom of Choice Act, in a speech to abortion advocates worried about the increase of pro-life</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> legislation at the state level. The Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA) is legislation Obama has co-sponsored along with 18 other senators that would annihilate every single state law limiting or regulating abortion, including the federal ban on partial birth abortion. The Born Alive Infants Protection Act (BAIPA) was signed into federal law in 2002. The bill protects infants who are born alive after botched abortions. Prior to 2002, Obama voted against the state version three times. Sen. Obama is also quoted as saying &quot;Look, I got two daughters -- 9 years old and 6 years old,&quot; he said. &quot;I am going to teach them first about values and morals, but if they make a mistake, I don't want them punished with a baby. I don't want them punished with an STD at age 16, so it doesn't make sense to not give them information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I could go on with many other examples of how Sen. Obama is pro-death and that is something the Jesus I know and love would never support.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Volunteer with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> elders, enrich life</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have been working at Broomfield Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center for a little over three months now. I entered this field through volunteer work. When I became employed at the Broomfield Skilled, I began to realize I was going to be paid to work for people who were living in the &quot;old age&quot; stage of life. I started to go home at night and ponder what it really meant to be an elder and why I found this line of work so rewarding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I felt enriched when I became a volunteer for elders because I was saturated in wisdom, experience and a deep sense of history. I did not grow up surrounded with very much family. I was short of grandparents and other older relatives who could share their experience, strength and hope of how to live life. I do not feel short of family now. I have a deep respect for the people I work for and feel compelled to inspire others to discover the reward of working with elders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The thing about aging is all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of us will do it. The only difference between the elders I volunteered for and me is they have more time and experience in life than I do. After I began volunteering I asked myself what it meant to be in &quot;old age.&quot; What is the value of aging? How do I want to live when and if I ever move to a nursing home later on in my life? What do I hope the people who work around and for me will feel about old age when I become an elder? For me, I do not leave my experience of working with elders feeling drained and empty. I leave the experience feeling filled up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am 30 years old. I have been through a divorce, the death of my father and the experience of having and raising a child for five years. Some would say that was a lot for 30 years. Every day I talk and interact with the elders at Broomfield Skilled Nursing, I am humbled by all that time has showed them about life. Life still has much to show me. Life can be hard. Life can be scary. Life can be rewarding beyond all measure. How do I know this? I work with elders. They teach me that if I keep going, whether it is through a world war or a disappointment life has handed me, I will make it. I am honored to be a part of these elder's lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How do you feel about elders in our community?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Broomfield Skilled is always looking for enthusiastic people to volunteer. There are many areas to become a part of. We need your talents and your hearts. We are all a part of this community together. Come volunteer and feel a part of something great! Help enrich your life by enriching the lives of our elders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amend. 48 step</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in wrong direction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T he other day I finally opened up our voter's blue book. After a quick perusal of the measures, I thought that Amendment 48, Definition of a Person, would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> be a fun one with which to start. Oh the horror, the horror. An obvious attempt to outlaw abortion, this measure goes way too far. It would not only outlaw abortion in cases of rape, incest and threat to mother's life, it would also outlaw most contraception -- including the pill. The net effect of increased unintended and unwanted pregnancies in the state of Colorado would be a burden on all parts of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for women's rights, we would be stepping back to the dark ages. A woman should have the right to choose what is best for herself and her fetus. By defining a person &quot;to include any human being from the moment of fertilization&quot; and applying it to the Colorado Constitution, one must ask who is really thinking for that brainless/organless single cell -- mom or government? In order to not throw women's health rights back into the closet, with the coat hangers, we must all continue down the ballot after we vote for the president of our choice, and vote no on Amendment 48.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T he current presidential election is undoubtedly one of the most important of our lifetimes. I would encourage everyone to get involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Discussing the candidates with an old high school buddy, who lives in Oklahoma, I indicated my preference. He likes the other candidate and suggested tat we just let our votes cancel each other. I explained to him it doesn't work that way. Presidential elections are won state by state. Oklahoma is a given for the Republican candidate, so his vote won't really matter. Colorado is in play this time, so my vote could literally determine who becomes the next president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the outcome of this election matters to you, do something. Make a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am supporting Barack Obama because I do not think our country would be well served by continuing the failed policies of the Bush administration, which is what</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Starin is right</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> choice for 2nd CD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I t's a shame this newspaper has paid so little attention to the candidacy of Scott Starin who is running for the U.S. House of Representatives, 2nd Congressional District. His opponent, who is independently wealthy, spent more than $4 million to win the primary. He is so comfortable in the 2nd CD Democratic heritage, that he has hardly spent a cent and has shown up at very few events since the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For those of your readers who don't know Scott, he is an aerospace engineer and scientist who has worked on many pioneering developments in sustainable energy production for NASA. He works full time while running for the 2nd CD seat and relies on contributions to fund his campaign. He is unable to buy the election, as is his opponent. He is out there meeting Republicans and Democrats alike with his message. He will work in a bipartisan way to solve the gridlock in Washington. If ever there was a person who is ideally suited to help lead this country to energy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> independence, Scott Starin is the one. He is familiar with and an advocate for various alternative energy technologies. He will fight to use all approaches available to make our country energy independent and bring down the price of oil, thus ensuring our national security. Whether you are a Republican, Democrat or independent, you should vote for Scott Starin for the 2nd Congressional District. He is the right man at the right time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Look beyond</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> corporate blame</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I t is understandable that disillusioned voters increasingly seek to blame big business for hijacking the Republican Party. But to stop there in our quest for reform, we risk missing the perspective necessary to rescue our political system, not to mention the Republican Party in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We must learn the lessons from the marketing strategy that has pervaded that party at all levels. When Nixon employed the &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; to entice southern Democrats to change parties it was the beginning of an end-justifies-the-means morality that has since taken over the party. The emphasis has increasingly been on strategy rather than substance. Ginrich took this to a new level, and Rove far beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is now about power and maintaining power. Morality and values have become nothing more than words; words used outside the context of ethics to achieve whatever the marketing objective is. The Republican strategists have been selling a &quot;brand.&quot; They approach politics as if they were selling Nike or Disney. When they sell the Republican brand effectively they don't have to get into discussing &quot;product&quot; features. Note: In the case of politics, the actual products are the policies and programs having to do with health care, the economy, foreign relations, etc. Along the way the Republicans have also prospered from the strategy of discrediting the competing brand (Democrats) with negative labeling. Once on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> defensive, the Democrats have found it difficult to get the public to focus on policy differences and on real issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now that the economy has tanked, however, the strategy of brand-selling is not working so well. And, with voters weary of the war, it is as if nominee McCain can't find a product to sell. Hence, Obama's strategy of focusing on Democratic values and voter needs, and away from personal attacks, is working. Now that Obama has our attention, it looks as if he will have our votes. But once elected it is vital that he provide us with policies that work and which meet our needs. If he is successful it can serve as a model for traditional Republicans to take back their Party and for America to return to a two-party system free from the current divisiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is an important opportunity -- we can't afford to squander it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T his letter is in response to Jinny Jordan's column &quot;Pro-lifers: Choose action over rhetoric&quot; published by the Enterprise on Oct. 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frankly it is Jinny Jordan that &quot;has gotten it all wrong.&quot; She chastises &quot;the pro-life movement&quot; for being judgmental of women who have had abortions or are in crisis pregnancies, all the while being judgmental herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jinny must not know many pro-lifers. Let me point out that the pro-life movement's fundamental tenet is this: &quot;We can love them both&quot; (meaning mother and child). The fact is that the pro-life movement has been running pregnancy help programs, such as the Gabriel Project, and post-abortion healing and counseling services, such as Rachel's Vineyard, for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These and many similar programs offer everything from free diapers to a listening ear for women who are faced with a crisis pregnancy or suffering form the emotional pain of an abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have been involved in pro-life activities for many, many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> years and I have never heard anyone criticizing women in crisis pregnancies the way Jinny claims we do. She is right about one thing, though. With more than 4,000 abortions being performed each day in the United States, not only have we lost out on so many unique lives that were perhaps meant to touch ours, but we are a looking at an epidemic of post abortion- suffering, which the abortion industry continues to ignore. To know if you are suffering from Post- Abortion Syndrome just Google the words post, abortion, healing. Help is just one click away -- thanks to the pro-life movement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama policies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> patent Marxism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> R obin Hood's gambit: Rob the rich, pay the poor. Sen. Obama told an Ohio man on Oct. 13, the self-employed plumber will pay higher taxes because he plans to &quot;spread the wealth around.&quot; Except the senator doesn't call it income redistribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Euphemisms like &quot;change&quot; or &quot;fairness&quot; play better. So it's only fair the rich pay for the poor. It'll be &quot;good for everybody.&quot; Really?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, I am not calling Sen. Obama a Marxist. A CPA with long experience, I disclaim any intention here of an ad hominem attack. His policies are patent Marxism, and a fair target. Unfortunately, some readers will misunderstand. To those who don't, please listen up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marxism defined: &quot;From each according to their means, to each, according to their need,&quot; Karl Marx. The Federal Tax Code structures progressive tax rates; as bracket income increases, the rate of tax increases. The lowest individual rate is 15 percent; the highest, 35 percent. In 2006, the latest federal data available, tax filers with above $50,000 in taxable income paid 90.3 percent of all personal income taxes; 56.9 percent, (below $50,000), paid 9.7 percent, 3.8 percent, (above $200,0000), paid 50.6 percent. One-third of tax filers paid no tax. Without question, our already socialist tax structure causes high earners to pay a disproportionate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> share of taxes. Sen. Obama asserts this is not fair because it is not enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His published tax plan promises to lower income taxes on 95 percent of taxpayers through refundable targeted credits. So though one-third pay no tax, they'll get a refund. He will raise capital gains taxes by one-third, taxes on ordinary income above $250,000 by one-twelfth and corporate taxes by half. CCH analysis estimates the cost of his tax policies at $160 billion per year, net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perilously, this plan assumes falsely that GDP will not drop below its current level. U.S. history has demonstrated that raising tax rates on business and capital inhibits GDP and job growth. Small tax increases aside, Sen. Obama's extreme hikes will contract GDP, because the confiscatory tax rates on business will force millions of layoffs and thousands of small businesses into bankruptcy, massively increasing unemployment and welfare. Where is real concern for the poor in such a plan? Despite new tax revenues, the deficit will be severely exacerbated. Do not be deceived. Either Sen. Obama misunderstands taxation, or he's counting on your misunderstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sen. Obama's change to definitive socialism will exact an unacceptable human cost by crushing middle and lower income Americans, reduced to dependency on the state. Of course, the classless state is the Marxist means to pipe-dream utopia. America has demonstrated just the opposite --working people rising through expanding economic opportunities. The American Dream's realized promise floats all boats. Marxism drains the pond and calls it fairness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, the fundamental question in considering Sen. Obama for president is: Are you ready for America to take the Marxist path? Maybe. But when you vote, and I hope you will, make an informed choice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the federal government takes a dramatic step toward taking ownership in U.S. banks, financial experts say lawmakers are avoiding the grittiest questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Congress demand greater accountability of financial firms' leaders? And does a 1999 deregulation law that heaped more responsibility on banks to police their own risks provide key lessons?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush administration and Congress passed caps on senior executives' pay as part of the recent bailout package, but a September Securities and Exchange Commission audit has inspired some experts to call for wider corporate-governance controls, such as requiring banks' directors to assess risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The single biggest overlooked issue in the current crisis is the failure of corporate governance,&quot; said J. Robert Brown, professor of securities law at the University of Denver, who believes that Congress and states should hold members of bank boards, as well as top officers, to higher regulatory standards. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some current and former lawmakers told The Denver Post that they, too, believe the government should look at expanding corporate accountability to help prevent the economy from later sliding into a sinkhole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bipartisan 1999 Financial Services Modernization Act has received its share of criticism for enabling the current conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The act, aggressively lobbied for by the finance industry, removed banking restrictions that limited speculation and prevented merging commercial and investment firms and insurance operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It helped spawn broader and riskier investments without strict federal oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some lawmakers and economists refuse to place blame squarely on FSMA, also known as the Gramm-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leach-Bliley Act because its lead author was Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. They say the law, opposed only by Rep. Joel Hefley among Colorado's delegation at the time (Rep. Scott McInnis missed the vote), has prevented banks from totally collapsing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, even though financial-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">services giant Bear Stearns became larded up with bad mortgage investments, FSMA paved the way for JP Morgan to acquire it earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good adjustments&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That bill is actually an example of how we made good adjustments to the industry,&quot; said Steve Wymer, spokesman for Republican Sen. Wayne Allard, who voted for FSMA, as did both Coloradans trying to succeed him in the Senate, Democratic Rep. Mark Udall and former Republican Rep. Bob Schaffer. &quot;It has allowed firms to consolidate and not go under.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, other financial experts and market regulators say the law is the tipping point in a wider decades-long deregulation push that led to dangerous pursuits, such as high concentrations of mortgage-backed securities investments that crippled Bear Stearns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The failure of (FSMA) to give regulatory authority over investment bank holding companies to any agency of government was, based on the experience of the last several months, a costly mistake,&quot; testified SEC Chairman Christopher Cox in a hearing on Capitol Hill last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cox and the Bush administration also have been assailed for decisions relaxing capital rules on investment firms, enabling them to pile up debt and risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But deregulation's roots run deep and are partly shaped by campaign-finance largess. In the early 1980s, Congress removed rules overseeing the savings-and-loan industry. Then through the 1990s and earlier this decade, lawmakers and federal agencies eased restrictions on creditors and securities firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both FSMA, which gutted the Glass-Steagal Act limiting bank speculation, and the 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization Act, deregulating derivatives, followed a major lobbying effort by the finance industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry pumped at least $86 million in campaign contributions to lawmakers between 1997 and November 1999, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. FSMA, arguably the most far-reaching deregulatory measure, passed Congress with wide bipartisan support, 452-65.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawmakers who favored FSMA accepted twice as much industry money at the time as those who opposed it, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voluntary program</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those experts who see wisdom in adding new corporate-governance rules point to a September SEC internal audit. Some large investment banks such as Bear Stearns came under some SEC scrutiny through a voluntary program called CSE. The SEC's inspector general, however, said in the audit that many of the program's guidelines had little teeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, SEC examiners knew of excessive concentrations in the firm's portfolio of mortgage-backed securities - products now targeted for purchase in the federal government's $700 billion bailout plan - without taking action, including alerting board members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although (the team of examiners) was aware, prior to Bear Stearns becoming a CSE firm, that Bear Stearns' concentration of mortgage securities was increasing for several years and was beyond its internal limits. ... (The team) did not make any efforts to limit&quot; the company's exposure, according to the internal review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And examiners &quot;took no actions to assess Board of Directors' and senior officials' tolerance for risk,&quot; the sentence reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of what happened to Bear Stearns and others, some congressional representatives sought corporate-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">governance requirements as a condition of the bailout, including caps on executive compensation and a say for shareholders in pay decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a provision curbing executive compensation and banning golden parachutes has been preserved thus far. That clause also has been criticized for loopholes that will still allow company bosses to rake in large sums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown, the University of Denver expert, said the September SEC report raises important questions about how engaged the Bear Stearns board directors were and why Congress doesn't demand more accountability for such directors industrywide, in addition to more oversight powers for federal agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">States such as Delaware, where more than half of the Fortune 500 companies are incorporated, have failed to hold corporate board members accountable for risk, Brown said, requiring only &quot;a process for receiving information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress could pick up where it left off with Sarbanes-Oxley, passed in the wake of Enron and other corporate debacles, that largely mandated enhanced accounting oversight, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Brown, &quot;In this bill, Congress could have said something along the lines of 'It's the responsibility of the board of directors to assess risk and specifically require that they obtain information about risk.' Right now they don't have that obligation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Paisley, vice president of the Washington-based Center for American Progress think tank, said some congressional leaders' promises to add protections to the current bailout measure, in addition to ongoing economic troubles, mean &quot;everything including corporate-governance controls will be wide open for consideration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such controls weren't even debated at the time of FSMA's passage in 1999, given the confidence in the market to put a check on itself, said Paisley, who monitored that process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What they should have done and did not do was set in place regulatory structures for a brand new world of finance,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other economists are less optimistic that more regulatory efforts to strengthen corporate governance will work. Jonathan Macey of Cornell University refuses to blame FSMA: &quot;This crisis is not a matter of abusing regulations. This is greed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top campaign contributor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New reform efforts could hit stiff resistance from the financial sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If its track record of campaign contributions is any indication, the industry still commands steady influence. And for donations since 1989, the sector - covering finance, insurance and real estate businesses - ranks as the top industry contributor in federal elections, steering more than $2 billion to candidates and political parties, Center for Responsive Politics research shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Udall said through a spokeswoman that he doesn't regret voting for FSMA, because it was important to help banks maintain a competitive position in the &quot;global&quot; marketplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That doesn't mean the regulators did enough to enforce the other rules or that we shouldn't take another look at stricter regulation,&quot; said Heather Fox, a Udall spokeswoman. &quot;And I expect the next Congress to do so&quot; regardless of lobbying pressures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Rep. Schaffer, now running against Udall for Allard's seat, sees FSMA as only &quot;marginally related to the meltdown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But given the size of the bailout, he favors legislative efforts to explore corporate-governance standards. &quot;I would like to see further efforts with respect to transparency from an investor's standpoint.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R eading between the lines and through the thick brush, attempting to connect a few dots from the more interesting stories that dotted the sports media landscape this week:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without the possibility of a Dodgers-Red Sox World Series matchup -- Hollywood can only do so much to make everything a reality -- the L.A.-based Fox Sports executive think tank will say they're fine and dandy with the Phillies playing anyone for the title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if it's the non-devilish Rays of Tampa Bay? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You'll always find matchups on paper are going to look more attractive,&quot; Fox Sports boss Ed Goren said of a non-Dodger, non-Red Sox World Series next week. &quot;We're going to play the hand we're given.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While baseball analysts like ESPN's Tim Kurkjian (talking on a recent &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot;) echoed what many fear, that Fox has a &quot;ratings disaster&quot; on its hands, Sports Illustrated's Tom Verducci, who did dugout reports on the ALCS during TBS' coverage, has another more pertinent angle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Adding to the low-profile problem (of Phillies-Rays) is the playoff schedule with the extra days off,&quot; he said. &quot;We might be looking at as many as five straight days with no baseball by the time we get to World Series Game 1 (on Wednesday). By then, with any momentum killed, people will be out of the habit of tuning into baseball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wednesday's presidential debate didn't help Fox's Game 5 NLCS coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fox has persuaded MLB to push back the start of the World Series' potential Game 6 on Wednesday, Oct. 29, so it can run (along with CBS and NBC) a half-hour Barack Obama political commercial at 6 p.m..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fans in the stadium waiting at the game now guaranteed to be on the East Coast should embrace that kind of delay (first pitch is now 8:35 p.m., rather than 8:22 p.m.), so the benefit is no pregame, while Fox makes about $1 million in the deal for selling the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the first reactions: &quot;It's unfortunate the World Series' first pitch is being delayed for Obama's political pitch. Not only is Obama putting politics before principle, he's putting it before our national pastime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That came from Republican National Committee spokesperson Alex Conant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He must have conveniently forgotten that NBC moved the kickoff of the Sept. 4 Thursday night 2008 season opener between the Redskins and Giants up a full hour so it would finish before John McCain's Republican Convention acceptance speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Magic Johnson, ending a seven-season run as one of the lucky charms in the popular TNT NBA studio cereal bowl, said this week that the reason he'll be joining the ABC studio show starting on Christmas Day is the opportunity to cover the league finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These days, ABC and ESPN are interchangeable, all under the Disney multi-synergistic umbrella.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Which, if you think about it, why wouldn't the Magic Kingdom want a little more Magic in its kingdom?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Madden isn't making the cross-country cruise in his custom-made bus from the homestead in Northern</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> California to Tampa, Fla., for Sunday's NBC NFL game between the Seahawks and Buccaneers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is he burned out? Could this be the first step toward him stepping aside? Who in NBC ever-expanding studio lineup could possibly be his successor?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Sunday, it'll be Cris Collinsworth sitting in with Al Michaels (who, with wife Linda, got some primetime face time sitting in the primo Dodger Stadium seats next to the Dodgers' on-deck circle for the NLCS Game 5, after Pat Sajak and Penny Marshall vacated).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NBC also takes the next Sunday off, deferring to Game 3 of the World Series on Fox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In essence, the 72-year-old Madden has a personal bye week, followed by a network bye. But don't say bye-bye so fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Last spring when I got the (NFL) schedule I began to look ahead, and with this being a Super Bowl year, I wanted to try to get John a break,&quot; said NBC Sports chief Dick Ebersol. &quot;I am simply looking to rest my best player, and I think this is part of being a smart manager and nothing more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Madden, who blames the lack of success by the local San Francisco 49ers and Oakland Raiders for not giving him a &quot;home&quot; game broadcast once and awhile: &quot;I enjoy the travel, but I have five grandkids and don't get home sometimes for five or six months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you want to read more into it, sure, NBC has to think ahead. So does Madden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Again, if you're looking for clues on who'll replace whom, consider that Madden asked Collinsworth to be the voice of the &quot;Madden '09&quot; video game instead of doing it himself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Letters To The Editor</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pg. B-14</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vote no on narcissism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Narcissism, a personality disorder, is unfortunately in abundance throughout American politics. Does your politician have inflated self-esteem or grandiosity, a preoccupation with success and power, believe he/she is special and unique, require excessive admiration, have a sense of entitlement, take advantage of others to achieve his or her agenda, lack empathy, believe that others are envious of him/her, show arrogance, haughty behaviors or attitudes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If so, your politician is a narcissist who is more interested in their personal needs than their constituents'. This behavior contributes to gridlock and an ineffective Congress and violates rules of common decency that regular citizens utilize in their daily lives to be productive at work, at home, and with friends. If we carried ourselves as some of our politicians do on Capitol Hill, our lives would reflect the train wreck that is American politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can do something about it - at the next election - vote them out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chip Melick, Denver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amendment 52 will benefit roads and bridges As someone who is tired of watching politicians dither while our roads and bridges fall into disrepair, I'm voting for Amendment 52. It is a smart plan that reinvests extra severance tax dollars in better roads and safer bridges - with no tax increase for Colorado taxpayers. Yes, Amendment 52 puts road funding in the state constitution, but a portion of existing road funding (the Highway Users Trust Fund) is already in the constitution. Of course, there is a reason the drafters of Amendment 52 put the money in the constitution. Each and every year the state legislature raids hundreds of millions of dollars from transportation funding. Enough is enough. It is time to fix our roads and bridges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I agree with all the business leaders who have endorsed Amendment 52. Our transportation system is our single biggest asset in the state and belongs to all of us. We must make sure it is maintained and safe. It is time to get to work on Colorado's ailing infrastructure. Join me and vote &quot;yes&quot; on Amendment 52.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terri Binder, Grand Junction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama falsehoods shouldn't create fear Re: &quot;Scared about Obama,&quot; Oct. 13 letter to the editor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who are &quot;scared&quot; of Barack Obama need to get over it. To try, sneakily, to imply that 9/11 had anything to do with him or anyone he &quot;pals around with&quot; is just ignorant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is an American, a Christian, a respected politician, a person who has achieved greatly in his life, a family man, a man with high morals and principles, a man who wants to take this country back to the decency and respect it has always enjoyed until the last disastrous president destroyed all of that. He is extremely intelligent, hard-working, and admirable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is not a terrorist, an Arab, or anything else that clueless or vicious people would like to paint him as.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sally Alberts, Monument</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This letter demonstrates how negative ads impact the opinion of people. If the writer had read the article in The Denver Post (page 23A) on Oct 12. titled &quot;Web ad from McCain is dark, sinister, and a big pack of lies,&quot; she would have learned that the Chicago Annenberg Challenge is an educational foundation created by a mainstream Republican. William Ayers, now a college professor, &quot;was active in getting the foundation started but was never on the board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has expressed his disapproval of Ayers' past actions and violent history. I doubt that anyone would want to be held responsible for the actions of people we've known through our lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what the writer sees as Obama's elitism, I see as intelligence, a trait that this country desperately needs in the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apples and oranges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I received this e-mail from my daughter regarding my 13-year-old grandson's take on last week's presidential debate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He watched some of the debate last night. This morning he told me that, to him, it was like they were asked if they like apples or oranges better and they replied that they like cheese on their burgers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How could it possibly be described any better?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnie Morris, Littleton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the public really need &quot;public opinion&quot;? Re: &quot;Arapahoe political tide turns,&quot; Oct. 9 news story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news media too often subject us to the results of one poll or another. Apparently they believe that we readers and viewers cannot formulate decisions; rather, we must be instructed about &quot;public opinion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But consider how illogical that assumption is. If we need &quot;public opinion&quot; to guide our thought and yet we are fools, who is that &quot;public&quot; whose opinion should make decisions for us?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Oct. 9 article revealed that Floyd Ciruli, founder of the oft-quoted poll-takers Ciruli Associates, is former chairman of the Colorado Democratic Party. Now there's an objective poll-taker!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are all aware that a question's form profoundly affects the likely answer. For example, &quot;Do you think schools should be adequately funded?&quot; is a far different question than &quot;Do you support raising taxes to increase school administrators' salaries?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News reports of public-opinion polls derive from the insulting premise that we cannot decide issues for ourselves. Topping that fundamental insult with the choice of a politically motivated pollster reflects poor judgment or a crude effort to mold our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We deserve greater respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peg Brady, Centennial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better way to pick VP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Am I the only one in the United States who is upset about the way the vice president is picked? The presidential candidates, who won their nomination by primaries, get to pick anyone to run for vice president. Several times in my life, a vice president has been called on to serve. I feel that the vice presidential candidate should also be by the will of the people. The runner-up in the primary vote should be vice president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vice president doesn't have to be a buddy to the president. But he or she should be by the will of the people, not the will of the presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PERSPECTIVE; Pg. D-04</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">583 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't always sip scotch whisky at the Salida Single Malt Sampling Society. We also taste rye, tequila, Irish, bourbon - and last week, the only known legal Colorado whiskey, 92-proof Stranahan's. Our verdict was that it was pretty rough on the first sip, but seemed to improve as one moved down the glass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We could not be sure, however, whether that was the nature of the potation or a variant of how &quot;the girls always look prettier at closing time.&quot; Our closing time was early so we could go home and watch the presidential debate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not sure why we bothered. For one thing, I don't know why we call these events &quot;debates.&quot; I took the course in high school. There was a formal proposition, and we took the affirmative or negative. We had to address the proposition, rather than mean-mouth the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best part about the class was that often, you didn't know which side you'd be on until class started, so you had to learn both sides and be prepared to argue either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A real debate between candidates would have a proposition like &quot;Resolved: The United States should adopt a universal single-payer health-care system&quot; or &quot;Resolved: Alaska should be an independent nation.&quot; The candidates would make their arguments and rebuttals, and we would judge accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alleged model for the modern presentations is the series of debates between Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln for an Illinois U.S. Senate seat in 1858. The candidates alternated as to who would speak first. The first speaker got an hour, the second an hour and a half, and the first speaker came back for 30 minutes of rebuttal, for a total of three hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we have now is more like a public job interview, with applicants fielding and evading questions. Why do we call it a debate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And where do the networks find those &quot;undecided&quot; voters to query? Both candidates have been running hard for more than a year. Anyone with the slightest interest in public affairs has all the information necessary to make a decision, and there can't be that many Americans who just emerged from comas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But wait. Might some candidate make a game-changing gaffe? I'll wager that Barack Obama lost not a single vote when he said &quot;green behind the ears&quot; instead of &quot;wet behind the ears,&quot; and John McCain's &quot;that one&quot; did not change anyone's mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It turned out to be an evening better devoted for sampling whiskey, but perhaps the final &quot;debate&quot; this week will be an improvement. The odds are against it, though. Whiskey gets better with age, but campaigns apparently do not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In last Sunday's column, I wrote that John Marshall, manager of two losing Republican campaigns, became development director at Mesa State College from a patronage appointment, and the job was not advertised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One source was an article in the Grand Junction Free Press, which quoted Mesa President Tim Foster saying the college chose not to advertise the position because it wanted to act quickly to continue raising money to remodel the fieldhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This inspired a call from Foster, followed by an e-mail. He said the college does not have patronage jobs and normal hiring procedures were followed; the position was advertised on the college's website and in local media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I also appreciate the retraction - if it comes - will, in all likelihood, be marginalized,&quot; Foster wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, I've done my best to hide it here.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SALIDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On a patio overlooking the sparkling Arkansas River, Sen. Ken Salazar, wearing his custom white ten-gallon hat and bolo tie, stood on a chair and began his pitch to a hundred or so people gathered at a Mexican restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama wants everyone in this state to understand that ... no matter how far you are off the beaten path ... you count,&quot; Salazar said. &quot;We are here to celebrate Chaffee County and to let you know how important you are to Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The half-hour stop ended with campaign staffers jokingly telling the chips-and-salsa-eating crowd that they held the rally in a room with one exit so they could snag volunteers when people left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night before, a half-dozen &quot;Hispanics for McCain&quot; canvassed a Pueblo neighborhood after work. Harold Trujillo chatted about Arizona's Sen. John McCain and running mate Sarah Palin on front porches in the traditional Democratic stronghold. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to die a Democrat, but he (McCain) was there for me,&quot; said Trujillo, a 66-year-old retired steelworker. &quot;He was out fighting for my freedom, so he deserves my vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome to a raging battleground state 23 days out from a national election, where the push to find the roughly 8 percent of undecided voters here has grown into a fierce 24-hour-a-day foot race between the parties, which vow they need Colorado's nine electoral votes to win the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To understand the candidates' political field strategy in a swing state is to understand some of the most scientific approaches that exist in unearthing wavering voters and pulling them over the fence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigns are wary about giving specifics, but a week of shadowing door-knockers, phone banks and outreach efforts on both sides revealed bare-knuckled aggression to woo voters from Denver to Sterling to Pueblo to Montrose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Obama campaign strategists have created intelligence reports of sorts on voters, neighborhoods and cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using formulas parsing voter history, the kinds of magazines people read, cars they drive, credit cards they own and jobs they hold, they have mapped tossup precincts, tossup homes and tossup voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They look at neighborhoods, cities and counties that have seen demographic shifts. A Democrat or a Republican who has always been a loyal party voter may get a call from the other side based on where they just moved or a newspaper they just started subscribing to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the final three weeks, we only have the capacity to talk to so many voters,&quot; said Anne Filipic, Obama's general election director for Colorado. &quot;The last thing you want to do is limit your campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers are sent to walk blocks with campaign literature and clipboards, trying to find undecided voters and &quot;base&quot; people who may not be particularly inclined to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This second group is important because they could be a shoo-in for a particular party - they just need to be goaded to the polls, said Ken Smukler, president of InfoVoter Technologies, a Philadelphia-based political consulting firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you polled the African-American community, it's probably 95 to 5 percent for Obama,&quot; he said. &quot;The problem isn't convincing an African-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American voter how to vote; the problem is convincing a voter who hasn't voted before to get out to the poll.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these targeted areas, people are so weary of campaign volunteers at their doorsteps, residents often no longer answer their doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stuck on the porch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a walk through a southwest Denver neighborhood last week, Obama volunteer 26-year-old Raj Grewal was having little luck - even at homes with cars in the driveway. Most front porches were cluttered with ballot initiative and U.S. Senate race fliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New York corporate lawyer who took a sabbatical to volunteer for Obama in Colorado, he received only one response: A women yelled from the door that she was too busy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When campaigns locate undecided voters, they usually try to find a volunteer who looks like them to make the pitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Tom Kise said an undecided registered Democrat may get an automated call from someone like Joe Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat turned independent who is supporting McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they're in Pueblo and they're Hispanic, maybe (local Latino activist) Silver Salazar calls them,&quot; Kise said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 9 percent to 10 percent of undecided voters nationwide are likely just starting to pay attention to the campaigns, political experts say. They may turn on a debate or turn off a negative commercial. They aren't tuning in to day-to-day stump speeches or gotcha snarks employed by both parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's not much pie left to split,&quot; said former U.S. Rep. Scott McInnis, now a Denver lawyer advising the McCain campaign. &quot;You're running out of time to change the direction of the ship. ... Are we better to be at soccer games, or are we better to focus on a CU football game? It comes to down to decisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as the campaign season draws down, those pounding the pavement often become that lever that turns the election results that crucial 1 or 2 percentage points to victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personal appeals crucial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the battleground states, it's critical,&quot; Smukler said. &quot;In a race that is cutting by a half a percentage point, it's not the TV ads, it's the ground operations, it's the grassroots organizations. ... That's where it matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enter former Gov. Roy Romer, plunking himself down in a booth at a Pueblo greasy spoon, bending the ear of an undecided voter eating breakfast. Or Sam Sanchez in Pueblo, who walked a neighborhood last week for McCain after his shift ended at the Target distribution center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silver Salazar spends most days in his &quot;Democrats for McCain&quot; T-shirt in the basement headquarters of the Republican hopeful's field office in Pueblo. A cousin to Sen. Salazar and a prominent Pueblo political activist, he is helping reach out to Latino voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the undecided, mostly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">middle-class Latino voters need to hear how McCain relates to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's sort of like, who can help me the most?&quot; Salazar said, noting his wife is undecided. &quot;It's about forming coalitions, Hispanics for McCain, Veterans for McCain, Women for McCain. ... It's talking to people about who is the best person to represent them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a McCain phone bank in Centennial recently, more than 25 people filled the room after work - toting children, pets and pizza - to make calls to targeted voters. When volunteers reached someone voting for McCain, they would ring a bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously if it were a slam dunk in Colorado, you wouldn't feel half as inclined to spend your time in here rather than a golf course,&quot; said Lowell Arnold, a 77-year-old retired insurance consultant, working the phones. &quot;Every vote counts in Colorado.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newcomer factor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state isn't accustomed to being so hotly contested. It voted for a Democrat in the presidential election only once in the past 40 years: In 1992, Colorado went for Bill Clinton, but Ross Perot took 23 percent of the vote that year, cutting a large swath into incumbent President George Bush's base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most polls, including one completed by The Denver Post at the beginning of October, put Obama and McCain in a statistical tie here. Both campaigns say they are expanding their volunteer armies as Election Day nears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State observers say Colorado's entrenched political right-leaning loyalties are working against a large number of educated newcomers to the mostly urban Front Range who are proud to be unpredictable and independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Salazar said these people are &quot;tired of ideology and division. ... They care about jobs, health care and energy overdependence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rural roots strong</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not forgotten in either campaign are the state's rural roots, and the voters in outlying areas who are usually more fiscally and socially conservative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ken Salazar's swing through these areas last week on behalf of Obama, he affirmed that the Illinois senator wouldn't take away their guns and that he believed in protecting wildlands for hunters and fishers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Valerie Harris and Guy Hummel, who live outside Pueblo, sat at a diner while Romer and the Salazar brothers, Sen. Salazar and U.S. Rep. John Salazar, gladhanded people eating huevos rancheros and biscuits and gravy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brother and sister pair run a small cattle ranch and are struggling with the recent financial crisis because they can't get a short-term loan from the local Pueblo bank to buy more cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We care about water, health care and the economy,&quot; said Harris, watching Obama staffers set up a podium near their booth. She and her brother are undecided. &quot;It's hard for us here. ... We need someone to understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This election has never been about John McCain - though his candidacy is sure to revive a debate about the worst presidential candidates of all time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, this is a referendum on Barack Obama. And many Republicans are exuding the confidence of a hopelessly quixotic sports fan - a person who watches his atrocious team struggle for three quarters with the false expectation that some miraculous comeback is imminent in the fourth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It rarely is. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has consistently remained inconsistent, vacillating between promises and populism. From his support of cap-and-trade to his actions during the bailout, McCain's positions seem entirely focused on winning the middle-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of-the-road vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No modern Republican has ever won the presidency solely focused on the ambivalent squishy inattentive center. These people don't care enough to name their political party, much less pay attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he's a maverick. One of McCain's central arguments has been his uncompromising valor in opposing the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a newsbreak: Disagreeing with the Bush administration on a handful of issues (often the wrong ones, in McCain's case) doesn't make you a maverick, it makes you an average American. And, sadly, the second debate proved that McCain would be incapable of making his party's philosophical or political case even if he genuinely tried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama claims, as he did during the second debate, that raising taxes on the rich is the equivalent of giving them a &quot;break,&quot; McCain, terrified of defending anyone in a Lexus, failed to make an assertive case that economic freedom helps everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama claimed he would lower income taxes for 95 percent of Americans even though nearly 40 percent of households don't pay a single cent in income taxes, McCain just smiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama continued his absurd insistence that our financial mess was caused only by Bush-era &quot;deregulation,&quot; McCain struggled to place the blame where it belongs: on government meddling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when Obama contended his economic plan would be a &quot;net&quot; cut in spending, McCain should have spit the water out of his mouth like a character on a TV sitcom - because that's exactly what the senior senator from Arizona is starring in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those Republicans anticipating a fourth-quarter comeback during the debate were instead hit with a wet fish. Did the putative Republican candidate just propose that the U.S. Treasury renegotiate millions of mortgages at a better price?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was McCain simply unable to articulate a more complex position? It sounded a lot like a comprehensive nationalization of the mortgage industry. It sounded a lot like hundreds of billions of additional tax dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yep, he meant it. It's called the American Homeownership Resurgence. It will stabilize the economy. And Obama will stop global warming. And McCain will find bin Laden, even if he has to do it with his bare hands. And ... well, at this pace, we're about two debates away from being promised free lemonade and snicker doodles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of these promises have worked. So now the McCain campaign will set its sights on Bill Ayers, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Tony Rezko and other members of the Legion of Doom. All of them are legitimate topics for conversation, but with less than a month to go, the conversation reeks of desperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the entire campaign has been one big act of publicity stunts. McCain's shining moment this campaign, as far as I can tell, was a funny ad comparing Obama to Paris Hilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What McCain's candidacy does tell us is that the Republican Party - even if it somehow miraculously pulls this one out - is in need of some creative destruction. Not ideological purity but ideological renewal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because being a &quot;maverick&quot; is a political slogan, not a political philosophy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NASHVILLE, TENN. - John McCain and Barack Obama drew sharp contrasts on taxes, the economy and foreign policy Tuesday as the two battled to capture both the mantle of reformer and the votes of undecided Americans in a town-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hall-style debate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the shadow of another disastrous day on Wall Street and an increasingly nasty race, the two presidential candidates clashed on nearly every question asked by moderator Tom Brokaw and a handful of undecided voters at Belmont University. Yet, most of their comments were cautious and well-scripted lines from the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There wasn't much new from the past debate, but they did present voters with clear contrasts,&quot; said Diana B. Carlin, a professor of communication studies at the University of Kansas who has surveyed political debates for more than 20 years. &quot;They had very different philosophies, and as an undecided voter, if you were looking for something particular, you probably found it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the trash-talking that led up to the second presidential debate, the candidates generally steered clear of character attacks and instead slapped each other's records. Although both tried to reach out to the audience, the debate was devoid of any remarkable events like the &quot;I feel your pain&quot; moment by Bill Clinton in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican McCain, fighting to gain momentum in the wake of national polls that show him trailing Democrat Obama, proposed to help homeowners with a $300 billion federal cash infusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would order the secretary of the Treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes, at the diminished value of those homes, and let people make those, be able to make those payments and stay in their homes. Is it expensive? Yes,&quot; he said. (His campaign said the money would be part of the $700 billion &quot;rescue&quot; plan.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who often focused on the middle class, stressed his tax-cut plan for those making under $250,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes,&quot; he said. &quot;It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs. And then long term we've got to fix our health care system, and we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 90-minute debate came 28 days before Election Day. About 80 people, picked by the independent Gallup Organization, attended the event. About one-third was undecided, another third leaned toward McCain and the final third was shifting toward Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates agreed on a gloomy forecast for Wall Street and Main Street but were optimistic that the right leader could help pull the economy up by its bootstraps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain blamed the mortgage crisis on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as Obama's &quot;cronies and friends&quot; there. Obama said the economic meltdown was the &quot;final verdict&quot; on the Bush administration's failed economic policies, as well as McCain's backing of deregulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain painted Obama as inexperienced and naive on foreign policy and a hide-the-ball, tax-and-spend liberal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nailing down Sen. Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama characterized McCain as erratic and a continuation of the Bush administration. He also criticized McCain for possessing the &quot;wrong judgment&quot; on foreign-policy issues, such as the war in Iraq, and stretching the truth not only about Obama's record but his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the 'Straight Talk Express' lost a wheel on that one,&quot; Obama said, referring to the way McCain construed Obama's tax plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See-sawing between sitting on stools and walking around the horseshoe-shaped stage, McCain and Obama were generally polite, but at times could not hide their annoyance with one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after being introduced, McCain said to Obama: &quot;It's good to be with you at a town-hall meeting,&quot; a swipe at Obama for rejecting the Arizona's senator's request to hold joint town halls during the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later referred to Obama as &quot;that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the two sparred on foreign policy, McCain said he believes in Theodore Roosevelt's mantra of &quot;speak softly and carry a big stick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama retorted: &quot;This is a guy who sang bomb, bomb, bomb Iran, who called for the annihilation of North Korea - that I don't think is an example of speaking softly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going into the second to last debate, the candidates had different objectives and challenges. Obama, usually more comfortable in large venues, needed to exhibit a more emotional, personal touch with the goal of solidifying his national lead. McCain, who excels in small town-hall events, wanted to reverse the damage he has sustained over the past few weeks, while not coming across as angry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carlin, the Kansas professor, said she thought both candidates did what they had to do, though ``they can't really do anything radically different at this stage.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If John McCain or Barack Obama wants to win the vote of 58-year-old small-business owner Gary Suposs, he should take note of the typical composite of an undecided voter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suposs, with his two jobs, hasn't had a lot of time to pay attention to the daily back-and-forth snarks coming from either side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an equipment company business owner and farmer in Paonia, he worries about the economy. He is dubious about the $700 billion financial bailout but doesn't completely understand it. He wants to know how the United States is going to get out of Iraq, and he wants to hear what both candidates are going to do for him and his small business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is waiting for the next two debates, which he's going to put his life aside for, to make his decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rest of this stuff,&quot; he said, railing against the negative commercials, &quot;sometimes I want to throw a brick through the television.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest Denver Post poll, unaffiliated voters in Colorado favor Obama, 49 percent to McCain's 31 percent. Yet another key 11 percent say they are still undecided in Colorado. The poll's margin of error among unaffiliated voters is plus or minus 5 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among all voters, however, the two candidates are deadlocked here. McCain offsets Obama's sizeable lead among unaffiliateds because he does much better among registered Republicans, according to the poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Usually undecided voters are too busy to pay attention until the month before the election, experts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These voters haven't tuned in fully,&quot; said Vanderbilt University political scientist John Geer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if they do, they resist a party label. They usually don't align themselves with hardcore values of any kind - Western, conservative or liberal - which means they are hard-pressed to be blown away by a standard stump speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's less regionalism than there used to be,&quot; said University of Colorado at Boulder professor Ken Bickers. &quot;Most of the people who vote in Colorado aren't ranchers, they aren't rural, they're not tied to water issues in a direct way. ... They are linked to the national and global economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statewide, the poll showed that the economy is by far the No. 1 issue. Worries about money and jobs overtook the war as the top concern last spring, but the economy is now almost the single issue, with 77 percent of Coloradans naming it. No other concern received more than 5 percent attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take 55-year-old Frances Kelly, who lives in a rural outskirt town near Lamar. She is worried about the economy, the war and the national debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though she doesn't have an affinity for all ideas Democratic, she's decided to vote for Obama for her grandchildren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what kind of a world we're leaving them,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bickers said McCain needs to try to find a way to connect with independents - particularly with the economic downturn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not McCain's election to lose,&quot; Bickers said. &quot;It's McCain's election to try and find a way to win.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AIG plans sale of business units to repay debt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The insurer American International Group Inc. said Friday it plans to sell off a number of business units to pay off its massive government loan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement was expected by Wall Street. But it now leaves investors wondering how much AIG will be able to raise from the sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the brink of failure last month, AIG was bailed out when the government offered it an $85 billion loan during the ongoing credit crisis that saw Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. file for bankruptcy protection and the sale of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to Bank of America Corp. In return for the loan, the government received warrants to purchase up to 79.9 percent of AIG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Autos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Toyota's zero-percent offer shows credit is available</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Toyota Motor Corp.'s unprecedented offer of zero-percent financing on nearly a dozen models is trying to make the point that tight credit is no excuse for buyers -- in fact, it's literally giving credit away for free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But after the top Japanese automaker posted a 32 percent drop in September sales that only domestic competitors had experienced until now, the question is: Is it enough to get people to buy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Toyota's U.S. division said Thursday night it will offer the free financing on 11 models with terms ranging from 36 to 60 months. The incentive expires Nov. 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Employment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economy sheds most jobs since 2003, more cuts seen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jobs are vanishing at the fastest pace in more than five years with pink slips likely to keep stacking higher in the months ahead, an urgent signal the country may be careening toward a deep and painful recession just as Americans prepare to elect a new president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether that's Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain, one of them will be dealing with the weakest employment climate in years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Increasingly skittish employers dropped the ax even harder in September, chopping payrolls by 159,000 -- more than double the cuts made just one month before. It was the ninth straight month of job losses. A staggering 760,000 jobs have disappeared so far this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seminars</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Camera hosting Web sessions for local businesses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Camera is hosting a three-session seminar this month led by Web consultant Libby Niemi to help local businesses learn how to maximize their Web presence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As two women who have done extensive public speaking, we know that telling one's life story is important for initial credibility. And, certainly, all the contenders for president and vice president have compelling stories. Yet we need to look beyond these stories and ask, &quot;What's your story line for America?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This election is not about their life stories from the past. Instead, it is about the life stories you and your children will live out in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before you vote on what story you want your family to live, here is a comparison of the candidates' positions on some issues of urgent concern to women:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxes: Despite the distortions from opponents' ads, the Obama/Biden team will lower taxes for the middle 95 percent of working families. The McCain/Palin team, on the other hand, will continue the Bush tax cuts to the top 1 percent of Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equal pay for equal work: Sen. Obama co-sponsored legislation to overturn a Supreme Court decision making it more difficult for women to challenge pay discrimination. Sen. McCain opposed the same legislation, calling it &quot;a great burden on business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child care and child protection: While in the Illinois Legislature, Sen. Obama helped to dramatically expand day care services and passed legislation to ensure young children are taught how to protect themselves against sexual predators. Sen. McCain has outrageously distorted the facts of this accomplishment in a new ad which tells voters that Sen. Obama &quot;wanted to teach 5-year-olds about sex,&quot; before they could read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence against women: Sen. Obama voted for funding to prevent domestic violence and abuse. Sen. McCain has voted against all such programs, including a grant to aid children who have witnessed family violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reproductive choice: Sen. Obama says it's never been more important to protect a woman's right to choose. While in the Illinois Legislature, he was the chief sponsor of a bill requiring that hospitals providing emergency services for sexual assault victims and also provide medically accurate information about emergency contraception. Sen. McCain brags about his zero percent rating on pro-choice issues. According to a Sept. 21 New York Times editorial, &quot;Mr. McCain, whose website proclaims his dedication to overturning Roe v. Wade, would appoint justices who could be expected to lead the charge to eliminate the right to abortion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has said that she would not support abortion even in cases of rape or incest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution gives women the right to vote. Thousands of early 20th century women fought for, marched for and went to jail for this right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your vote is also your choice. What life stories will you, your children and your grandchildren live?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Choose wisely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another big bank goes under</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citigroup agreed Monday to purchase Wachovia's banking operations for $2.1 billion in a deal arranged by federal regulators, making the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank the latest casualty of the widening global financial crisis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement comes after a fevered weekend courtship in which Citigroup and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. both were reportedly studying the books of Wachovia Corp., which was weighed down by losses linked to its ill-timed 2006 acquisition of mortgage lender Golden West Financial Corp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Columbus, Ohio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain attacks Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagging in the polls, Republican presidential candidate John McCain unleashed a blistering attack Monday on his Democratic rival, saying the race comes down to a simple question: &quot;Country first or Obama first?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his first public appearance since Friday night's debate, McCain said Democrat Barack Obama advocates tax-and-spend policies that &quot;will deepen our recession,&quot; and voted against funding for equipment needed by troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That is not putting the men and women of our military first,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prosecutor named in Justice probe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attorney General Michael Mukasey named a prosecutor Monday to investigate whether Bush administration officials violated federal law in the firings of nine federal prosecutors. The scandal stripped the Justice Department of its leadership, damaged its credibility and sparked a historic showdown in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision to push ahead on a criminal inquiry follows the recommendation of an internal Justice Department investigation that harshly criticized Bush administration officials, members of Congress and their aides for the ousters, which many considered politically motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rio de Janiero, Brazil</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brazilian officials say the Amazon is being deforested more than twice as fast as last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They blame higher global food prices for a sharp increase in illegal logging as soy farmers and cattle ranchers clear rain forest for crops and grazing land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Authorities say 292 square miles of Amazon was destroyed in August. That's a 228 percent increase over August of last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi, Kenya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. Navy shadows captured vessel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. helicopters on Monday buzzed a hijacked Ukrainian cargo ship carrying 33 Soviet-designed tanks and other weapons that officials fear could end up in the hands of al-Qaida-linked militants in Somalia if the pirates are allowed to escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thursday's seizure of the MV Faina off Somalia, a failed state seen as a key battleground in the war on terrorism, could bring dangerous effects across the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Aden, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Piracy has become a lucrative criminal racket in impoverished Somalia, bringing in millions of dollars in ransom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Canaveral, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hubble repair mission delayed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NASA said Monday it is delaying its mission to the Hubble Space Telescope until next year because of a serious breakdown of the observatory in orbit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Space shuttle Atlantis had been scheduled to blast off in just two weeks, but a new and unexpected problem with the Hubble appeared on Saturday night when the telescope stopped sending science data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That potentially means a new repair issue for the astronauts to confront -- one that they haven't trained for and never anticipated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mong the issues that Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and Republican standard-bearer John McCain should be addressing is the tragedy of delayed casualties from the U.S.-led intervention in Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Americans are familiar with the official Iraq toll -- as of last week, 4,169 U.S. dead, along with a several hundred from allied nations. Missing from that list, though, are Americans who fulfilled their duties and returned home unable to cope with the complexities of life after Iraq, often compounded by post-traumatic stress disorder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One such person died last week; his name was Dominic D.H. Pritchard, a resident of Oviedo, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was a U.S. Marine, a student, a citizen-soldier who volunteered with the Florida Army National Guard because of his desire to serve his community in times of calamity, and an emerging writer with a particular passion for history, military affairs and art.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he served bravely, if unexpectedly, for nearly two years in Iraq with Company C, 2nd Battalion, 124th Infantry Regiment. There, the trauma of the battlefield -- underscored by relentless shelling and the death of compatriots -- entered into his subconscious in ways that would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not immediately reveal themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Upon his return to civilian life, Pritchard -- an exceedingly bright man -- knew that something was amiss. He could not seem to assume his regular routine, to blend into the environment that once offered him comfort, security and satisfaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In frustration, he sought to end his life a few years ago; only the quick response of his attentive mother prevented a horrific result. But Pritchard was incapable of shedding his demons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One recent, dark, storm-swept night, just as he had finished a relaxed evening of pizza and conversation with his father and older brother, Pritchard crossed the main avenue leading to the family home and, within less than 30 minutes, took his own life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pritchard is hardly alone. Indeed, the ranks of the delayed casualties from Iraq -- the ones that will never make it into the official numbers -- continue to expand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reportedly, more than half of the suicides committed by those who came home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2001 to 2005 were linked to the National Guard or the reserves. According to a RAND Corp. study, about one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in five soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan shows signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, putting them at a higher risk for suicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These statistics should serve as a wake-up call for the nation. Whether or not one agrees with the original decision to intervene in Iraq is not the main concern here. Nor is the exact schedule of the U.S. withdrawal of combat forces or the timetable for other troops that will stay on. The fact of the matter is that under an administration headed by either Obama or McCain, some U.S. troops will remain in Iraq for years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin is bad for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I n a recent article (&quot;Once Elected, Palin Hired Friends and Lashed Foes,&quot; http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/us/politics/</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 14palin.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin) the New York Times reports that Gov. Sarah</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palin appears to be from the same school of secrecy and political cronyism that produced the current Bush-Cheney administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Palin, who had her frightening lack of preparedness in the arena of foreign affairs highlighted by the interview with Charles Gibson, now also appears to be the type of politician to play favorites, most notable by doling out high-paying jobs to high school friends (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/us/politics/14palin.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin) and letting her personal agenda interfere with state business (Vendetta row cant hold Sarah Palin back http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article4692408.ece). Her pattern of behavior is clearly apparent in the highly publicized case of State Trooper Mike Wooten, which also led to Palin's dismissal of then-public safety commissioner Walter Monegan, and the firing in July 2007 of her longtime political adviser John Bitney, who reportedly crossed Palin's husband, Todd Palin. Regardless of the perceived power lust apparent in big-time politics, is it not appropriate to condemn a candidate who puts personal agendas, grudges, and hubris ahead of public policy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gov. Palin and her top officials, according to the New York Times, also appear to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have taken a page out of the Karl Rove playbook while in Anchorage, by conspiring to use personal e-mail accounts (rather than their official government e-mail accounts) with the intention of subverting any future attempt to subpoena the e-mails as part of the public record. The e-mails in question were related to a controversial fight over whether polar bears should be considered endangered because of global climate change, a position sharply opposed by the governor (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/05/opinion/05palin.html).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John McCain, with his choice of Gov. Palin, tried to combat the popularity of Sen. Obama by finding his own celebrity, and America is still high on the possibility and novelty, albeit manufactured, of having a woman on the GOP ticket. However, John McCain, who claims to put country first, has chosen as his running mate a political hawk who not only has a history of vendetta-based actions, but who is also one of the tiniest percentage of Americans who still believe, despite all evidence to the contrary, that there is a link between Iraq and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. She stated in an address to soldiers shipping out to Iraq from Fort Wainwright, Alaska, that they would be fighting the enemies who planned and carried out and rejoiced in the death of thousands of Americans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Broomfield</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muniz's premise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> worthy of television</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I read with interest my friend Leonard Muniz's humorous dissertation on the merits of IQ as a requirement for the office of president in the Sept. 21 issue of the Enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was especially impressed with his examples of high IQ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidents:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Republican Richard Nixon, perpetrator of Watergate among other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democrat Bill Clinton whose nonexistent anti-terrorist policy's lead to 9/11, and whose financial policies are the main cause of the housing blowup (think Fannie Mae) and the current financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Way to go Leonard, you should be a writer for Letterman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maxine Coyle,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Broomfield</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palin's 'super job'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not all that super</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I n the Sept. 21 letters to the editor, Mr. Wooten writes, &quot;Gov. Sarah Palin did a super job in her TV interview with Charlie Gibson recently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well, I guess I would have to agree with that, if a &quot;super job&quot; referred to her ability to avoid directly answering almost every question Charlie Gibson asked her. She is super all right, super at avoiding admitting that she supported the &quot;bridge to nowhere&quot; for two years before she changed her mind to benefit her own political aspirations. Super, at saying that she said &quot;thanks but no thanks to Congress&quot; when she did not say any such thing. Super, at never admitting that she actually took the money from Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oh, and I thought her answer about her knowledge of foreign policy was just super, too. &quot;Well Charlie, you know, I can see Russia from one part of my state.&quot; Brilliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She really avoided the truth about the library books, too. She said that she never tried to burn any books. What she so cleverly left out was the fact that she tried to fire the librarian because the librarian would not take certain books that she (Palin) did not approve of off the shelves. And</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that she (Palin) withdrew from the move to fire said librarian when more than 100 people showed up to protest her (Palin's) actions against &quot;free speech.&quot; Super job of avoiding the truth ... again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And boy she really avoided the truth about her trip of a lifetime to Iraq, because she never got there. That is a fact, look it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Wooten also says Gov. Palin brought needed balance to the GOP ticket. Guess I would agree with him there, too. The polls right after the Republican convention showed that bringing Sarah Palin onto the Republican ticket, writing a speech for her full of lies and venom, that she delivered superbly, brought some white women onto the bandwagon. Yes sir, that went out and got those women who just had to vote for a woman, any woman. But the divide-and-conquer tactics that drove the poll numbers up did not last long after the real issues reared their ugly heads, again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, I would like to address Mr. Wooten's statement on qualifications. But, that statement is so far off the truth that it does not deserve comment. Everyone reading that statement can add up the years of experience and the list of qualifications that the other candidates have and see for themselves that Gov. Palin can't come close in either of those columns. I doubt that your political science professor was referring to a governor of two years, whose foreign policy is based on the fact that said governor can &quot;see Russia from some parts of her state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Wooten, you have certainly been fooled if you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can't see who first used the &quot;down in the gutter, low-class campaign tactics&quot; of this campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> God bless America and God bless Americans who can open their eyes and their minds and see that we need a man of integrity and intelligence, Barack Obama, to get this country out of the &quot;ditch&quot; and to be respected around the world once more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Betty Harris,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Broomfield</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High IQ or no, high</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taxes not smart</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have read many editorials written by Leonard Muniz, but the one published on Sept. 21, &quot;Party-line voting not all that smart&quot; was really over the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trying to get info on the Obama and McCain tax policy is very difficult on their respective Web sites. In searching the Web, I found two sites that are very credible explaining their proposals. The Tax Policy Center and The Tax Foundation. McCain says he will leave Bush's tax cuts in place and the first 10 years of his plan will collect $7 trillion dollars less in tax. Obama says he will shift taxes to the top 5 percent of the tax payers and his plan will collect $2.6 trillion dollars less in taxes the first 10 years. This sounds like a $4.4 trillion tax increase to me. The issue is how much in taxes people with a positive AGI (to you with low IQs that is adjusted gross income).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last year of finalized data on federal taxes is 2006. In 2006, 135.72 million people paid $1.02 trillion dollars in federal income taxes; 92.7 million of the tax returns actually paid taxes; 43 million people paid no federal taxes at all. The top 5 percent of earners paid 36.66 percent of the taxes and had an AGI of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Council now a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> giant HOA?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> B roomfield City Council has decided that all citizens of Broomfield are now required to live under the rules of an HOA. Reference Ordinance No. 1891. City Council has decided that city government is now going to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> be the appearance police and that any property that does not cosmetically appeal to their sense of beauty will be subject to fines. This will be completely at city government's discretion. They will decide when you have to replace your roof. They will decide when you must repaint your house. They will decide when you have to re-pour your concrete drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is this the government you want from your elected officials? Is this the government you want at a time when financial institutions are failing and your retirement funds are disappearing? Is this the government you want if you are living on a fixed income or are out of work? Are you interested in having your city government become that HOA busybody that turns on all the neighbors?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's not my idea of government. If it is not your idea of government, then call Louise Benson today at 303-465-4915 and sign the petition to revoke this onerous ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> George L. Blosser,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> W e have enjoyed Broomfield Days for many years -- the parade with the incomparable Paul Derda, the many merchants and nonprofits displaying their products, the food, rides, games, etc. But a service we noticed for the first time this year since our son and daughter-in-law have presented us with a 6-month-old granddaughter -- a diaper-changing and nursing station for new mothers. We appreciate very much all of the benefits available to us here in Broomfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Karen and Harv Kirkpatrick,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Put fire safety</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top of mind</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> H ow many times have you left the house in the morning and wondered, &quot;Did I turn off the stove?&quot; With our busy lives, the safety of our homes and families are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sometimes relegated to the back of our minds -- an afterthought as we hop in the car to start the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> North Metro Fire Rescue District wants you to make sure that the stove burner is turned off or the damaged electrical cord you've been meaning to fix is your top priority during Fire Prevention Week, Oct. 5-11. The theme of this year's campaign, &quot;Prevent Home Fires,&quot; focuses on preventing the leading causes of home fires -- cooking, heating and electrical equipment, and smoking materials. According to the latest statistics from the nonprofit National Fire Protection Association, there were an estimated 396,000 reported home structure fires in 2006, resulting in 2,580 civilian deaths, 12,500 civilian injuries and $6.8 billion in direct damage in the United States. Home fires caused 80 percent of civilian deaths and 76 percent of injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the statistics are daunting, most home fires are easily preventable when we narrow our focus and take personal steps to increase our safety. One way to do this is by proactively combing through each room in your home to find signs of danger and fix them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There also are a number of simple steps you can put into action to keep your home safe from fire:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cooking: Stay in the kitchen when you are frying, grilling or broiling food. If you leave the kitchen for even a short period time, turn off the stove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Heating: Keep all things that can burn, such as paper, bedding or furniture, at least 3 feet away from heating equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Electrical: Replace cracked and damaged electrical cords; use extension cords from temporary wiring only. Consider having additional circuits or receptacles added by a qualified electrician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smoking: If you smoke, smoke outside; wherever you smoke, use deep, sturdy ashtrays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As firefighters and fire safety educators, fire prevention is always on our minds. We hope that you use the checklist and home fire prevention tips to put your safety first during Fire Prevention Week, and year-round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John J. O'Hayre,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vote no on 3A, 3B</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> H omeowners in the Adams 12 school district pay the highest school taxes in the state. More precisely, compare two houses in Broomfield, one house in the 12500 block of Tammywood, Adams 12, to an equal house in the 1100 block of East Seventh Avenue, Boulder Valley. The Adams 12 house pays $458 more ($2,012 vs. $1,554).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The leaders of the Adams 12 school district want to raise taxes again. They need the money and they are sure the voters do not know they are already paying 1&frac12; times the school taxes the average Coloradan pays. There are other, less unfair ways the leaders of Adams 12 could get the money they need, but they will not take those approaches as long as they can get the easy money from ill-informed, overly generous, guilt-ridden voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the financial facts about Adams 12 were well known, it would make most people angry. The tax money that is collected in the name of the Adams 12 school district on the Target Store at 144th Avenue and Huron Street is $234,154, but the schools get less than $1,000. The story is the same for rest of the Orchard Shopping Center and the loss soars to millions dollars. This loss of money to Adams 12 is repeated at the Larkridge Shopping Center. Broomfield zones commercial property (i.e.: Flatirons), no students and hefty property taxes in the Boulder Valley School District, while Adams 12 gets the houses, students and less property tax. The leaders of Adams 12 have watched these injustices happen. Perhaps they were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> too timid or too tired to object. Perhaps they did not want to challenge their friends at city halls or in the business community. Perhaps they were reluctant to seek the assistance of state legislators to right these wrongs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have told several legislators of these problems for Adams 12. Two years ago, I shared these problems with Rep. Primavera, but it would have been much harder for her to advance her priorities if she exposed the hypocrisy of the self-proclaimed supporters of public education from the tax-rich school districts in Denver and Boulder. If the leaders of Adams 12 had also appealed to Rep. Primavera, maybe she might have set different priorities. If the district had appealed to Solano, Casso, Soper, Takis, Tochtrop and Mitchell, perhaps so many democratic and handsome voices might have had an impact. Like the Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of Oz, the leaders of Adams 12 need to be pushed to fight for the district. As long as the voters give easy money to Adams 12, they will not fight. One way the leaders of Adams 12 might fight for the district and appeal to state legislators is if the tax increase fails. Vote no on 3A and 3B.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">B:EDITORIAL</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">789 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I' ve been covering John McCain steadily for a decade. A few years ago, I worked on a book, which I foolishly never completed, on the U.S. Senate with McCain as the central character. So when I step back and think of McCain, even in the heat of this campaign, I still think of him first in the real world of governing, not in the show-business world of the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think first of the personal qualities. He was an unfailingly candid man. When other politicians described a meeting, they always ended up the heroes of the story. But McCain would always describe the meeting straight, emphasizing his own failings with more vigor than his accomplishments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is, for a politician, a humble man. The most important legacy of his prisoner-of-war days is that he witnessed others behaving more heroically than he did. This experience has given him a basic honesty when appraising himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His mood darkened as the Iraq war deteriorated, but his accomplishments mounted. I don't think any senator had as impressive a few years as McCain did during this span of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He lobbied relentlessly for a change of strategy in Iraq, holding off the tide that would have had us accept defeat and leave Iraq to its genocide. He negotiated a complicated immigration bill with Ted Kennedy. He helped organize the Gang of 14 and helped save the Senate from polarized Armageddon over judicial nominations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He voted against opportunist bills like the pork-laden energy package and the prescription drug plan. He led a crusade against Jack Abramoff and the sleaze-meisters in his own party and exposed corrupt Pentagon contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I could fill this column with his accomplishments during this period, and not even mention the insights. At a defense conference in Munich, I saw him diagnose and confront Russian hegemony. Week after week, I saw him dissent from GOP colleagues as their party lost its way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some people who cover the campaign seem to have no knowledge of anything but the campaign, but I can't get these events -- which were real and required the constant application of judgment, honor and courage -- out of my head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Do I wish he was running a different campaign? Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's not that he has changed his political personality that bothers me. I've come to accept that in this media-circus environment, you simply cannot run for president as a candid, normal person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nor is it, primarily, the dishonest ads he is running. My friends in the Obama cheering section get huffy about them, while filtering from their consciousness all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the dishonest ads Obama has run -- the demagogic DHL ad, the insulting computer ad, the cynical Rush Limbaugh ad, the misleading Social Security ad and so on. If one candidate has sunk lower than the other at this point, I've lost track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No, what disappoints me about the McCain campaign is it has no central argument. I had hoped that he would create a grand narrative explaining how the United States is fundamentally unprepared for the 21st century and how McCain's worldview is different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain has not made that sort of all-encompassing argument, so his proposals don't add up to more than the sum of their parts. Without a groundbreaking argument about why he is different, he's had to rely on tactical gimmicks to stay afloat. He has no frame to organize his response when financial and other crises pop up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has no overarching argument in part because of his Senate training and the tendency to take issues on one at a time -- in part, because of the foolish decision to run a traditional right-left campaign against Barack Obama and, in part, because McCain has never really resolved the contradiction between the Barry Goldwater and Teddy Roosevelt sides of his worldview. One day he's a small-government Western conservative; the next he's a Bull Moose progressive. The two don't add up -- as we've seen in his uneven reaction to the financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, when people try to tell me that the McCain on the campaign trail is the real McCain and the one who came before was fake, I just say, baloney. I saw him. A half-century of evidence is there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If McCain is elected, he will retain his instinct for the hard challenge. With that Greatest Generation style of his, he will run the least partisan administration in recent times. He is not a sophisticated conceptual thinker, but he is a good judge of character. He is not an organized administrator, but he has become a practiced legislative craftsman. He is, above all -- and this is completely impossible to convey in the midst of a campaign -- a serious man prone to serious things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amid the stupidity of this season, it seemed worth stepping back to recall the fundamentals -- about McCain today and Obama some other day in the near future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have owned the Fresh Fish Company in Denver for four years. I was able to put the money together to buy this restaurant after working there for 15 years. It gives me a great sense of pride that I was able to work my way up through the ranks and live the American dream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If even one of these four initiatives passes, my business may have to close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amendment 56 (mandatory health care) will force anyone who employs 20 or more people to pay 80 percent of the employee's health insurance costs, plus 70 percent of their dependents' health insurance. This would cost me an additional $9,000 per year, per employee. With my 5 percent profit margin (average for restaurants), I would need to generate an additional $180,000 per year, per employee to cover that cost. I am going out of business if Amendment 56 passes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amendments 53, 55 and 57 are purposefully worded so vaguely that it will take millions of dollars and years of work by trial lawyers to figure them out, all at businesses' expense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado restaurants generate approximately $575 million in state and local tax revenues. At a time when nearly every municipality in our state is strapped for cash and looking for ways to cover budget shortfalls, it doesn't seem prudent to put one of the largest tax-generating sectors of the economy out of business, does it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karen Kristopeit-Parker, Denver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amendments would make a mess of constitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Business, labor may defuse dueling ballot issues,&quot; Sept. 17 news story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was extremely relieved to see that some business and labor leaders are coming together to discuss ballot issues that have the potential to devastate Colorado. It's about time our community leaders come together to discuss the important issues facing our state. Whatever they decide moving forward, Coloradans should make note of who was at the discussion table and who was not. Business and labor leaders met in the middle and at least started a discussion, while extreme ideological interests continued to put their own narrow agenda first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Amendments 47, 49 and 54 pass this fall, no one will be left to blame for the mess it will create out of the Colorado Constitution but the people who continue to push them despite the damage it will do to our state - people like Jonathan Coors, Jon Caldara and Ryan Frazier. These supposed community leaders are not showing us any leadership on these issues. If they want to do what is right for Colorado, the backers of Amendments 47, 49 and 54 will join with Colorado's business and labors leaders, call this battle a draw, and stand down on their issues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disappointed in &quot;Ave. Q&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Avenue Q,&quot; a 2004 Tony Award winner, &quot;graced&quot; the stage of the Ellie Caulkins Opera House in Denver's Civic Center earlier this month. The opera house, being a party to this production, disappoints those who look to this venue as a last bastion of tastefulness rather than vulgarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Avenue Q&quot; is a putrid celebration of pornea and moral decay. The audience's roaring approbation was reminiscent of Sodom and Gomorrah. On steroids!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the wretchedness of the themes, even with characters and their puppets sporting yarmulkes, thereby inviting a hope of wholesomeness, &quot;Avenue Q&quot; begs the quintessential question: &quot;Is it a small thing to mock God?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Newell, Littleton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---------------------------------------- Media should object to candidates' falsehoods</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am discouraged and dismayed not merely by the persistent McCain television ads spouting claims that are objectively false, but more so by the media's passive acceptance of the practice. Unless outlets such as The Denver Post cause this to tactically backfire through strenuous objection as long as they are aired, then we are doomed not merely to more of the same, but dramatically worse in coming years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the GOP knows that they can buy whatever truth they can compose in an ad, without anyone to stand in their way, there will be few limits to what we will see next time around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please, show some backbone. Do not passively shrug your shoulders and reduce every disagreement to an ethically neutral &quot;he-said/</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">she-said&quot; surrender of your obligations. Objective facts demand no equal time with falsehoods. Sarah Palin did not stop the &quot;bridge to nowhere&quot;; she campaigned for it, bailed out when the going got tough, and kept the money besides. Don't let her buy a different story.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am confused why people are even considering putting the Republicans back in office. Why would they change if they win again? It will be the same people, same war (maybe a new one with Iran) and same policies favoring the oil fat cats. Barack Obama may not be the solution for everything, but he will be a deviation from the current direction. And if after four years you don't like that direction, you can vote him out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year from now we can have more of the same or a change. My family can't afford more of the same; I'm voting for a new direction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado employers, religious leaders and Gov. Bill Ritter converged at the statehouse in separate events Thursday with a message to the next president and Congress: Fix the nation's broken immigration system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal action is essential, they say, to defuse mounting frustrations - from uproar over a fatal auto wreck involving an illegal immigrant to business demands for more foreign workers to fuel the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that a lot of issues are queued up&quot; in Washington, Ritter said at the first of two gatherings. &quot;Immigration has to be something that the federal government tackles in, I would think, the first year of the new administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither John McCain nor Barack Obama has made immigration reform a priority in the presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado and national business leaders have launched a 60-second television ad airing this week in Denver and other Western cities - Phoenix, Albuquerque and Las Vegas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is expected to reach millions with a call for Congress to pass comprehensive immigration legislation. A national nonprofit, Mexicans and Americans Thinking Together, is coordinating the effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State lawmakers nationwide pass laws targeting illegal workers, yet &quot;they don't have any way to bring (legal) workers across the border,&quot; said Mike Gilsdorf, chairman of Colorado Employers for Immigration Reform and chief executive of Arapahoe Acres Nursery Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In return&quot; for federal action to bring enough foreign workers to fill advertised jobs that U.S. workers don't accept, &quot;we'll agree to e-verify (the immigration status of) every person we hire. If we don't do that, I think we deserve a jail sentence,&quot; Gilsdorf said. &quot;We don't want to hire illegals. But if we don't get the workers we need, we're in the corner. It's stupid for the U.S. government to put small business in that corner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some business groups, including the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, are noncommittal on whether employers should accept greater responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't think employers should have to be ICE (federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents&quot; in scrutinizing employees, said Kate Horle, the Denver chamber's spokeswoman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current federal law requires only a good-faith effort by employers to scan ID documents that often are forged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Thursday, interfaith religious leaders, with Ritter, unveiled &quot;Interfaith Pledge on Immigration&quot; cards to be distributed in churches across Denver, where new census data show 18.7 percent of residents are foreign-born. Coloradans signing cards would &quot;publicly reject the politics of division and isolation that fan anger and hate&quot; and commit to &quot;work toward just, workable and humane immigration reform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ritter, who attended only the meeting of religious leaders, favors increased cross-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">checking of federal immigration databases to make sure arrested illegal immigrants are deported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a senior U.S. Department of Homeland Security official has agreed that Colorado-based federal immigration agents &quot;will participate&quot; in a new effort to identify law enforcement gaps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 20 Colorado State Patrol troopers have been &quot;deputized&quot; to have access to federal databases, and increased access can be arranged by deputizing more, Ritter said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonizing oil industry is bad for America Democrat Mark Udall has a new ad in which his Republican rival for the Senate, Bob Schaffer, comments, &quot;That's the fun part,&quot; about his former job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the ominous way the ad makes Schaffer repeat the phrase over and over again, you'd think the man operates a meth house or a human slavery ring. But no, it's worse. At the time Schaffer was - gasp - an oil company executive!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This relentless demonizing of the oil and gas industry by the Democrats would be laughable if it weren't so disastrous for our nation. With America starving for energy, and Democrats in Congress (like Udall) for two decades forbidding exploration offshore and in the West's vast oil shale reserves, treating an oil company executive like a felon is akin to criminalizing farmers for providing food to the hungry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joy Overbeck, Kiowa </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experience isn't the issue in choosing a president</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm tired of all the talk, from both sides, concerning who's experienced to be president. As far as I can tell, the only person truly experienced as president is the sitting president. Since our constitution doesn't allow a president to run for more than two terms, we will always be electing an inexperienced person every four to eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I vote for a person to be president, I am not interested in that person's experience, be it mayor, governor or community organizer. I will be extremely interested in the issues the presidential candidates are running on. If I don't vote for Barack Obama, it won't be due to the color of his skin or the amount of experience he has. I won't vote for Obama because I don't want my taxes raised and I don't want people to receive handouts when what they really need is a hand up. And I for sure won't vote for someone who wants the U.S. to be like Europe or doesn't put a premium on the unborn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I plan on voting for John McCain. Again, I could care less about his experience. I care greatly that McCain will appoint Supreme Court justices who will look at the Constitution and its original meaning before voting on an issue before the court. I care greatly that we drill here as well as pursue other means of energy. I care greatly about the life of the unborn. I care greatly about the American way of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So count me out among those looking for an experienced presidential candidate. I'm more interested in a U.S.-first candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thor Johnson, Arvada</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Characterizing someone as being more fit to be president simply because he or she has more &quot;experience,&quot; especially &quot;executive experience,&quot; can be very misleading. Just because someone has been at a certain job for a long time does not always mean that they are a more capable person. Nor does being a governor automatically mean that you're presidential material. George W. Bush had &quot;executive experience&quot; as governor of Texas, and look what that got us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we're going to judge candidates on whether or not they're fit to be president, it should be based on their overall knowledge or our country and the world in general, as well as their capacity for good judgment, fairness, and true empathy for those less well off. Maybe I'm just being na&iuml;ve, but I would truly feel safer and have more trust in our executive branch if I felt that the guy leading our country was actually smarter than me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current occupant of the White House fails miserably in all those criteria, as does the combined McCain/Palin ticket.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;'09 budget forces cuts in Aurora,&quot; Sept. 18 news story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closing libraries is not the way to have an informed citizenry. Yet the city of Aurora, serving a population of some 300,000 people plus students at the Community College of Aurora, is considering further limiting hours at its main library, possibly closing one day a week, and eliminating its only library in the Adams County part of the city - Chambers Plaza Library at East Colfax Avenue and Chambers Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the economy slowed down, there is an even greater demand for libraries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not every household can afford a computer, and those at the libraries are in great demand, with frequent need to wait for opportunity to use them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hoped that the Aurora City Council will take a closer look at library funding, not just for today but for the community's future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read William Porter's column with great interest. My wife and I own the independent Ace Hardware store at 417 S. Broadway, just up the street from General Hardware. Our Ace store opened in July 2006 and we have experienced an awesome outpouring of support from the South Broadway community as well as the nearby Baker, Washington Park and Platt Park neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We opened our store just a few hundred yards from the Home Depot location on Santa Fe Drive because we believe independent, service-oriented businesses can thrive in the same market as the &quot;big boxes.&quot; In our store, customers are the No. 1 priority. We offer services such as screen repair, glass cutting and lock servicing, which are not available in big box stores. Our employees use radio headsets to guide sales associates to customers who need advice or assistance and to leverage the knowledge of the whole staff for each customer's need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To keep our inventory turns higher and remain profitable, we special order hard-to-find items for customers rather than keep them idle on the shelves. To give customers a great shopping experience, we keep our store bright and clean. We serve coffee every morning and popcorn all day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe aggressive independent businesses that listen to their customers, continually innovate, and stay fresh and relevant will always thrive in the American economy. Mr. Porter's article has inspired me to ensure my successors never read the same article about my business.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's plan would worsen health care</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 47 million Americans without health insurance, can it get worse? With Sen. John McCain's plan, it can. His plan shifts toward individual plans. Individual coverage tends to be the most expensive as well as the most discriminatory. Moreover, his plan lacks any provision for dealing with the pre-existing condition practices that have become commonplace. Consequently, having a higher number of people who can't afford or obtain health insurance is a real possibility under this plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AURORA - A sixth-grader will be back in class today, three school days after he was suspended for causing a disruption for wearing a T-shirt that said Barack Obama was terrorist-friendly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daxx Dalton, an 11-year-old at Aurora Frontier K-8 school, wore the T-shirt he and his father, Dann, made for an assembly Thursday that honored Medal of Honor winners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students were urged to wear something patriotic, with no homework as a carrot. So Daxx and his dad made the red, white and blue T-shirt that read: &quot;Obama, A Terrorist's Best Friend.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While on the school playground that morning, Daxx and other students got into a shouting match over the shirt, Superintendent John Barry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the argument spilled into first-period math class, Daxx was sent to the principal's office. He was given the option of turning the shirt inside out, wearing a shirt provided by the school or going home and changing into something else and coming back to class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daxx didn't like any of those options, so district officials suspended him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his Aurora home Tuesday, Daxx said his dad came up with the idea for the T-shirt, adding that he hadn't been following the election very closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't understand that much to have an opinion,&quot; Daxx said. &quot;I just follow my dad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear where Dann Dalton's allegiance sits. He is a John McCain supporter, he said. The storm door at his home has a bumper sticker that says, &quot;We vote pro-life,&quot; and he recalled taking Daxx to an anti-abortion rally when the boy was 2 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am full of anti-Obama cliches,&quot; Dalton said. &quot;I just picked one that would be easy to replicate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that his son's First Amendment rights were violated and that he may file a lawsuit against Aurora Public Schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea that free speech is in someone else's hands ... is just something I am not going to tolerate,&quot; Dalton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barry said Daxx was not suspended for what he wore but because, according to school policy, &quot;any type of attire which attracts undue attention to the wearer, and thus causes disturbance to the educational process, is in bad taste and not acceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also is against district policy to wear clothes that can &quot;cause or are likely to cause a material and substantial disruption to the educational process or school-related activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barry noted that Daxx's sister also wore an anti-Obama T-shirt to the same school that day but she was not suspended because it did not cause a &quot;disruption of instruction&quot; as Daxx's shirt had done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a district, we are concerned about the educational process and not whether students hold liberal or conservative views,&quot; Barry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether intended or not, the T-shirt brought a lot of attention to the Daltons. The two were making the media rounds Tuesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> settling all difficulties, great or</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said without even looking around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- &quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WASHINGTON -- Under the pressure of the financial crisis, one presidential candidate is behaving like a flustered rookie playing in a league too high. It is not Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Channeling his inner Queen of Hearts, John McCain furiously, and apparently without even looking around at facts, said Chris Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, should be decapitated. This childish reflex provoked The Wall Street Journal to editorialize that &quot;McCain untethered&quot; -- disconnected from knowledge and principle -- had made a &quot;false and deeply unfair&quot; attack on Cox that was &quot;unpresidential&quot; and demonstrated that McCain &quot;doesn't understand what's happening on Wall Street any better than Barack Obama does.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To read the Journal's details about the depths of McCain's shallowness on the subject of Cox's chairmanship, see &quot;McCain's Scapegoat&quot; (Sept. 19, Page A22). Then consider McCain's characteristic accusation that Cox &quot;has betrayed the public's trust.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps an old antagonism is involved in McCain's fact-free slander. His most conspicuous economic adviser is Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who previously headed the Congressional Budget Office. There he was an impediment to conservatives, including then-Congressman Cox, who as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee persistently tried and generally failed to enlist CBO support for &quot;dynamic scoring&quot; that would estimate the economic growth effects of proposed tax cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In any case, McCain's smear -- that Cox &quot;betrayed the public's trust&quot; -- is a harbinger of a McCain presidency. For McCain, politics is always operatic, pitting people who agree with him against those who are &quot;corrupt&quot; or &quot;betray the public's trust,&quot; two categories that seem to be exhaustive -- there are no other people. McCain's Manichaean worldview drove him to his signature legislative achievement, the McCain-Feingold law's restrictions on campaigning. Today, his campaign is creatively finding interstices in laws intended to restrict campaign giving and spending. (For details, see The Washington Post of Sept. 17, Page A4; and The New York Times of Sept. 20, Page One.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By a Gresham's Law of political discourse, McCain's Queen of Hearts intervention in the opaque financial crisis overshadowed a solid conservative complaint from the Republican Study Committee, chaired by Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chairman Ben Bernanke, the RSC decried the improvised torrent of bailouts as a &quot;dangerous and unmistakable precedent for the federal government both to be looked to and indeed relied upon to save private sector companies from the consequences of their poor economic decisions.&quot; This letter, listing just $650 billion of the perhaps more than $1 trillion in new federal exposures to risk, was sent while McCain's campaign, characteristically substituting vehemence for coherence, was airing an ad warning that Obama favors &quot;massive government, billions in spending increases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The political left always aims to expand the permeation of economic life by politics. Today, the efficient means to that end is government control of capital. So, is not McCain's party now conducting the most leftist administration in American history? The New Deal never acted so precipitously on such a scale. Treasury Secretary Paulson, asked about conservative complaints that his rescue program amounts to socialism, said, essentially: This is not socialism, this is necessary. That non sequitur might be politically necessary, but remember that government control of capital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government control of capitalism. Does McCain have qualms about this, or only quarrels?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On &quot;60 Minutes&quot; Sunday evening, McCain, saying &quot;this may sound a little unusual,&quot; said that he would like to replace Cox with Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic attorney general of New York who is the son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo. McCain explained that Cuomo has &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;prestige&quot; and could &quot;lend some bipartisanship.&quot; Conservatives have been warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conservatives who insist that electing McCain is crucial usually start, and increasingly end, by saying he would make excellent judicial selections. But the more one sees of his impulsive, intensely personal reactions to people and events, the less confidence one has that he would select judges by calm reflection and clear principles, having neither patience nor aptitude for either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is arguable that, because of his inexperience, Obama is not ready for the presidency. It is arguable that McCain, because of his boiling moralism and bottomless reservoir of certitudes, is not suited to the presidency. Unreadiness can be corrected, although perhaps at great cost, by experience. Can a dismaying temperament be fixed?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Zogby/Williams Poll,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> September 2004</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A lot of people don't put a lot of stake in polls, but during an election season, they can be -- if not exactly accurate prognosticators -- illuminating. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First: The Palin bump. Gov. Sarah Palin, the maverick vice presidential choice by Sen. John McCain, certainly was a surprise choice. A surprise to many on the right, who had barely heard of her before. Mostly, she served as a cold-water shock to Sen. Barack Obama supporters, who had gotten a little too comfortably smug with their candidate's seemingly strong lead in the race for the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Notably -- and sociologists who study gender will be talking about this for years to come -- she struck an important chord with white women voters. They like her folksy &quot;story,&quot; which is what voters are calling past legislative and political histories these days. They show up in droves to McCain/Palin events, carrying signs with slogans like &quot;Guns, God and Lipstick.&quot; (Happily, only two of the three are supported by constitutional law.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the strange part is the conversion of past Sen. Hillary Clinton supporters, many of whom switched their allegiances from the Democrats to the McCain/Palin ticket. A Washington Post/ABC News poll stated that before the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Obama held an 8-point lead with white women voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After Palin's wildly popular speech at the Republican convention, McCain was ahead by 12 points among white women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even though, it has been noted ad nauseum, Palin is Sen. Clinton's opposite in every way but her gender. And don't forget that the &quot;Palin ticket&quot; includes McCain, who is against fair pay legislation, something the majority of women of all color support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that was two weeks ago, ancient history in an election year. This week's financial crisis -- and it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a major crisis -- gave a boost to Obama in polls by Gallup, and CBS News/ New York Times, even though McCain had been leading overall just two weeks ago. The fact is: The economy wasn't that great two weeks ago, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you really want to see some fickle voting behavior (hint: you don't) just wait to see if there's an &quot;October surprise&quot; that sends voters from one side over to the other. Charlie Black, with the McCain campaign, said in June that another terrorist attack would be an advantage for McCain. Black was assailed by just about everyone for suggesting as much, but he was talking about the reality of voting-with-your-gut behavior. Both sides like to paint the other as &quot;flip-floppers,&quot; someone who says he supports one thing, and then does another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in the end, it may well be the voters' flip-flopping gut decisions that get us into the most trouble. Four years ago, voters went with their guts. The results of that have been beyond dismal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Are you listening to the candidates, their platforms, their records and their plans? Or that little voice inside?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">T he financial crisis gripping the U.S. has the largest banks and insurance companies begging for massive government bailouts. The banking, investment, finance and insurance industries, long the foes of taxation, now need money from working-class taxpayers to stay alive. Taxpayers should be in the driver's seat now. Instead, decisions that will cost people for decades are being made behind closed doors, by the wealthy, by the regulators and by those they have failed to regulate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday, the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury Department agreed to a massive, $85 billion bailout of AIG, the insurance giant. This follows the abrupt bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the 158-year-old investment bank; the distressed sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America; the bailout of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; the collapse of retail bank IndyMac; and the federally guaranteed buyout of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase. AIG was deemed &quot;too big to fail,&quot; with 103,000 employees and more than $1 trillion in assets. According to regulators, an unruly collapse could cause global financial turmoil. U.S. taxpayers now own close to 80 percent of AIG, so the orderly sale of AIG will allow the taxpayers to recoup their money, the theory goes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's not so easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The financial crisis will most likely deepen. More banks and giant financial institutions could collapse. Millions of people bought houses with shady subprime mortgages and have already lost or will soon lose their homes. The financiers packaged these mortgages into complex &quot;mortgage-backed securities&quot; and other derivative investment schemes. Investors went hog-wild, buying these derivatives with more and more borrowed money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nomi Prins used to run the European analytics group at Bear Stearns and also worked at Lehman Brothers. &quot;AIG was acting not simply as an insurance company,&quot; she told me. &quot;It was acting as a speculative investment bank/hedge fund, as was Bear Stearns, as was Lehman Brothers, as is what will become Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. So you have a situation where it's (the U.S. government) ... taking on the risk of items it cannot even begin to understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As these high-rolling gamblers are losing all their banks' money, it comes to the taxpayer to bail them out. A better use of the money, says Michael Hudson, professor of economics at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, and an economic adviser to Rep. Dennis Kucinich, would be to &quot;save these 4 million homeowners from defaulting and being kicked out of their houses. Now they're going to be kicked out of the houses. The houses will be vacant. The cities are going to (lose) property taxes, they're going to have to cut back local expenditures, local infrastructure. The economy is being sacrificed to pay the gamblers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meltdown is a bipartisan affair. Presidential contenders John McCain and Barack Obama each have received millions of dollars from these very companies that are collapsing and are receiving the corporate welfare. President Clinton and his Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin (now an Obama economic adviser) presided over the repeal in 1999 of the Glass-Steagall Act, passed after the Great Depression of 1929 to curb speculation that caused that calamity. The repeal was pushed through by former Republican Sen. Phil Gramm, one of McCain's former top advisers. Politicians are too dependent on Wall Street to do anything. The people who vote for them, and whose taxes are being handed over to these failed financiers, are the ones who need to show their outrage and demand their leaders truly put &quot;country first&quot; and bring about &quot;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snapshots</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T his week, insurance giant AIG was added to the string of companies to get some sort of government bailout to help fight collapse. What do you think of the government's involvement with the financial sector? What do you think the government's role in this financial crisis should be?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That question was posed this week to the Camera's editorial advisory board and virtual editorial board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When I applied </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for my first home mortgage 30 years ago, you would have thought I was applying to be a CIA agent. The prove-I-was-creditworthy process was daunting. I had to submit previous tax returns, a notarized letter from the president of my company confirming my employment and salary, a personal budget substantiating the payments would not exceed 25 percent of my after-tax income, and a 20 percent down-payment cashier's check. My financial situation was scrutinized more carefully than Sarah Palin's VP qualifications!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent years, however, obtaining a mortgage has no longer required one penny down (you could even get money back), a job (invent one), or verifiable income (claim whatever you want). Is it any wonder so many mortgages are going unpaid? Fannie and Freddie guaranteed these notes and AIG traded heavily in them, thus weakening each institution's relative financial position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We need a permanent fix: stricter rules governing our financial institutions, closer oversight, and gutsy, disciplined leaders willing to say no to Wall Street &quot;greed-meisters&quot; and restore confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jimmy Calano</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To let AIG fail,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the whole U.S. economy could have collapsed. We all depend on insurance to protect ourselves, our homes, our families, our businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fundamental problems were in plain view. They included growing national debt, the government's current account deficit, a record level of personal debt, the inflated and overvalued housing market, devaluation of the dollar, transfer of wealth to oil dictatorships, and to China, and rising inequality in wages, plus outsourcing of jobs and industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is easy to blame the current turbulence in the American financial market on the government and the congress that did not act sooner, the regulating agencies that did not regulate, and the inventive corporate managers who devised schemes to enrich themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the general public is also at fault because we chose to ignore the signs that should have informed us that action was needed. If action had been taken early enough, the current catastrophe could have been avoided or at least curtailed. If only the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department had previously demanded that these institutions provide transparency and clarity, we might not be in the current quagmire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regardless of the party one favors, we are seeing in the result of a failed economic philosophy of the last eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Remember the &quot;welfare queen&quot; that President Reagan memorably complained about? According to Reagan, this woman came to collect her checks while driving her Cadillac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now it is the bankers who are riding their chauffeur-driven Mercedes to the White House to ask for their checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marc Raizman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current world-banking crisis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is largely the result of banks aggressively issuing risky mortgages during a bullish real estate market. If borrowers defaulted, the vultures could simply repossess the homes and sell them at a profit. Sweet!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when the real estate bubble predictably burst, banks found themselves holding more debt than the real estate was worth. Bummer. Trouble is, now that they're too big to fail without collapsing the entire economy, the government must bail them out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Bush's last-minute attempt now to use the U.S. Treasury to simply purchase all the bad mortgages via the world lending system is sad and embarrassing proof of his party's blind free-market ideology that sees regulation of the financial system as only necessary after the damage has already occurred. It's time to throw the bums out! Just like Hoover had no excuse when he and his Republican-controlled congress sunk us into a depression, George Bush and his cronies have no excuse now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's crucial that we elect Obama, who sounded the alarm months ago about the need for greater regulation. Don't count on McCain's newfound pitchfork-wielding populism to save us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Julian Friedland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With lax or nonexistent regulatory oversight,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the &quot;trickle-down&quot; theory has been turned on its head, becoming the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;suck-up&quot; theory: petty crooks sign up American dreamers (it's hard to blame</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ) to back-loaded subprime mortgages, then, to earn their bonuses, the suspect deals are rinsed clean of known defects and sold to &quot;rocket scientist&quot; mortgage security bundlers, who, to earn their bonuses, without asking any questions, re-sort them and sell the even more impenetrable bonds as sound investments through trusted firms of long-standing reputation, whose executives award themselves millions in bonuses after successfully off-loading all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Willie Sutton, when asked why he robbed banks, said, &quot;because that's where the money is.&quot; Modern thieves, wearing Armani suits and silk ties, are robbing us with spreadsheets instead of guns. Nothing has trickled down but the losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even if our only objective is to get our economy back on track, it is insane to give the lion's share of rebates and other tax incentives to people who hire financial advisors to manage their assets. Tax cuts and rebates should be given to people who will use the money to buy food, clothing and shelter, steering our market economy in directions that better serve the vast majority of the American public and the world. The &quot;suck-ups&quot; should go to prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ed Byrne</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What's missing in the current scenario</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a coherent strategy to make our fragile and brittle financial system more resilient and robust. The administration and Fed are now jumping from ad hoc to system-wide bailouts - the proposed RTC II, short selling limits, and money market funds guarantees - but are not using this leverage to force the players to accept additional regulation. And recent mergers are making the &quot;too big to fail&quot; problem even worse. In the '80's, RTC sold foreclosed properties owned by local S&amp;Ls, but the current toxic pools of mortgage backed securities are owned by institutions worldwide. Setting price and imposing moral hazard will be much more difficult for RTC II. Lobbyists and lawyers will be eating well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A return to the Glass-Steagall separation between investment and commercial banks would be a start, but more is needed to insulate the parts of the financial system from one another. Imposing limits on sales of pooled mortgages, addressing issues created by &quot;mark to market&quot; pricing, demanding higher capital requirements, and limiting third party insurance of investments all are potential steps. But separating risks is the key, with AIG a case in point. Apparently their regulated insurance/annuity business is doing just fine. It was their unregulated insuring of mortgage instruments that got them into trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our high-risk high-debt financial system is not a basis for a real economy. It allowed the rich to get richer while the middle class stagnated, and now the rest of us will pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steve Pomerance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did American's have an extra $85 billion to spend? The Treasury is hard at work today as it revs up the printing press to bail out not only Corporate America but WE THE PEOPLE from our poor decisions. Yes, it was them relaxing their standards so that they could profit from lending us money. However, it was us spending money we didn't have in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We bought larger homes, High Definition TVs, Wiis, iPods, iPhones, gas guzzlers, elective surgeries, and a whole host of other &quot;necessities.&quot; We opened up our home equity wallets and spent from it until it was tapped out. Now our homes are valued less than we owe, our spending has outpaced our incomes and we're desperate for someone to bail us out from our poor decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We should let AIG and the companies like them fall. We should then tighten our own belts and take the economic impact head on. Only then will we learn the lesson that $85 billion is a lot of money we can't afford to spend again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> now, not later</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T he two leading candidates for president -- who are both U.S. senators elected to pass laws -- are out prancing around the country telling us how they will change the way things are done in Washington. This is occurring at a time when the economy is tanking, businesses (including major banks) are failing, and the government is bailing out other businesses. I may not be from Missouri, but I like their &quot;show me&quot; attitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need change now, not next year. If you are honest about change, how about going back to your desk and doing your job in Congress that you've already been elected to do, which is to pass legislation. That is how you can win my vote, by doing your job now to effectuate change now. But wait, that is not how things are done in an election year, they will say. Again, if your major theme is about change and not doing things as they've always been done in the past, now is your chance to show us you really mean it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and critters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am writing this letter to express my opinion on bike paths and prairie dogs. In regard to bike paths, I think they are great and Boulder has many for people to enjoy. I do have a problem though, when the city takes people's property by eminent domain and cuts down trees to build new paths. This is what is happening at the condominium complex where I live. We are losing part of our property, and tall trees will be cut down to accommodate a new bike path at 28th and Valmont.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now prairie dogs, Valmont Park is a lovely park that has plenty of room for people and prairie dogs. The city plans to use the prairie dog area for recreation development. Don't we already have enough recreational area? Why can't they just leave it alone and let the prairie dogs be? The park currently serves as a great place for children to play and learn about prairie dogs at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Valmont Butte is toxic because of the human race. It is not the prairie dog's fault that people poisoned the land. The prairie dogs there are to be killed. The Health Department gave the OK for them to be relocated, but the Department of Wildlife will not allow their relocation. Strange, I thought the Department of Wildlife was there for protection, not killing. At least the fire department is relocating their prairie dogs to accommodate a new training center. Maybe these departments should switch roles?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anyway, people's private property should not be taken</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> away, and coexistence with wildlife is badly needed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> God didn't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> use computers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> B arack Obama is an &quot;anti-cursive-ite!&quot; His latest ad makes fun of John McCain for not being able to type e-mails. That is &quot;anti-cursive-ism&quot; plain and simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doesn't Mr. Obama understand our founding fathers wrote the Constitution freehand and that they learned many righteous principles to help govern our nation from earlier &quot;nontypists&quot; like Moses, King David, Solomon and St. Paul. Right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> God, as we know, is smarter than Bill Gates. He could have invented a computer or e-mail, but no, he chose to write his commandments by hand into stone tablets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some liken Obama to Jesus, but he never did e-mail. Jesus used his finger to write on the ground a message to accusers of a woman caught in the act of adultery, correct?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also read that believers' names are written in the book of life, not typed onto some &quot;floppy disk.&quot; This act will continue long after both candidates have died of old age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, don't think that because I'm a grey-haired, girthy, old grand-fatherly geezer that I can't type. I can! In fact, I don't like to brag, but just before I retired over a decade ago, I caught my secretary typing with all 10 of her fingers, whereas, I only need two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Being an &quot;anti-cursive-ite&quot; is worse than sending a message hand-written in lipstick.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Long-term effects</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to save lives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother and I have seen plenty of violence in this world in my lifetime. Recently I have seen an ad on TV that actually pokes fun at a member of Congress for voting for a Department of Peace. I was shocked, and in disbelief I turned to my friend and said &quot;how could anyone be against peace?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It seems that whenever we go to war the idea is to protect our country so that we can live in peace and it seems a Department of Peace makes perfect sense. So I checked them out at www.ThePeaceAlliance.org and this is what I found out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People who support a Department of Peace really support things such as better national security, fiscally responsible government, reduced violent crime, safer schools, safer homes and proactive rather than reactive policy-making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They remind us that it is much more cost effective to invest in peace-building and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violence prevention than to address the outcomes of violence (domestic violence, school violence, war). A cabinet-level Department of Peace will build and promote domestic programs to prevent and reduce interpersonal violence in the U.S. (e.g., child and partner abuse, school shootings, gangs, criminal violence) that drains our economy of anywhere from $300 billion to $500 billion per year. It will also promote international peace-building efforts that could reduce the approximate $750 billion annual cost of military involvement in international violent conflicts. The long-term effect of these programs will save lives, return over a trillion dollars to our economy and make international peace-building a national priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This sounds good to me, and I think we need to encourage all of our members of Congress to support this department and work toward peace for everyone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T here are several reasons to deplore the rash of bailouts of failing banks on Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For years, many of the bankers on Wall Street have managed to avoid paying income tax on their enormous profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why use taxpayer debt to perpetuate the reign of these people who have created such problems?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Infusion of new rescue-debt into a system, which is already choking on debt, will not cure the disease. It will merely postpone the crash, making it even worse when it finally hits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, my main concern is for the welfare of the rich bankers themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ill-advised bailouts deprive these individuals of the valuable lessons of poverty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many brands of truth. Some are poetic truths, others are political truths and some are staggering exaggerations - or what politicians frequently refer to as &quot;talking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, there is an outbreak of artificial indignation over the &quot;lies&quot; of Republicans. John McCain, claims Barack Obama's national press secretary Bill Burton, has run the &quot;sleaziest and least honorable campaign in modern presidential campaign history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ouch. We can attribute one of the following to this claim: 1) Burton has just landed on the planet Earth; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2) Burton is attempting to manipulate the media; 3) Burton is &quot;lying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I pick 2. After all, we've all heard the self-serving myth that pits helpless, meek, high-minded, issue-oriented Democrats against mendacious and mean Republicans, who not only detest America - especially children and small vulnerable creatures - but will lie and cheat to keep all oppressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts betray a more equitable story. And it starts with Sarah Palin's assertion that she said &quot;thanks, but no thanks&quot; to the infamous &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; and opposed earmarks. This is an elastic political truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technically, she did stop the project after initially supporting it. She has taken earmarks - even lobbied for them while mayor of Wasilla. As governor, though, Palin also vetoed over 300 wasteful projects and made an attempt to reform the process. Her record on earmarks is mixed, but by any measure, it's far superior to either Democratic candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, if this Palin claim can be classified as an untruth, Obama can be called a &quot;liar&quot; just as easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take, if you will, the foundational assertion of Obama's entire campaign that he is the candidate of post-partisan change. Obama, meanwhile, voted with fellow Democrats 96 percent of the time in Washington. And the bipartisan achievement he most often cites, an ethics reform bill, was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unanimous: &quot;... being in complete harmony or accord.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, then, &quot;Unity&quot; should be referred to as a poetic truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when much of the media acts as if it is personally offended by a questionable McCain&nbsp;ad accusing Obama of voting for a bill that would have provided sex education to kindergartners, you feel the pain. It was, indeed, a massive stretch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It reminds me of the Obama&nbsp;ad that accuses McCain of having &quot;voted to cut education funding&quot; and &quot;proposed&quot; the abolishment of the Department of Education despite neither being true. Not much anger at that one. Just a lot of talk about the media's responsibility to keep candidates honest. And absolutely, journalists have a responsibility to put every single candidate through the wringer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So maybe, when ABC's Charlie Gibson has the chance to chit-chat with Obama, he can ask him - twice - how, with his dearth of experience and his own 2004 &quot;lie&quot; that he would &quot;serve out my full six-year term&quot; in the Senate - whether he really, truly, actually believes he is ready for the job of the presidency. Or did he blink? Ever?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when the Palin inspection is over, and Americans know how many moose burgers she's ingested and every federal cent she has ever requested, cable news shows can begin panel discussions regarding Joe Biden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They can examine the Democratic VP nominee's relationship with credit-card giant MBNA. Someone might even ask Biden why he backed legislation promoted by the credit-card industry and opposed by watchdog groups while his son was a lobbyist for MBNA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This question, it seems, at the very least deserves as much attention as Palin's teenage daughter's pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because, of course, no one is innocent in politics. Nor does any party, despite what you may have heard, occupy the moral high ground.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> uring this September of our dissonance, the nation feasts on all things Sarah. News sources, Web sites and the cacophony of cable chatter, on both sides of the chasm, are peddling Palin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E-mail missives, many nasty, unfounded and unpublishable, most sent by women, engorge the Internet. More than a hundred landed in my mailbox during the weekend. Some women write daily. Tuesday brought &quot;Women against Sarah Palin/Please sign petition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like that will alter the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is anyone talking about John McCain or Barack Obama? Aren't we supposed to direct our attention toward the candidates' serious differences on education, health care, fiscal recovery and foreign policy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apparently not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many women, and the men vying for women's attention, are too busy assailing or defending the Republican vice-presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like the alpha girls of junior high, women are dwelling on Palin's looks, her children, her voice. Her story has become the hit drama of the new fall season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We've regressed to the locker room of life, where women engage in combat daily, catfights in kitten heels, as in Clare Boothe Luce's &quot;The Women.&quot; In the pallid remake, the women -- the right ones, educated and established -- fight back at a &quot;spritzer girl,&quot; the upstart perfume saleswoman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As in the movie, the political pig-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in-lipstick imbroglio also concerns class, reviving one of the greatest hits of the culture war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After their speed date, John McCain selected Sarah Palin not due to experience or compatibility, but because she's the woman who completes him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whereas he is 72, irreligious, average-looking, rich and physically limited, the Alaska governor is young, religious, photogenic, middle-class and active, with a moose of a narrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I hoped we had moved beyond the dumb emphasis on narrative to the issues and solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How girl of me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain cynically chose Palin in the belief that women vote with their ovaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How small to think we would bond with a candidate we barely know when our only shared traits are motherhood, glasses, and the ability to produce estrogen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The battle this engenders among women underscores, despite hollow bromides to the contrary, how few have reached the upper echelon of politics. To attack Palin, McCain's camp argues, is to attack all women, rather than, say, these Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Know what I think? This is a monumental distraction. Women are attacking women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Does this make us look good? No, it does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's girl-on-girl crime, though plenty of men are in the fight, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Should women be so mad at Sarah Palin, an ambitious politician offered the chance of a lifetime? Wouldn't they be better served directing their enmity toward the man who chose her?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Republican's latest salvo is playing the victim card, trumpeting Palin's girliness. &quot;As Obama drops in the polls,&quot; the announcer says in McCain's latest ad, after showing wolves on the hunt, &quot;he'll try to destroy her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oh, John, please save Sarah!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain's selection of Palin initially seemed foolish, given how she upstages him. Increasingly, it seems like a masterstroke of diversionary tactics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has argued that McCain doesn't understand voter concern about the foundering economy and -- attention, Michigan voters -- has refused to support loan guarantees for the auto industry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If any of those statements rings true, then a campaign adage has proven itself again: repeat something often enough, and it becomes real, even when it isn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political innocents may wonder why a candidate like McCain, whose campaign is premised on what he calls &quot;straight talk&quot; -- and to a lesser extent Obama -- have veered from the flat truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The answer is simple: Because it works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both major party candidates for president vowed to run a different kind of campaign, implicitly promising a break from the spin-fests that past campaigns had become. But the close race and the tumultuous media environment in which McCain and Obama now find themselves appear to have crushed those notions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts who have studied campaign rhetoric point out that rhetorical excess is hardly new. Plato railed against it 2,500 years ago. But even he might have been taken aback this year, particularly by McCain and his running mate's recent comments and advertisements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Saturday, the McCain team was on the defensive after the Boston Globe reported that Palin's 2007 trip to Iraq, which the campaign had forwarded as evidence of foreign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy experience, was actually a trip to a Kuwait-Iraq border crossing. The campaign earlier had said the trip -- her only one outside North America -- included a visit to Ireland, but later acknowledged that was a refueling stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain himself added to the list of whoppers on Friday. On ABC's &quot;The View,&quot; he said that Palin would help him put a stop to pork projects known as &quot;earmarks,&quot; which are put into the budget without public review by members of Congress. When co-host Barbara Walters noted that Palin herself has requested earmarks, McCain inaccurately responded, &quot;No, not as governor she didn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, she requested almost $200 million in earmarks this year as governor, atop millions more when she was mayor of the small town of Wasilla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain also brushed back criticism of two misleading ads released by his campaign this week -- one that attacked Obama on sex education and another that said he equated her with a pig. Both ads have been debunked by independent analysts. FactCheck called the sex education ad &quot;simply false&quot; and said along with others that Obama was talking about McCain's reform strategy, not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palin, when he said the campaign was putting &quot;lipstick on a pig.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On &quot;The View&quot;, co-host Joy Behar asked McCain about the ads, calling them &quot;lies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Actually they are not lies,&quot; McCain replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain and his campaign have insisted that all of their complaints about Obama are grounded in fact, as Obama has when confronted with errors in his criticisms of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this presidential campaign, as in others before it, words can be shaded in a variety of ways -- direct falsehoods, technically accurate but misleading statements, incendiary suggestions or cherry-picked information lacking necessary context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Careful attention to the wording is key.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain and Palin have emphasized her reformist credentials by saying she put the Alaska state plane for sale on eBay; McCain went so far as to say she sold it for a profit. Actually, the plane did not find a buyer on eBay and was later sold for a loss by a broker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On some level, truth or fiction has come to be almost beside the point, since the claims all take root.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Republican political analyst Dan Schnur noted that the current media environment allows misstatements from both sides to skitter through the Internet and onto ideologically-based cable and radio shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sites like FactCheck, a project of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, also seek to clarify public comments by candidates, to growing response from voters. Jackson, the project's director, said well over a million people visited the site last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His organization, nonpartisan and nonprofit, seeks to smother heated campaign rhetoric with the cool weight of logic. No use of the word &quot;lie,&quot; for example, since intent is hard to divine; rather, something erroneous is judged &quot;less than honest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I can't be sure if they are being cynically manipulative or being bamboozled by their own rhetoric,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Take the sex education ad. McCain's ad ominously contends that Obama's single accomplishment in education was &quot;legislation to teach comprehensive sex education to kindergartners.&quot; In fact, the measure would have allowed teachers, with parental approval, to inform young children about the dangers of inappropriate touching by adults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama was not the measure's author, and the bill ultimately failed, meaning that it was not an accomplishment for anyone, much less Obama.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TORONTO-- Matt Damon says the selection of Sarah Palin as the Republican nominee for vice president could end up &quot;like a really bad Disney movie&quot; if John McCain wins the November presidential election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You do the actuary tables, there's a one out of three chance, if not more, that McCain doesn't survive his first term, and it'll be President Palin,&quot; said Damon, who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was in town to promote ONEXONE, a Canadian children's charity expanding to the U.S., during the Toronto Film Festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's like a really bad Disney movie, &quot;The Hockey Mom.' Oh, I'm just a hockey mom from Alaska, and she's president,&quot; said Damon. &quot;She's facing down Vladimir Putin and using the folksy stuff she learned at the hockey rink. It's absurd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Damon said the public needs to know more about such things as her views on creationism and censorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Damon is currently appearing in a TV ad titled &quot;Voices,&quot; by the bipartisan, anti-poverty group ONE and its Vote '08 project. The voices of others are superimposed as the actor speaks, including Cindy McCain, wife of Republican nominee John McCain; and Michelle Obama, wife of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paris Hilton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TORONTO -- One clear fan of a new Paris Hilton documentary has a familiar name: Paris Hilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As she left the theater where &quot;Paris, Not France&quot; pre</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> miered Tuesday night at the Toronto International Film Festival, Hilton gave a few claps of applause after director Adria Petty was announced for a question-and-answer session to discuss the documentary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With close access to Hilton, Petty shot extensive footage of Hilton talking about her image, her notorious sex tape, the tabloid photographers who follow her and just the business of being herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm basically being judged, and they're creating this false person, and I can't do anything about it,&quot; Hilton says in the film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Featuring interviews with Hilton's parents, sister Nicky, publicist Elliott Mintz and such personalities as Donald Trump, &quot;Paris, Not France&quot; follows her on business meetings, a promotional trip to Japan and everyday tasks such as getting a burger at a drive-thru while dozens of photographers take shots of her ordering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's amazing that this woman is a human being and that people actually can be ruthless enough to forget that,&quot; Petty said. &quot;That's the one thing about this movie and about that experience with her is I could have just been shooting fluff, but she gave me a lot more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the Toronto premiere, Hilton posed for photos with Petty but did not talk to reporters. Outside the theater afterward, Hilton signed a few autographs before she was driven off in an SUV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petty said the idea was to create for this era a film like &quot;Madonna: Truth or Dare,&quot; the 1991 documentary that ex</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> amined the phenomenon surrounding the pop singer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hilton has &quot;created a mystery about herself that a film like this maybe wouldn't have been a great thing for her in the past,&quot; Petty said. &quot;But now, she's been so saturated in the media. We're so used to her. To see a new side of her is so exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">N one of us have ever lived through an election at a time when 80 percent of voters think the country is headed in the wrong direction. But now that we're in the thick of it, a few things are clear. From voters, the demand is: Surprise Me Most. For candidates, the lesson is: Weirdness Wins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last winter, Barack Obama succeeded by running a weird campaign. He wasn't just a normal politician aiming for office, he was going to cleanse the country of the baby-boom culture war mentality. In his soaring speeches, he denounced the mores of both the Clinton and Bush eras and made an argument for unity and hope over endless partisan warfare. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But over the course of the spring, Obama's campaign got less weird. The crucial pivot came when he failed to seize on McCain's offer to do a series of joint town-hall meetings across the country. Those meetings would have elevated the race and shown that Obama is willing to take risks in order to truly change the way things are done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, Obama's speeches became conventional, more policy-specific and more orthodox. His Denver acceptance speech was different from his Iowa speeches. It was more traditionally anti-Republican and pro-Democratic. In the speech's contrast Obama declared: &quot;It's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America. You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As David Broder noted, Obama's speech &quot;subordinated any talk of fundamental systemic change to a checklist of traditional Democratic programs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is easy to see why Obama might tack this way. Democrats have a huge advantage in a straight-up issue contest. McCain is vulnerable on health care and the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Think about how weird last week was. The Republican convention was one long protest against the way the Republicans themselves have run Washington. The vice presidential nominee came out of the blue and seems totally unlike the regular crowd of former eighth-grade class presidents who normally dominate public life. McCain's campaign ideology, exemplified in a new ad released on Monday, is not familiar conservatism. It's maverickism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it all worked. McCain got a huge post-convention bounce in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now the campaign has become a battle between two different definitions of change. The Obama camp has become the champion of policy change -- after eight years of failed Bush-McCain policies, it is time for different, Democratic ones. The McCain campaign is the champion of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> systemic change -- after two decades of bickering and self-dealing, its time to shake up the whole system in order to get things done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Obama change is more responsible and specific, but it has all the weirdness of a Brookings Institution report. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.) The McCain promise of change is comprehensive and vehement, though it's hard to know how it would actually work in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will still be hard for McCain to win in this environment, but his emphasis on broad systemic change may appeal to swing voters. Independent voters do not believe the country's problems can be solved merely by replacing Republicans with Democrats. They cast a pox on both houses. That's why they're independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, the maverick theme allows McCain to talk directly about character. Obama can hint at his values when he describes his tax cuts and health care plans, but he is indirect. Most voters, especially ones who decide late, vote on character over policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If I were advising the candidates, I'd tell them to double down on weirdness. Obama needs to occasionally criticize his own side. If he can't take on his own party hacks, he'll never reclaim the mantle of systemic change. Specifically, he needs to attack the snobs who are savaging Sarah Palin's faith and family. Many liberals claim to love working-class families, but the moment they glimpse a hunter with an uneven college record, they hop on chairs and call for disinfectant. Obama needs to attack Bill Maher for calling her a stewardess and the rest of the coastal condescenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If I were McCain, I'd make the divided government argument explicit. The Republicans are intellectually unfit to govern right now, but balancing with Democrats, they might be able to do some good. I'd have McCain tell the country that he looks forward to working with congressional Democrats, that he is confident they can achieve great things together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The candidates probably won't take this kind of advice. But remember: Weirdness wins. Surprise me most.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest attack ad in Colorado's acrimonious Senate battle shows a hippie standing next to a VW van and talking about Democrat Mark Udall's support for a Department of Peace. As the hippie opens the side door to the Volkswagen, smoke billows out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether that's pot smoke or not ... you know, it could just be an engine overheating,&quot; said Tim Pearson, a spokesman for Freedom's Watch, the deep- </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pocketed conservative group paying for the ad, which began running statewide Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is to hit Udall for his support five years ago for a proposed Cabinet-level Department of Peace, but it also riffs on opponents' attacks of Udall as a Boulder County liberal, with all the stereotypes that implies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the smoke pouring out of the van at the end, there is a suggestion that experts say could be aimed at something else: introducing into the campaign Udall's more than 3-decade-old marijuana bust that Republicans have been talking about for months but so far has gotten little traction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No candidate would ever authorize an ad like this. But with our screwy campaign finance system, you've now empowered these independent groups to be as over the top as they want to be,&quot; said Eric Sondermann, an expert in political advertising in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Udall, a five-term congressman, was arrested for misdemeanor marijuana possession in 1972, when he was in his early 20s and driving across Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A state trooper who searched Udall's car found three small bags of marijuana and a few joints. Udall spent the night in jail and paid a $300 fine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 1973 I made a mistake. I took responsibility for it then, I learned from it, and I've tried to teach my kids to be smarter than I was 35 years ago,&quot; he said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The smoke in the ad &quot;might be a way to put (Udall's arrest) into play via the blogs and others who are going to speculate about whether that's what they meant,&quot; Sondermann said. &quot;And the speculation itself can be as effective as the charge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now it's a well-worn strategy of the modern campaign - the art of (not so subtle) suggestion that provides plausible deniability but gets the point across.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did Barack Obama really mean to refer to Sarah Palin when, of all the expressions he could have used to ding McCain's policy turns, he said, &quot;You can put lipstick on a pig&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain camp says yes. Obama on Monday called it mere coincidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Republican Bob Schaffer's campaign constantly refers to Udall as a Boulder liberal, they say they're simply making a geographical designation. But it's also clearly aimed at evoking stereotypes of the crazy left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of Udall's pot bust, Republicans have been talking about it to reporters at least since January, but they have also been careful not to bring up the issue publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walt Klein, a senior adviser to the Schaffer campaign, responded to the marijuana bust in the Colorado Springs Independent in January, saying, &quot;I don't think that's any kind of an issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But independent groups have been aggressive players so far in the state's Senate race - a key congressional battleground. Freedom's Watch, the ad's sponsor, has close ties to former Bush administration officials and is chaired by Mel Sembler, a major Bush fundraiser, according to Federal Election Commission records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sondermann said that he thinks the ad will make people chuckle, but it may be so over the top that it won't impact many votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For people already disinclined to vote for Udall, it will give them added fodder for why they aren't in Udall's camp. Voters vote in the present and future tense much more so than in the past tense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain got a boost of voter support following his party's nominating convention, pulling even with or ahead of Democrat Barack Obama in seven national polls taken over the weekend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, a senator from Arizona, has an average lead of just under 3 percentage points in the polls taken since the Republican National Convention concluded Sept. 4 in St. Paul, Minnesota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Arizona senator's post-convention bump erased an average lead of just under 7 points that Illinois Senator Obama had after the Democratic National Convention in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Denver during the last week of August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain and his running mate, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, campaigned together today in Missouri. Obama is holding events in Michigan and Ohio, while his vice presidential nominee, Delaware Senator Joe Biden, was in Wisconsin. All four are swing states where both campaigns are competing intensely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a USA Today/Gallup survey, McCain led Obama 50-46 among registered voters. Among those the survey deemed likely to vote in the November election, McCain's lead was 10 percentage points, 54-44, a 13-point swing since before the Republican convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a separate Gallup Inc. daily tracking poll of registered voters taken Sept. 5-7, McCain was ahead by 5 percentage points, 49-44. Obama had led in that survey by as much as 8 points after the Democratic convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the ABC/Washington Post survey of 961 registered voters, Obama led McCain by one point, 47-46, within the poll's 3 point margin of error. Among likely voters McCain leads 49 percent to 47 percent. The survey found a swing of support to McCain among white women. In August, that group backed Obama 50 percent to 42 percent. In the latest poll, white women supported McCain over Obama 53 percent to 41 percent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">EDITORIAL You fooled us once, BLM ... After the Roan Plateau debacle, why should Westerners be open to recklessly leasing millions of acres for oil shale development?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Memo to: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From: The people of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subject: Fool us once ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Aug. 14 you disregarded pleas from Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter to phase in leasing on 55,186 acres of the Roan Plateau believed to hold 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Ritter argued a phased-in plan would provide better protection for wildlife and ultimately a higher return for state and federal taxpayers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the superior wisdom of the federal bureaucracy, you ignored the carefully crafted proposal by the people who actually live here and leased all the land in one fell swoop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, your swoop fell. And fell hard. We had been promised by industry boosters like Americans for American Energy that Colorado's share of the leasing bonuses would be about $1 billion. But because BLM glutted the market with a mass leasing, we received just $56 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next time, it might be best to listen to the locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then last week you unveiled another bright idea: a plan to open nearly 2 million acres of public land in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah to commercial oil shale development. In one fell swoop again, as fast as possible, before the pro-development Bush administration gives way to either Barack Obama or John McCain, both of whom have promised to be more sensitive to the environment and less beholden to the oil industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, the resource is even bigger than the Roan and contains 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil. And the BLM says we need to lease it all now, posthaste, flooding the market again in return for more chump change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the thing: Coloradans have been promised an oil shale boom since the early 1900s. It hasn't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">happened. There are thousands of acres already under lease, far more than enough for current research. And most experts predict commercial production is at least a decade away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, commercial production would raise serious issues about the West's most precious resource - our water - that must be addressed first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We agree with Ritter, who said: &quot;Finalizing an environmental impact statement without any clear understanding of the environmental, community, economic and energy impacts of commercial-scale oil shale development is irresponsible, short-sighted and premature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frankly, having been burned on the Roan, Westerners don't really expect the BLM to listen to reason on oil shale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Congress will listen, and we urge lawmakers to keep the existing moratorium on oil shale leases intact until state and local officials have a chance to weigh the tremendous issues at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That way, as The Who once said, We don't get fooled again!</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wouldn't have floor seats this time. But that's not the only thing that changed when my former boss, Sen. Joe Lieberman, addressed the nominating convention of a major political party last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was at a different party entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While some of his Democratic colleagues have expressed anger at this switch, my vantage is a little different. I keep remembering another time when he took a convention stage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For 10 years, I had the privilege of serving as Lieberman's chief of staff, until I left his office in 2003. I've been running through some of the senator's greatest hits during that decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'm remembering that hot day in August 2000 when a small group of Lieberman staffers joined a cheering crowd of thousands in Nashville to watch Vice President Gore and Sen. Lieberman appear together for the first time as a ticket. Rather than recycle the usual political attacks and rhetoric, my boss used his speech that day to talk about his faith and give thanks for the opportunity to serve his country. He expressed his gratitude toward Al Gore for making history by choosing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After a whirlwind week, we found ourselves at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Sitting in the Staples Center that Wednesday night, I was surrounded by a sea of signs reading only, &quot;Hadassah.&quot; The look on the senator's wife's face and the emotion in the auditorium that night brought me to tears. Imagine: the daughter of Holocaust survivors addressing the entire world. &quot;Only in America,&quot; as Joe Lieberman often says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because the senator was addressing Republicans last week, I've been thinking about another time he squared off against a Republican: his vice presidential debate with Dick Cheney. Conventional wisdom now sees that debate as somehow a victory for Cheney, but no one much other than Cheney staffers expressed that view that night. Rather than engage in pointless and ad hominem attacks on each other or their respective presidential candidates, the two candidates had done what most Americans hope their leaders will do when they sit down to debate -- they'd conducted themselves like adults and had a respectful, wide-ranging conversation about the challenges facing our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We lost that election, of course, but after the final Supreme Court decision in December, Lieberman was one of the most popular elected officials in the United States. He couldn't walk through an airport without being mobbed. Once, autograph seekers surrounded him at the San Francisco airport; just a few feet away, football star Joe Montana passed by alone, unrecognized by the throng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since that trip, I've left Capitol Hill, and Lieberman has run two difficult campaigns. His 2004 presidential bid didn't get far. And in 2006, under the unrelenting attacks of left-wing bloggers and a liberal, novice opponent with essentially unlimited personal money to spend attacking him, the Democratic voters of Connecticut narrowly denied the senator renomination to the Senate from the state that he had served essentially his entire adult life. This blow to such a decent man and capable senator was deeply disappointing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the Internet has had many positive effects on the political process -- most notably this election season, when Sen. Barack Obama has used it to raise millions of dollars from small donors -- the anger and vitriol that too often characterize the politics of the online community have had much to do with the decline in civil political rhetoric. Because elected officials feel compelled to cater to one side, and its online echo chamber, they all too often say only what their online world wants to hear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's a difficult thing to do when you're Joe Lieberman, a man who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't fit into anyone's neat categories. As a result, in recent weeks, he has found himself attacked by both the liberal blog DailyKos and the conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh. Not only is this brand of politics shrill, it's also ineffective. As is almost always the case, the bloggers' candidate lost the general election in 2006, and Lieberman was reelected by a substantial majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Which brings us to this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The senator who just eight years ago had played a critical role in helping Al Gore close a double-digit gap in the polls, in a campaign that won the popular vote, spoke at the Republican convention on behalf of John McCain. This same senator who couldn't walk though an airport without being mobbed by Democratic supporters is now less popular in my party than a former Democratic senator who had a high-profile affair. When a reporter asked Democratic convention-goers who would be less welcome in Denver, Joe Lieberman or John Edwards, the unanimous conclusion was my former boss. The notion that his transgressions were somehow more egregious than Edwards's speaks volumes about today's political culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The people who are angrier at Lieberman see his sins as policy- and party-related. They're outraged that he's working so hard for the candidate of the opposing political party. In a deeply divided, red-vs.-blue town such as today's Washington, his transformation is tough to take. It isn't seen as a sign of a postpartisan, cooperative future that's good for everyone. It's seen as a betrayal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let's remember, though, that the Joe Lieberman who spoke at the GOP convention is doing what he has always done in public office -- following the path he believes is in the best interests of the United States, regardless of the political cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andresen served as Sen. Joe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lieberman's chief of staff from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1993 to 2003.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">796 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C an the super-rich former governor of Massachusetts -- the son of a Fortune 500 CEO who made a vast fortune in the leveraged-buyout business -- really keep a straight face while denouncing &quot;Eastern elites&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can the former mayor of New York City, a man who, as USA Today put it, &quot;marched in gay pride parades, dressed up in drag and lived temporarily with a gay couple and their Shih Tzu&quot; -- that was between his second and third marriages -- really get away with saying that Barack Obama doesn't think small towns are sufficiently &quot;cosmopolitan&quot;? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Can the vice presidential candidate of a party that has controlled the White House, Congress or both for 26 of the past 28 years, a party that, Borg-like, assimilated much of the D.C. lobbying industry into itself -- until Congress changed hands, high-paying lobbying jobs were reserved for loyal Republicans -- really portray herself as running against the &quot;Washington elite&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yes, they can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Tuesday, He Who Must Not Be Named -- Mitt Romney mentioned him just once, Rudy Giuliani and Sarah Palin not at all -- gave a video address to the Republican National Convention. John McCain, promised President Bush, would stand up to the &quot;angry left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's no doubt true. But don't be fooled either by McCain's long-ago reputation as a maverick or by Palin's appealing persona: the Republican Party, now more than ever, is firmly in the hands of the angry right, which has always been much bigger, much more influential and much angrier than its counterpart on the other side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What's the source of all that anger?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of it, of course, is driven by cultural and religious conflict: Fundamentalist Christians are sincerely dismayed by Roe vs. Wade and evolution in the curriculum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What struck me as I watched the convention speeches, however, is how much of the anger on the right is based not on the claim that Democrats have done bad things, but on the perception -- generally based on no evidence whatsoever -- that Democrats look down their noses at regular people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus Giuliani asserted that Wasilla, Alaska, isn't &quot;flashy enough&quot; for Obama, who never said any such thing. And Palin asserted that Democrats &quot;look down&quot; on small-town mayors -- again, without any evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What the GOP is selling, in other words, is the pure politics of resentment; you're supposed to vote Republican to stick it to an elite that thinks it's better than you. Or to put it another way, the GOP is still the party of Nixon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the key insights in &quot;Nixonland,&quot; the new book by the historian Rick Perlstein, is that Nixon's political strategy throughout his career was inspired by his college experience, in which he got himself elected student body president by exploiting his classmates' resentment against the Franklins, the school's elite social club. There's a direct line from that student election to Spiro Agnew's attacks on the &quot;nattering nabobs of negativism&quot; as &quot;an effete corps of impudent snobs,&quot; and from there to the peculiar cult of personality that not long ago surrounded George W. Bush -- a cult that celebrated his anti-intellectualism and made much of the supposed fact that the &quot;misunderestimated&quot; C-average student had proved himself smarter than all the fancy-pants experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when Bush turned out not to be that smart after all, and his presidency crashed and burned, the angry right -- the raging rajas of resentment? -- became, if anything, even angrier. Humiliation will do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Can McCain and Palin really ride Nixonian resentment into an upset election victory in what should be an overwhelmingly Democratic year? The answer is a definite maybe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By selecting Barack Obama as their nominee, the Democrats may have given Republicans an opening: the very qualities that inspire many fervent Obama supporters -- the candidate's high-flown eloquence, his coolness factor -- have also laid him open to a Nixonian backlash. Unlike many observers, I wasn't surprised at the effectiveness of the McCain &quot;celebrity&quot; ad. It didn't make much sense intellectually, but it skillfully exploited the resentment some voters feel toward Obama's star quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That said, the experience of the years since 2000 -- the memory of what happened to working Americans when faux-populist Republicans controlled the government -- is still fairly fresh in voters' minds. Furthermore, while Democrats' supposed contempt for ordinary people is mainly a figment of Republican imagination, the GOP really is the Gramm Old Party -- it really does believe that the economy is just fine, and the fact that most Americans disagree just shows that we're a nation of whiners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Democrats can't afford to be complacent. Resentment, no matter how contrived, is a powerful force, and it's one that Republicans are very, very good at exploiting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC's Chuck Todd found the speech &quot;as non-ideological as a Republican could give,&quot; noting there were very few barbs at Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News' Brit Hume called the changing photo backdrop &quot;alarming.&quot; His Fox colleague Karl Rove noted there were 67 paragraphs in the speech, 19 devoted to kitchen-table issues, 11 biographical, eight about foreign policy, six about reform, six about Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vamping before the speech on MSNBC, Chris Matthews observed that &quot;the Iraq war remains the leitmotif of this campaign. The world sees Obama as a war critic, McCain a war veteran.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Greenfield on CBS took McCain's repetition of the word &quot;fight&quot; to mean &quot;I'm not too old.&quot; He found much of the speech &quot;surprisingly familiar.&quot; His colleague Bob Schieffer reacted more positively, saying, &quot;the Republicans are more unified than I thought they would be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC's Chuck Todd found the speech &quot;as non-ideological as a Republican could give,&quot; noting there were very few barbs at Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News' Brit Hume called the changing photo backdrop &quot;alarming.&quot; His Fox colleague Karl Rove noted there were 67 paragraphs in the speech, 19 devoted to kitchen-table issues, 11 biographical, eight about foreign policy, six about reform, six about Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vamping before the speech on MSNBC, Chris Matthews observed that &quot;the Iraq war remains the leitmotif of this campaign. The world sees Obama as a war critic, McCain a war veteran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pitching the storyline forward to television's next big political ratings-grabbers, Matthews said, &quot;I do think we'll see this come to the fore in the debates.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to cancel pick up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was quite disappointed upon reading that the Boulder City Council has determined that the city-sponsored collection of leaves and branches is be considered for elimination due to budget constraints. I assumed with the current trend in the economy that the city is being hit with additional expenses and reduced revenues, thus the need to eliminate a popular and effective service provided by the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently the Camera reported a laundry list of items that the city is considering for funding at this time -- none of which related to the city-sponsored organics pick up. I was willing to give up the city's collection of leaves and branches if the money was needed for critical service such as police, fire, etc., however this does not seem to be the case. The City Council seems to have acted without any community input to eliminate a service that helps to reduce the amount of organics headed to the dump. Please consider leaving the organics pickup in the budget. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice presidential</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> qualifications</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T hanks very much to Mr. David Cook (Open Forum, Sept. 3) for enumerating the many presidential qualifications of Sarah Palin in his letter to the Daily Camera. I did not know that Governor Palin was so skilled at gutting moose, or that she enjoys eating said moose, and I will be glad to vote for a candidate with such a strong anti-moose platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Who can forget that it was the moose who supplied Osama bin Laden and the Taliban with weapons, training and political support. Then the dastardly moose ignored the consensus of the U.S. intelligence community and negligently allowed the 911 attacks to occur. On top of it, the greedy moose continue to have billions of dollars of war business in conjunction with the bin Laden family. Oh, wait a minute, that was all the Bush family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OK, what about those polar bears? Governor Palin has taken the clear stand that the evil polar bears are responsible for driving up gas prices by obstructing construction of benevolent oil wells. In fact, I recall that these same liberal &quot;polar&quot; bears supplied Saddam Hussein with weapons, training and political support, only to launch an unsupported war against him which killed untold thousands of people and drove gas prices to stratospheric levels, and then had the audacity to make huge profits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the war, the reconstruction and the rise in oil prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What's that you say? That was Rumsfeld, Cheney and the Bushes? Let's overlook that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well, Governor Palin is a strong fiscal conservative who opposed the infamous &quot;bridge to nowhere&quot; project in her crusade against pork barrel spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Didn't she lead the fight in support of that project? Only to change her tune when supporting it became political suicide? Must have been a different Governor Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ignore all of the above nonsense, it's just standard liberal blather. It doesn't matter because Governor Palin's family is a shining example of traditional conservative values and the evils of birth control and sex education. She would never stand for the travesty of a 17-year-old unmarried pregnant daughter, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOSH SHURTLEFF</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muckraking a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> turnoff to voters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I t should come as a surprise to exactly no one that the democrats are capitalizing on the personal travails of John McCain's vice presidential pick. The announced pregnancy of Governor Palin's 17-year-old daughter must have felt like a gift from God to the Democratic spin doctors and muckrakers whose sole purpose is to vilify and discredit anyone who stands in the way of their man's path to the White House. These &quot;defame by any means necessary&quot; tactics have become a virtual science in the world of American politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately they rarely, if ever, have any relevance on the ability of the candidates to govern and lead. Given the current culture I have no doubt that Obama's declaration that family life is &quot;off limits&quot; will do little to deter the payrolled bloodhounds from sniffing this garbage out and doling it to the public drip by drip. And don't get me wrong, I realize that McCain's aides are just as zealous in their pursuit of dirt on members of the Obama camp. I mean surely someone is working diligently to find a YouTube clip of Barack saying &quot;hi&quot; to Farrakhan in an airport that someone else can turn into a lifelong friendship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why is it so impossible for these people to realize that the main reason most Americans have become so disenchanted with the politics of this country is because these races end up sounding more like a tawdry episode of Melrose Place than an issue-oriented discourse on the future of our country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apparently there is no such thing as a guilt-ridden night's sleep as long as you're sleeping in the Lincoln bedroom. Here's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to another presidential election where less than 40 percent of the eligible voters decide the fate of the nation for the next four years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Enviros, meet oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> W hen an oilman and the Sierra Club agree you know that change is actually happening! Texas oil billionaire T. Boone Pickens and Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope met in Denver last week and talked about the Pickens Plan, which calls for huge increases in investment and production of wind power and using American natural gas as a transition fuel source. Now I'm not in support of more natural gas drilling on our Western Slope, but I am for getting the United States off of imported oil and onto renewable energy sources like wind and solar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a recent ad publicizing the plan, Pickens says the current debate over drilling &quot;misses the point&quot; and I am in complete agreement. The current political emphasis on whether or not to open up more of the coastline to drilling is a distraction. Pickens, who's made billions from oil, believes the Bush administration is wildly exaggerating how much oil can be found offshore and in Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Americans need to take notice -- clearly the big oil companies trying to wring every drop out of oil profits before the inevitable, yet the real economic opportunity lies not with the failed ideas of the past but with real investment in the transition to a clean energy economy. T. Boone Pickens and Carl Pope realize this, and now it is up to all of us to follow that path.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. PAUL, MINN. - Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin on Wednesday cast herself as a Washington outsider and typical &quot;hockey mom&quot; whose small-town roots and state political experience qualify her to be the country's next vice president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embracing the mantle of reform, the Republican vice presidential pick introduced herself to the American public, saying she &quot;took on the old politics as usual in Juneau when I stood up to the special interests, the lobbyists, big oil companies and the good-old-boys network.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And backed by numerous standing ovations and roaring cheers, she fired back at critics who have questioned her political bona fides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not a member of the permanent political establishment. And I've learned quickly, these past few days, that if you're not a member in good standing of the Washington elite, then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone,&quot; she said in the most anticipated speech of Republican National Convention week. &quot;But here's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion - I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it was her first national address - not to mention the most important speech of her career - Palin showed she was ready to take on the conventional vice presidential role of pit bull.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before I became governor of the great state of Alaska, I was mayor of my hometown,&quot; said Palin, 44, the state's first female governor and who has been in office 21 months. &quot;And since our opponents in this presidential election seem to look down on that experience, let me explain to them what the job involves. I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a community organizer, except that you have actual responsibilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The barely veiled barb, which received huge applause, was directed at Democratic nominee Barack Obama, who started his public-service career as a community organizer in Chicago. Throughout her speech, Palin criticized Obama for his lack of experience, noting that his rhetoric often makes people &quot;forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform - not even in the state Senate.&quot; And she painted him as a liberal weak on national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Victory in Iraq is finally in sight; he wants to forfeit,&quot; she said. &quot;Al-Qaeda terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America; he's worried that someone won't read them their rights. Government is too big; he wants to grow it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin was joined by her husband, Todd, a commercial fisherman, her parents and five children in the audience. Signs through the convention hall declared &quot;Palin Power&quot; and &quot;Hockey Moms 4 Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hunter, former beauty queen and PTA member who is opposed to abortion rights in all circumstances except when the mother's life is at stake, Palin was immediately embraced by social conservatives when she was added to the John McCain ticket last week. Palin also injected a much-needed energy boost into McCain's campaign, which at times has struggled to turn out enthusiastic supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conservatives have remained squarely on her side, even as disclosures about her professional and personal life have caused waves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin only generally addressed the issues. &quot;Our family has the same ups and downs as any other, the same challenges and the same joys,&quot; she said, as some delegates nodded their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's 17-year-old, unmarried daughter is pregnant, and the governor has had to hire an attorney to represent her in an investigation into the firing of Alaska's public-safety commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though she has touted herself as a reformer with a record for cutting wasteful government spending, Palin hired a lobbyist when she was mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, who snagged $26 million in federal earmarks, according to the independent watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. And although she has since condemned federal funding for Alaska's infamous &quot;bridge to nowhere,&quot; she initially supported it. That would appear to put her at odds with McCain, who opposes pork-barrel spending and called the project &quot;outrageous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin and McCain also differ on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: Palin supports it while McCain does not. And Palin does not believe global warming is caused by humans, while McCain believes humans have contributed to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Palin, who chaired the state's regulatory Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in 2003 and 2004, picked up McCain's call for energy reform, saying their administration would &quot;lay more pipelines, build more nuclear plants, create jobs with clean coal, and move forward on solar, wind, geothermal and other alternative sources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also mocked comments Obama has made about offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our opponents say, again and again, that drilling will not solve all of America's energy problems - as if we all didn't know that already,&quot; she said. &quot;But the fact that drilling won't solve every problem is no excuse to do nothing at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin, nicknamed &quot;Sarah Barracuda&quot; in high school because of her competitive nature, touted her experience defying the status quo: selling the governor's private plane on eBay, vetoing &quot;half a billion in wasteful spending&quot; and suspending the state gas tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The series of controversies surrounding Palin prompted questions about McCain's vetting process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pit bulls don't wear lipstick,&quot; she joked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of her speech, McCain came on stage to thunderous applause and asked the delegates, &quot;Don't you think we made the right choice for the next president of the United States?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hunter, former beauty queen and PTA member who is opposed to abortion rights in all circumstances except when the mother's life is at stake, Palin was immediately embraced by social conservatives when she was added to the McCain ticket last week.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">P ITTSBURGH -- The guilty pleasure I miss most when I'm out slogging on the campaign trail is the chance to sprawl on the chaise and watch a vacuously spunky and generically sassy chick flick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So imagine my delight, my absolute astonishment, when the hokey chick flick came out on the trail, a Cinderella story so preposterous it's hard to believe it's not premiering on Lifetime. Instead of going home and watching &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; with Sandra Bullock, I get to stay here and watch &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; with Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sheer heaven. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's easy to see where this movie is going. It begins, of course, with a cute, cool unknown from Alaska who has never even been on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; triumphing over a cute, cool unknowable from Hawaii who has been on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; a lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Americans, suspicious that the Obamas have benefited from affirmative action without being properly grateful, and skeptical that Michelle really likes &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show,&quot; reject the 47-year-old black contender as too uppity and untested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, they embrace 72-year-old John McCain and 44-year-old Sarah Palin, whose average age is 58, a mere two years older than the average age of the Obama-Biden ticket. Enthusiastic Republicans don't see the choice of Palin as affirmative action, despite her thin resume and gaping absence of foreign policy knowledge, because they expect Republicans to put an underqualified &quot;babe,&quot; as Rush Limbaugh calls her, on the ticket. They have a tradition of nominating fun, bantamweight cheerleaders, like the previous Miss Congeniality types Dan Quayle and W., and then letting them learn on the job. So they crash into the globe a few times while they're learning to drive, what's the big deal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama may have been president of The Harvard Law Review, but Palin graduated from the University of Idaho with a minor in poli-sci and worked briefly as a TV sports reporter. And she was tougher on the basketball court than the ethereal Obama, earning the nickname &quot;Sarah Barracuda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The legacy of Geraldine Ferraro was supposed to be that no one would ever go on a blind date with history again. But that crazy maverick and gambler McCain does it, and conservatives and evangelicals rally around him in admiration of his refreshingly cynical choice of Sarah, an evangelical Protestant and anti-abortion crusader who became a hero when she decided to have her baby, who has Down syndrome, and when she urged schools to debate creationism as well as that stuffy old evolution thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palinistas, as they are called, love Sarah's spunky, relentlessly quirky &quot;Northern</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Exposure&quot; story from being a Miss Alaska runner-up, and winning Miss Congeniality, to being mayor and hockey mom in Wasilla, a rural Alaskan town of 6,715, to being governor for two years to being the first woman ever to run on a national Republican ticket. (Why do men only pick women as running mates when they need a Hail Mary pass? It's a little insulting.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sarah is a zealot, but she's a fun zealot. She has a beehive and sexy shoes, and the day she's named she goes shopping with McCain in Ohio for a cheerleader outfit for her daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As she once told Vogue, she's learned the hard way to deal with press comments about her looks. &quot;I wish they'd stick with the issues instead of discussing my black go-go boots,&quot; she said. &quot;A reporter once asked me about it during the campaign, and I assured him I was trying to be as frumpy as I could by wearing my hair on top of my head and these schoolmarm glasses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This chick flick, naturally, features a wild stroke of fate, when the two-year governor of an oversized igloo becomes commander in chief after the president-elect chokes on a pretzel on day one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The movie ends with the former beauty queen shaking out her pinned-up hair, taking off her glasses, slipping on ruby red peep-toe platform heels that reveal a pink French-style pedicure, and facing down Vladimir Putin in an island in the Bering Strait. Putting away her breast pump, she points her rifle and informs him frostily that she has some expertise in Russia because it's close to Alaska. &quot;Back off, Commie dude,&quot; she says. &quot;I'm a much better shot than Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then she takes off in her seaplane and lands on the White House lawn, near the new ice fishing hole and hockey rink. The &quot;First Dude,&quot; as she calls the hunky Eskimo in the East Wing, waits on his snowmobile with the kids -- Track (named after high school track meets), Bristol (after Bristol Bay where they did commercial fishing), Willow (after a community in Alaska), Piper (just a cool name) and Trig (Norse for &quot;strength.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The PTA is great preparation for dealing with the KGB,&quot; President Palin murmurs to Todd, as they kiss in the final scene while she changes Trig's diaper. &quot;Now that Georgia's safe, how 'bout I cook you up some caribou hot dogs and moose stew for dinner, babe?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I would like to comment on the proposed ban of boating on the reservoir. Let's not lose sight of the benefits of boating in our own town. Having heard many stories from the old timers, this reservoir has served the community for years, from old time ski shows to current day collegiate competitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are generations of people who have spent numerous days with their families and friends on this body of water. Water skiing, wake boarding and bare footing are sports. These sports require dedication and skill just like any other sport. Thousands of people have benefited from this glorious location. As far as the negative comments on the carbon footprint implications, what about the negative effects of every boat owner traveling dozens of miles to find another ski lake? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And let's take a closer look at the thousands of cars that enter and leave the reservoir for cycling, running and swimming events every year. Is this not a concern of the city officials?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I commend Alice Diamond for an excellent letter on critical thinking and take issue with only one remark. Liberalism did not have its beginnings in &quot;modern Protestantism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Open-mindedness and a wide-ranging interest in all aspects of knowledge existed in various cultures long before Christianity was ever invented. Most notably, the Athenians of Ancient Greece exemplified this, as well as their counterparts in Egypt during the Hellenistic Age when the Library of Alexandria held levels of scholarship unmatched until the European Renaissance 1,000 years later. Thereafter, by pushing religious superstition aside in favor of the pre-Christian classics, the Scientific Revolution took flight and the philosophical genius of the Enlightenment followed. That philosophy, secular in nature and exemplified by Montesquieu and John Locke, is what led directly to the democratic principles adopted by some guys named John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, etc. An undue reverence for tradition, aka conservatism, is the last descriptor that should ever be applied to this country's founding principles. People who start revolutions are not conservative.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> W hile our minds are roiling with worry concerning energy, food and inflation there is still no shared, common sacrifice when the focus points to the condition of our army. Five years of death, disability and turmoil have taken such a toll on our troops and most notably their families, that most of us have ignored or just shuffled them in the list of our own priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While U.S. military deaths in Afghanistan climb, the deaths in Iraq have slowed but the troops still endure multiple deployments. Even when deemed non-deployable by army medical personnel. A draft during most wars has prevented such actions. Thirty-four percent of all military personnel have deployed at least twice. The reserve and national guard have been hit as hard if not harder with 63,000 troops serving multiple tours. Many active duty troops have seen four tours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To recruit fresh troops the services have increased enlistment bonuses by 37 percent, doubled the number of waivers for potential recruits with identified criminal records, documented poor health and a history of drug or alcohol abuse. They have also taken fewer high school grads -- with only 79 percent of recruits last year meeting that lofty standard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have experience</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> R ather than debate issues important to our future, Sen. John McCain resorts to the diversionary tactics of the GOP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and attacks Sen. Barack Obama for his abilities as an orator and for his meteoric rise from anonymity to seasoned leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain says Obama has less experience than any president in our lifetime. Given that McCain has problems remembering how many homes he owns, I had some doubts about that claim. If the lifetime being referred to is McCain's, then we're looking at a span of eight decades. How could it be that Obama's 11 years as an elected official would be less than any president in McCain's lifetime?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain's&nbsp;ad is simply wrong. We've had 12 presidents since 1936. Six had more years of experience as federal or state leaders and six had the same or fewer years than Obama. And if you do the math for all presidents, only 19 had more years than Obama while 23 had the same or less experience (http://is.gd/20F9).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let's move past the attacks from the Greedy Old Politicians party and focus on the issues. Are we concerned about our children's futures? Education in the 21st century? The environment? Health care? Jobs? Foreign diplomacy? If so, then it's time to clean house in D.C. of the Republican loyalist appointees who have been &quot;doing a heckuva job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We need a president who will bring change, hope, and intelligence to the Oval Office. Our president needs to be able to personally relate to the complex world we live in today and must have experience working with the issues we face in our communities. The candidate who has the experience that counts and the character to unite and lead America into the future is Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historic, unforgettable - and that was just the text-messaging. Really, the DNC finale was the awesome spectacle and mixed-media miracle planners hoped it would be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emotional power of the night was obvious but difficult to convey. Media coverage of the big-hearted, tear-inducing rally couldn't do it justice. Tamped down by audio controls and staid anchors, it was large on the tube but tough to translate. Television struggled for perspective, struggled to capture the fervor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you were flying over this in an airplane, you would never believe this is a political rally,&quot; CNN's Anderson Cooper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media notes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's camp played it both ways on TV: He's decided on a running mate but won't spill because &quot;it's Barack Obama's night.&quot; The speculation continues. So did discussion of the congratulatory McCain&nbsp;commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All day on the chat channels, it was nasty back and forth. Fox News had hours of fun Thursday knocking the Greek temple architectural style of the Invesco stadium set, &quot;fit for an emperor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Gergen on CNN said, &quot;There is a place for talking about all this ephemera,&quot; but he wanted a discussion of &quot;the most serious financial crisis since the depression ... global warming, high costs, a more competitive world.&quot; Enough about the silly set. He cautioned on a night of unbridled joy: &quot;Race remains an issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the rally began, Bill O'Reilly didn't stop his &quot;Factor&quot; for the festivities, nor did PBS interrupt the &quot;NewsHour.&quot; They missed a forceful address by Al Gore, blasting the GOP's fear of change. &quot;Same old policies?&quot; Gore said, &quot;I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visually, CNN's skycam was fine but didn't seem a particular advantage. Too often, though, the choice was extreme close-up or extreme wide shot. It was tough to feel present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Eisenhower and the generals symbolically bestowed high Republican blessings. But the Abe Lincoln metaphors? Just asking for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox, meanwhile, worried about the weather. Would President Bush's speech be washed out Monday by Hurricane Gustav? Would split-screen coverage of the convention in St. Paul and devastation in the gulf send the wrong message? So many agendas, so little time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And finally, it's the biggest night in the history of Denver, and Channel 9 is showing preseason football. KUSA news director Patti Dennis said they'd join the Invesco Field DNC coverage at 8 p.m., but also offered a video stream online. (When the Windsor tornado hit in May, which affected a fraction of the people waving flags at Invesco, KUSA did umpteen hours of continuous coverage.)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year ago, John McCain was attacking Rudy Giuliani's foreign-policy credentials as both battled for the Republican presidential nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Wednesday, it was Giuliani doing the attacking, blasting Democrat Barack Obama as unprepared to handle foreign affairs and praising McCain, his one-time rival, as an experienced leader. The former New York City mayor's visit to Denver came as the McCain campaign released a TV ad criticizing Obama for remarks he made about Iran and calling him &quot;dangerously unprepared.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's just not ready to lead,&quot; Giuliani said of Obama. &quot;I think Barack Obama has continuously, throughout this campaign, displayed his lack of knowledge and his lack of experience about foreign policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani's visit kept with the Republicans' &quot;Not Ready '08&quot; theme for this week. Like other McCain surrogates who have visited Denver, Giuliani pointed out that Democrats Hillary Rodham Clinton and Joe Biden have said Obama is not experienced enough to handle foreign affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TV ad released Wednesday, shown during the news conference at which Giuliani spoke, alludes to a quote from Obama in which he referred to Iran as a &quot;tiny&quot; country that &quot;doesn't pose a serious threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad continues, &quot;Terrorism, destroying Israel, those aren't 'serious threats'?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama - dangerously unprepared to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani said it was &quot;naive&quot; to &quot;describe (Iran) as a tiny country that doesn't pose any threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the quote to which Republicans are referring is taken out of context. Obama described Iran, Cuba and Venezuela as &quot;tiny&quot; countries compared with the former Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They don't pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us,&quot; Obama said in May. &quot;And yet we were willing to talk to the Soviet Union at the time when they were saying, 'We're going to wipe you off the planet.&quot;'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when asked about a gaffe McCain made about Iran in March, Giuliani bristled. McCain, in two separate instances, repeatedly said the Iranians, who are predominantly Shiite, were training al-Qaeda operatives in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Qaeda is a Sunni group unlikely to get Iranian help, a fact that McCain acknowledged after it was whispered in his ear by Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democrats' vice-presidential nominee in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani said candidates during a campaign sometimes get details mixed up when speaking. He pointed out, for example, that Obama, while speaking via satellite Monday night, said he was in St. Louis when he was really in Kansas City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``When Sen. McCain does it, it becomes a major issue in the press,'' Giuliani said. ``When Sen. Obama does it, it gets buried.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DNC's politics, problems and police presence Sunday evening while walking along the 16th Street Mall on our way to our DNC volunteering, I was ashamed of Denver and our country. There were hordes of police literally everywhere. They were on foot, on bikes, on horseback, marching in formation, etc. They had on riot gear they were carrying submachine guns and all kinds of weapons and armor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could have been in Russia or North Korea. I doubt if there is that much &quot;security&quot; in Iraq. What are our city, state and national leaders thinking?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our volunteer training, we were taught to present Denver as a friendly, welcoming city. But our &quot;leaders&quot; have undone anything that I could do.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Pat Schroeder makes some very important and valid points about the extreme sexism Hillary Clinton has faced in this presidential Democratic primary season, she ignores that Barack Obama has faced significant racism. Also, her recent flagrant fawning over the multimillionaire Jared Polis, including making a one-person TV ad for him, supporting him over the far more qualified and experienced Joan Fitz-Gerald, makes her op-ed ring hollow and hypocritical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever since I was a young girl in Denver, I idolized Pat Schroeder. Until now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;3 held in 'credible threat' on Obama,&quot; Aug. 26 news story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest of three people, who may be white supremacists and who were apparently planning to assassinate Barack Obama at the Democratic National Convention, shows that even though our nation has made great strides in racial relations and harmony, there are still dangerous racist and extremist elements out there. It is sad that people have to be so hateful and prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read a recent poll indicating 27 percent of Hillary Clinton supporters plan to vote for John McCain. Talk about shortsightedness! I think this election is not about Iraq or the economy, it is about the Supreme Court and our freedoms. McCain is a decent man, but he has already caved to the religious right and promised to nominate conservative justices like John Roberts and Clarence Thomas. The Supreme Court is on the edge of being too far right, and the next couple justices will be crucial for decades to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are a Clinton supporter, stop whining, take a deep breath and get on board with Obama. Your personal freedoms are at stake.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read the opinion pages every day. I am interested in reading letters to the editor by people who share my opinion and by people whose opinions differ from mine. But what is most disturbing to me lately about the letters I read regarding the political campaign is the pessimistic views of people who find it appropriate to criticize Barack Obama's optimistic messages: change, hope, a better future, the American dream, teamwork, to name a few. What does it say about our society when these ideas are thought to be negative? We all know what happens when you have no goals or dreams to work towards - you achieve nothing. Is that really the type of president you want? Someone with no vision? Just look back on the past eight years and you can easily answer that question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellen Haverl, Denver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me get this straight. The Republican Party is now trying to claim that Barack Obama is not ready to lead, even though the current occupant of the White House had no foreign relations experience at the time, and his only real legitimate claim to fame was serving as the governor or Texas. Oh, I almost forgot, he was also part owner of a baseball team. If that leadership experience was good enough for the Republicans eight years ago, I would certainly think that Sen. Obama's experience and leadership abilities far surpass any of those credentials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Move forward on roadless plan,&quot; Aug. 20 editorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Denver Post had it right when it used a television game show to describe the Bush administration's efforts to rewrite the Forest Service rule that governs Colorado's roadless national forests. Unfortunately, it's the popular 1950s contest &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; that more accurately describes reality, as the White House uses its final months to do what it hasn't been able to do for the past eight years - open up Colorado's best backcountry to industrial development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post relied heavily on the ability of one Forest Service manager to craft a good policy for the state. He and many of his colleagues are well-intended, but the product that's been delivered is seriously flawed and loosely written.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado's national forests are a timeless treasure - unless, of course, they get beaten by the clock.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a long, slow build to the emotional high point of Night One of the Democratic convention. The commercial TV networks likely rejoiced in their decision to dip in for only one hour of prime time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">En route to the Sen. Edward Kennedy climax, which turned out to be the penultimate climax, PBS kicked back for a lengthy interview with former President Jimmy Carter; the 24-hour cable networks cut away to visit with delegates and officials on the floor; pundits stroked their metaphoric beards and everyone (excepting CSPAN, of course) looked away from the podium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The excitement that has been evident on Denver's streets was absent from the television screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're two hours into this, and the Democrats offer very little of substance for television purposes,&quot; David Gergen told CNN. &quot;You need to build people's attention early on and not let these hours get frittered away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The frittering continued, giving lots of nonmagnetic personalities and civilians too much exposure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I haven't seen a picture of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. When will I see them together?&quot; Chris Matthews demanded. He was probing the story of the day, the question of party unity, which ABC's Charlie Gibson had referred to as &quot;disunity&quot; in his evening newscast. Even Matthews' natural state of urgency couldn't make the stagnant event seem exciting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Fox News, McCain adviser Nicolle Wallace and Sean Hannity took advantage of the lull to review &quot;the audacity of the Obama campaign,&quot; in Wallace's words, and the &quot;Rezko slumlord&quot; story, per Hannity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pace picked up somewhat when Caroline Kennedy launched into the introduction of her uncle. After more frittering, finally, the Democrats found some adrenaline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the entire convention on its feet, Kennedy gave the night its spirit. He expressed what may ultimately be interpreted as a dying wish: a President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kennedy's appearance was, as Jeffrey Toobin noted on PBS, a historic American moment. Michelle Obama had a tough act to follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turns out, she was a tougher act to follow. She killed. She was everything the party hoped she would be. She nailed their American story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In TV terms, the visual effect of the set design was ultimately positive. The podium came through with flying red, white, blue and purplish colors. It's less garish on television in tight shots, less like a game show or video game when seen through a lens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dems' big show got a soft start, then found its footing. The pace can only improve from here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Squandering the nation's attention would be a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Katie Couric noted in signing off Monday's newscast, &quot;the cost of the convention? Fifty million dollars. A week of free publicity? Priceless.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those of you who believe that the Hillary Clinton Uprising is a fairy tale concocted by a press in search of convention controversy, think again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton's seductive charms lay heavy over Denver. Defiant supporters can be seen citywide, sporting Hillary pins and T-shirts in direct defiance of Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly every event in Denver includes some unruly joker who injects her name into a perfectly pleasant discussion. Why didn't Barack Obama pick Hillary as his running mate? Will her supporters defect to John McCain? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So dreaded is the thought of disunity, it has been reported, that teams will be dispatched to quell any unauthorized outbreaks of irrational exuberance from Clinton supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, Hillary loyalist and Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell missed the memo when he accused the media of an irrational exuberance for Obama during the primaries, saying, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, the coverage of Barack Obama was embarrassing. It was embarrassing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One senior Obama supporter, according to Politico, claimed Clinton associates act like &quot;Japanese soldiers in the South Pacific still fighting after the war is over.&quot; And as every good Democrat knows, war is never the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new USA Today/Gallup poll finds that only half of Clinton's primary supporters say they will &quot;definitely&quot; vote for Obama. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll put the number at 52 percent. More alarmingly for Obama is the 30 percent of those polled who claim they will vote for John McCain, someone else or just stay home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain camp has picked up the theme, running a television ad featuring Hillary's primary attacks against Obama. Another ad introduces us to a cheery former Hillary supporter who tells Democrats it's OK to defect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the first press releases of Monday morning alerted convention-goers to the &quot;Happy Hour for Hillary,&quot; an event hosted by the Republican National Committee where GOPers, &quot;independents&quot; and &quot;open-minded Democrats&quot; can come together to cheer on &quot;the most qualified candidate to lead our country as Commander in Chief.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One wonders if any of these distraught Happy Hour revelers could coherently point out the policy differences between the two. If not, it must be the experience. Right? The personality? Well, vice presidential nominee Joe Biden has definitely got a personality and he's been plying his trade on the Senate floor forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then again, wasn't it Obama who claimed that judgment, rather than experience, was the key to astute leadership? What, then, does Biden bring to the ticket that Clinton doesn't? Mickey Kaus of Slate posited, Biden &quot;doesn't have gravitas. He has seniority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there is a noteworthy difference between Biden and Clinton: The loquacious Biden entertained the press corps for a handful of primary debates before dropping out. Hillary convinced 18 million primary voters to support her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, then, why not Clinton? If you erode your theme of &quot;change&quot; by choosing a longtime Washington insider, why not pick the one who can unite your party?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps a clue can be found in the words of Nancy Pelosi, who said Democrats need to &quot;begin anew.&quot; At a convention that features Jimmy Carter, Al Gore, John Kerry, Joe Biden and Ted Kennedy (in order of most annoying), who can argue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most observers say Biden is the &quot;safe&quot; pick. Maybe. But there is one thing for certain: Picking Biden over Clinton helps a presidential candidate. And that candidate is not here in Denver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">F irst I spent long moments trying to decide upon my greatest moral failing. Then I spent longer moments asking myself whether I'd really want to share that failing with an audience of millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much for playing along at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the time I was done agonizing, Hamlet-like, over that question, posed by Pastor Rick Warren during his televised presidential forum at Saddleback Church in Orange County, Calif., he had gone to a commercial.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Color me impressed, then, with both Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain for not stammering homina homina -- as I would have -- and promptly answering that and other toughies during last week's forum. And color me impressed with the program itself; it was that rare campaign appearance that imparted something of value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Credit the decision to ask both men identical questions; it allowed voters to draw sharp comparisons and contrasts. Credit also the questions themselves, which were designed to elicit not 10-point plans and strategic visions but, rather, some sense of how a man's mind works, some inventory of his soul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John McCain gave the more impressive performance. His answers were crisp and concise where Obama's were long and thoughtful. Where Obama navigated shifting shades of gray in answering questions about faith, gay marriage and the existence of evil, McCain's answers were as direct as an arrow in flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Take, for example, a question about when a fetus gets human rights. Obama responded that, whether one is speaking theologically or scientifically, the answer is &quot;above my pay grade.&quot; He went on say he supports Roe v. Wade &quot;not because I'm pro-abortion but because, ultimately, I don't think women make these decisions casually. I think they wrestle with these things in profound ways ...&quot; Finally, he expressed his wish to reduce the number of abortions, while not restricting access to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain said, &quot;At the moment of conception.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You found yourself wishing Dr. Frankenstein was around to combine each</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidate's best qualities into one. That expedient being unavailable, we are left to parse the ways last week's forum illuminates the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates and the parties they represent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama, for all his vaunted rhetorical agility and eloquence, seemed curiously leaden. Like legions of Democrats before him, he was unable to find a way of explaining nuanced positions in concise and compelling ways. In answering the abortion question, for instance, one could argue that he -- to use a journalism term -- buried the lede. Might he not have been more effective had he said from the beginning that his goal is to keep abortions legal -- but make them rare?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Republicans, of course, don't have the burden Democrats do; by and large, they don't do nuance. On abortion (outlaw it), immigration (build a fence) and just about every other issue you can name, they are as clear and blunt as a punch in the nose. There is a stark simplicity to their positions that is undeniably appealing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if these last years have taught us nothing else, they've taught us not to mistake stark simplicity for wisdom. That, after all, was supposed to have been the key to George W. Bush's appeal: he was a plain-spoken guy of plain-spoken values, not some egghead intellectual elitist noodling around in shades of gray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seven years later, we see where that's gotten us. The one thing most of us agree on is that the country is a mess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's something to remember as candidates struggle to explain who they are and what they believe, something these last years should have made abundantly clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The simplest answer is not always the best.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each presidential election tells a story: a sprawling American saga as big as the republic. There are ideological revolutions and moments of generational change. There are eras of lazy choices. And there are times of peril when transformative public figures seize the national stage. As the first of the year's great political conventions begins, it is impossible to say whether John McCain or Barack Obama will emerge victorious in November. Yet it is undeniable that it is the Democratic Party that now faces the harrowing challenge and sublime prize of historic opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By their own admission, the Republicans are in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trouble. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans are upset over an uncertain economy, soaring food and energy prices, an interminable war, and declining incomes. A record number of citizens, according to the polls, think the country is on the wrong track, and a record number believe the Republican president is doing a poor job. In the past nine months, the Democrats have registered millions of new voters and won three off-year congressional elections on hostile turf in the South and Midwest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats are clearly winning the enthusiasm game, certainly winning the turnout contest, winning the money game and winning the congressional recruitment game,&quot; says Karlyn Bowman, an expert on polling at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the White House and Congress to the statehouses and city halls, the 2008 campaign appears to be the Democrats' to lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 40 years, they have struggled to cope on a political landscape that has favored their opponents in a right-leaning country. Just once in the past 10 presidential elections has the Democratic candidate gotten more than 50 percent of the popular vote, and that was Jimmy Carter, who won 50.08 percent in 1976 in the wake of the Watergate scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that time, the Democrats lost their mastery of Congress, the presidency and the Supreme Court. Their Southern base joined the other side. The once-proud label - liberal - became a political epithet. Worst of all, as it struggled to cope, the party lost its brand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most Americans have no clue what Democrats stand for,&quot; wrote Al From and Bruce Reed of the Democratic Leadership Council in a postmortem review of their party's defeat in the 2004 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party no longer was seen as the defender of the little guy, but rather as a voice for elitists who undermined American families with confiscatory taxes, social engineering, loose moral discipline, over-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">regulation and timidity abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It feels like we're being judged or pounded down on because we want to carry a gun or because we want to wear the American flag pin,&quot; says Josh Williams, 24, an independent voter from Charlottesville, Va., who has been turned off by what he perceives as Democratic elitism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives increasingly referred to the United States as a &quot;center-right&quot; nation, and few historians argued with them. The last three Democratic presidencies were marred by failure, and the most recent moments of Democratic genius - Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, Woodrow Wilson's first term - have receded from memory. For anyone younger than a baby boomer, the scandal-plagued Clinton terms are all they know of a Democratic presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet in the course of those 40 years, America continued to change. The ideological choices the Democrats made in the 1960s and '70s, which then seemed like prescriptions for social disorder, now look to many like templates for American success in a global, postindustrial economy. The values prized by Democrats - tolerance, diversity, personal liberty, unfettered scientific inquiry, public education, environmental stewardship, equal rights for women, a social insurance net and a cooperative foreign policy - have been embraced by millions of Americans, especially by younger generations, as a program for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demographically, a more youthful, educated and multi-hued electorate appears poised to put its stamp on American history and seems to like what the Democrats are selling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see, on my side of the aisle, a party that is very much at variance with just about every major trend going on in America today,&quot; says David Frum, a Republican analyst and former speechwriter for President Bush. &quot;It is hard to look at these numbers without seeing flashing red warning indicators that Republicanism as we know it, as an ideology and as a party system, is in tremendous danger, if not already obsolete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2006 election offered proof. Democratic House and Senate candidates built formidable campaign treasuries and identified the party's highly motivated troops and got them to the polls. Independents and other swing voters, aghast at the course of the Iraq war and the Bush administration's fumbling response to Hurricane Katrina, voted for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the counting was done, the Democrats had picked up 30 seats in the House, six governor's mansions and six seats in the Senate. They seized control of Congress for the first time since 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Democratic coalition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who is in the Democratic coalition these days?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to television exit polls, Democratic candidates beat their Republican foes in the 2006 congressional elections by 10 points or better among women, union members, Americans younger than 30, those with postgraduate degrees, African-Americans, Latinos, voters who earn less than $100,000, liberals and moderates, political independents, gay and lesbian voters, Catholics and Jews, and secular-minded voters who don't regularly attend church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the groups the Democrats score well with - minorities, single and college-educated women, young people and professionals - are emerging as major components of the American electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are now four &quot;majority-minority&quot; states, where the combined minority population is larger than the number of white residents. The list includes two political giants, Texas and California, as well as New Mexico and Hawaii.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that five more states will join that category in the next two decades: Florida, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Maryland. Together, those nine states supply 165 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party scored well with many of these minority groups in 2006. Democrats won 89 percent of the African-American vote, 69 percent of the Latino vote and 62 percent of Asian-American voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And perhaps most significantly, the Democrats won 60 percent of the voters younger than 30 in 2006. The party has capitalized on the excitement stirred by the Hillary Rodham Clinton and Obama campaigns to register tens of thousands of additional young voters this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research shows that each generation forges its political identity in its youth and generally maintains it for a lifetime. And &quot;this has not been a good time for Republicans,&quot; said Scott Keeter, a public-opinion expert at the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press in Washington, D.C. The war in Iraq and troubles at home &quot;have hurt the Republican brand among young people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2008 presidential primaries offered a telling contrast, says Democratic Party chairman Howard Dean. The all-white, all-male Republican contenders &quot;look like the 1950s.&quot; The Democrats, with a Latino, a woman and a victorious African-American candidates, &quot;look like the rest of America,&quot; Dean says. &quot;We are the party of America's future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A revolution in progress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet &quot;the emerging Democratic majority&quot; remains a blueprint at this point. It is a revolution yet to be born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican and Democratic presidential candidates are &quot;bookends of the demographic transformation we are going to be encountering in this country,&quot; says William Frey, a professor at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research in Ann Arbor. &quot;This is what McCain and Obama reflect: the past and the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The trick is,&quot; Frey says, &quot;we are somewhere in the middle right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama will be facing McCain in November in a country in which four out of five voters still describe themselves as moderate or conservative and the two largest demographic groups are white women (40 percent) and white men (39 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2006, according to the exit polls, the typical American voter was white (79 percent), married (68 percent), Protestant (55 percent), heterosexual (97 percent) and without a postgraduate degree (72 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To millions of Americans, the attributes that recommend Obama to Democrats are negatives. Where his admirers see &quot;young&quot; and &quot;dare&quot; and &quot;hope&quot; and &quot;change,&quot; his detractors see &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;untested&quot; and &quot;risk&quot; and &quot;strange.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a Democrat, and I am thinking more about McCain, just because I don't trust Osama, I mean Obama - it's only one-letter difference. His middle name is Hussein,&quot; says Charles Fasano, 56, of York, Pa., who voted for John Kerry in 2004 and for Clinton in the state's primary this spring. &quot;My feeling is he has done nothing to show America he is worthy of being the president. He has just recently come out to say, 'I am proud to be an American.' His wife is down on America. He is down on America. ... You know, he comes from a Muslim family. (Obama is a Christian, but his father and stepfather were raised in the Muslim faith.) I just don't - it's not right. I can't see it. I fear for America if he comes in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of all America's presidents, only one took the White House with less relevant experience than Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Abraham Lincoln.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The archetypical face of America's future may be a group of 20- and 30-somethings, of varying ethnicity, gender and marital status, checking their BlackBerrys in Austin, Texas, or Palo Alto, Calif., or using their Apple laptops to build profiles on Facebook or to check out YouTube via Wi-Fi in Seattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Clinton demonstrated in New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania, there is still a strong, more traditional American voice in both parties. These Americans are married, go to church and don't have advanced educational degrees. They live on the edges of the suburbs, or in midsize cities and towns in rural America, where housing costs are lower and the schools are safer. They take their sons hunting, join softball leagues, mourn for Dale Earnhardt and cheer for Peyton Manning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party doesn't neglect the working class. On its behalf, and with its help, congressional Democrats fought and won two big legislative battles in Bush's second term: stopping the privatization of Social Security and raising the minimum wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Obama, many Democratic leaders have roots in working-class communities and earned, through hard work, their college degrees and fine salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Democratic economic platform is a populist classic: to cut taxes on working-class and middle-class families, raise taxes on those who make more than $200,000 a year, and spend the money on roads, schools, health care and other keys to working- and middle-class opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has never been a period when voters are more determined to have a government that works for the common person rather than, as the one we have now, that works for special interests and the big corporations and the wealthy,&quot; says Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet, Greenberg is forced to concede that it is a challenge for Democrats to carry working-class wards and precincts. In the past decade, blue-collar voters &quot;have moved over to the Republican side because Democrats worked so hard to push them away,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a party whose leading candidates, donors and tacticians hail from Ivy League campuses, the great law and lobbying firms of Washington, and ritzy ZIP codes in Manhattan and Los Angeles in recent years, elitism is a recurring problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the party of trial lawyers, labor bosses and big-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">city political machines, and of the two wings of the dependency movement - the fellows locked into welfare and the fellows that make $90,000 a year managing the dependency of others,&quot; says conservative activist Grover Norquist, an ardent libertarian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And all the various, what I would call, Coercive Utopians: the guys who get government grants to fix the rest of us,&quot; Norquist says. &quot;These are the people who make the cars too small to put entire families into and the toilets too small to completely flush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Al Gore was vice president, he seized the opportunity to &quot;reinvent government&quot; - smashing ashtrays on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; to illustrate misguided procurement practices. And in contrast to what happened in New Orleans during Katrina, the Clinton administration's Federal Emergency Management Agency performed ably during such disasters as the Oklahoma City bombing, the Northridge, Calif., earthquake and the floods that hit the Midwest in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Democrats never followed through on their reform agenda. Shaken by scandal, Clinton sought advice from his pollsters and took to championing small, symbolic issues such as school uniforms. An opening closed. Despite the Bush administration's blunders in Iraq, in New Orleans and along the Mexican border, the Democrats are still seen as the architects and defenders of a bumbling federal state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The second Clinton term will be remembered as one giant missed opportunity,&quot; party strategists William Galston and Elaine Kamarck wrote in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when the Democrats produce strategists who understand the &quot;little guy&quot; - hello, James Carville and Paul Begala - they lose them to the glitz and bucks of media sideshows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've forgotten how to speak to their hearts, as well as their heads,&quot; says Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del. &quot;We have to remind average Americans we know their problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, at least until the Dean and Obama presidential campaigns showed the staggering potential of raising money from small donors via the Internet, the Democrats grew dependent on fat-cat cash. In Congress, not surprisingly, many supported pro-business trade, liability and bankruptcy laws that conflicted with the interests of &quot;the common man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did we grow too cautious for a campaign check?&quot; John Edwards asked his audiences during this year's primary campaign. His answer was &quot;Yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's long, tough haul</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in 2006, saddled with an unpopular president, sex and corruption scandals in Congress, and stalemate in Iraq, Republican candidates whipped their Democratic rivals among white men (54 percent-44 percent), Protestants (54-44), evangelical Christians (58-41), Southerners (53-45) and Americans who attend church regularly (55-43).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the GOP candidates finished at rough parity with the Democrats among huge, vital segments of the electorate: men, white women, voters older than 65, college graduates, white Catholics, married Americans, suburbanites and parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organized and motivated, those groups vote in droves and give McCain and the Republicans a base on which to build their 2008 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much was made of Obama's declaration, when addressing a group of California Democrats this spring, that &quot;bitter&quot; working-class Americans &quot;cling&quot; to God and guns and &quot;antipathy&quot; to foreigners and immigrants. It was an illustrative example of the liberal condescension that haunts his party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, earlier in those same remarks, Obama gave a sober appraisal of the long, tough haul he faces selling hope and &quot;change you can believe in&quot; this fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a lot of these communities in big, industrial states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, people have been beaten down so long (and) they feel so betrayed by government that when they hear a pitch that is premised on not being cynical about government, then a part of them just doesn't buy it,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And ... it's true that when it's delivered by a 46-year- old black man named Barack Obama, then that adds another layer of skepticism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was no accident, then, that after being rejected by the white working-class voters of Ohio and Pennsylvania this spring, Obama's campaign papered Kentucky with a pamphlet that proclaimed his Christian convictions and portrayed him at a pulpit, before a glowing cross. It told the story of the time when the candidate &quot;felt a beckoning of the spirit and accepted Jesus Christ into his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or that one of his first general-election campaign commercials was directed at voters in Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia, Alaska, Montana, Ohio, Nevada, Florida and other Bush states, hailing &quot;the dignity that comes from work&quot; and boasting of the time, as an Illinois legislator, when Obama &quot;passed a law to move people from welfare to work&quot; and &quot;slashed the rolls by 80 percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said From and Reed: &quot;A party that has averaged 44.5 percent of the vote in the last 10 presidential elections and has only won a majority of the popular vote for president twice in six decades needs to start winning over some of the voters it is losing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking ahead, the Democrats face an Electoral College that has a constitutional bias toward less populated states that traditionally lean Republican and in which Gore and Kerry failed, by one-state losses (Florida in 2000 and Ohio in 2004), to assemble the needed 270 votes for victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats made huge progress in the Electoral College under Bill Clinton. He shattered the Republican lock and captured California, which has since rested comfortably in the Democratic column. But they have been hurt by the Bush family's success in two other Sun Belt giants - Texas and Florida - that have sizable minority populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the primaries ended, most Washington analysts proclaimed that the lists of secure and battleground states seemed relatively stable. Indeed, 34 of the 50 states have voted for the same party in the past four presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of all the potential Republican candidates, McCain may give the Democrats the toughest time in the Electoral College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's independence has always played well in New Hampshire, for instance, and he should be able to hold his native Arizona. His regional roots and attitudes may frustrate the Democratic Party's Western strategy and its hopes of winning New Mexico, Nevada or Colorado. And his record as a Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war could boost his votes among veterans and help secure Virginia and the Carolinas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is a surprise shake-up in the Electoral College, it may well take place below the Mason-Dixon Line, where the descendents of slaves could play a crucial role in determining the fate of the first African-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's maverick ways and secular attitudes could temper the enthusiasm of Southern evangelical voters, for whom the Democrats will make a determined pitch this year. In Southern states such as Virginia, Georgia and North Carolina, a sizable African-American constituency might join with women, transplanted Northerners and high-tech professionals to make things interesting. Even if Obama can't win those states, he could force Republicans to spend time and money in districts and precincts they have long taken for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats' dream candidate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This kind of political slicing and dicing is, of course, what Obama is avowedly not about. He burst upon the national political scene at the 2004 Democratic convention with a thrilling speech and the memorable line, &quot;There is no red America. There is no blue America. There is only the United States of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the postpartisan, pragmatic Obama emerges as the Democratic candidate, given the lousy climate for Republicans, he could be tough to beat. Obama speaks eloquently of such traditional American cultural values as family, hard work, faith and responsibility. He embodies the American dream: a half-black child raised by a white single mom, whose smarts, hard work and drive took him to Columbia University, Harvard Law School, the U.S. Senate and the Democratic nomination. With audacity and hope, he has gotten closer to the presidency than anyone, ever, who is not a white male.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Tiger Woods or Oprah Winfrey, Obama has the ability to &quot;transcend race,&quot; says Norm Ornstein, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. &quot;He's not out there running a campaign like Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton. This is a campaign that says, 'Let's overcome the whole notion of race.&quot;'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, though famously divided over its two historic candidacies - after 34 million ballots were cast, Clinton and Obama finished the primary season just 200,000 votes apart - the Democratic Party knows what it believes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, working with a Democratic Congress, says he will start withdrawing troops from Iraq, repeal the Bush tax cuts for upper-income Americans, adopt a less belligerent foreign policy, invest in alternative energy sources, address global warming, and make health care more accessible and affordable. He would also, if given the opportunity, try to stop the conservative drift of the U.S. Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voters might be ready for that agenda. The security and values issues the Republicans have used to defeat Democratic challengers in past elections may be paling in the face of economic distress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm registered Republican ... and I considered myself Republican up until this point. Now I'm like, 'I don't know what I am,' &quot; says Janell Mader, 32, a homemaker with a 4-year-old daughter from York, Pa. &quot;I live a very comfortable life ... but I see a lot of other families who are deeply affected by the economy, and it is difficult for me to know good, honest, hard-working, intelligent college-educated people who are losing their job and unable to afford the basic necessities for their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that for most of my life, my decisions have been made based on morals and family values and, like, that whole belief system that I've had instilled in me since birth,&quot; Mader said. &quot;And now all of a sudden our country is just, like, turned upside down with all these economic issues that we, I, haven't encountered in my lifetime. And it is really making me second-guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is another Obama, just as there was another Michael Dukakis in 1988, another Al Gore in 2000 and another John Kerry in 2004. The Republicans are proven masters at defining the Democratic presidential nominee in unfavorable terms, and Obama's relative inexperience, dark skin and liberal beliefs will give them ample material with which to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Americans elect a black man president?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's original sin is slavery. And for more than two centuries, the issue of race has consumed our economy, our politics, our law and literature, and our sports and entertainment. Now America will likely have its first man of color nominated for president by a major political party. And he is running on a platform that says race is irrelevant, that it is time to put this history behind us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Democratic Party, it is a special moment, one for which it deserves special credit. When Lyndon Johnson signed the great civil-rights legislation of the 1960s, he told his aide Bill Moyers that the Democrats had &quot;delivered the South to the Republican Party for a long time.&quot; Knowing the political cost, Johnson and the Democrats paid it anyway. Will 2008 be the year when &quot;the long time&quot; comes to an end? In a new, multiracial America, will the Democrats be rewarded for the courage they showed when doing the right thing on civil rights?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1944, the American and British military commanders, convinced that all the indicators favored their success, launched a daring strike through Holland to cross the Rhine River, outflank the Nazi defenses and bring a quick end to the war. The plan failed, as one officer said famously, because its final, and most important, goal was &quot;a bridge too far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the indicators of political demography favor the Democrats. What is not so clear, the experts say, is just when the future arrives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In choosing Barack Obama as its nominee, will the Democratic Party transform America?

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama moved further toward the middle in his selection of Joe Biden by picking a longtime senator meant to prop up the relative newcomer on experience, experts said Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Obama) has been running on forging a new kind of politics,&quot; said Robert Eisinger, a political scientist at Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland, Ore. &quot;By putting someone seasoned on the ticket, the message will be amended. It's now change with experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, a Delaware senator since 1972, chairs the Foreign Relations Committee and is considered one of the top Washington insiders on international affairs. Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, is serving his first term in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the two men, so different in their campaign styles, might not mesh, Eisinger warned. If the Obama campaign, which expects tight discipline and keeps to script, tries to rein in the freewheeling Biden, it risks losing some of the magic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he plays the disciplined Joe Biden, that's not Joe Biden at his best,&quot; Eisinger said, calling Biden's acceptance speech &quot;uninspiring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the idea that a Biden pick blunted Obama's promise to deliver change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden has been a fighter for change,&quot; Pelosi said. &quot;He has resisted the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans want to have it both ways. They want to advertise that John McCain is the candidate of experience, and now they're saying experience in Washington, D.C., is not a good thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Sen. Ken Salazar said Biden would bring &quot;tremendous energy&quot; to the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is by far one of the best experts on foreign policy in the entire United States Senate and the entire country,&quot; Salazar said. &quot;We need to put the world back together again, and Joe Biden is that person to complement Barack Obama's experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor John Hickenlooper said the Delaware Democrat has been a leader in dealing with urban issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has consistently shown you don't throw money at problems,&quot; Hickenlooper said of Biden. &quot;You come up with solutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign for John McCain expects to launch a new television ad today meant to fan flames of discontent among supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources inside the McCain campaign, the ad, called &quot;Passed Over,&quot; will air in Colorado and other battleground states. Using clips of Clinton during the primary race, the ad suggests that Barack Obama didn't pick Clinton as his running mate because she criticized his lack of experience and his association with convicted land developer Tony Rezko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``She won millions of votes but isn't on the ticket,'' the ad says. ``Why? For speaking the truth on his plans. ... The truth hurt, and Obama didn't like it.'' Chuck Plunkett, The Denver Post</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans hoping to capture the state's open Senate seat were dealt a setback Friday by national party leaders, who announced that their fundraising efforts were falling far behind expectations and immediately scaled back the money they plan to spend in Colorado. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news could shift the dynamic of the state's Senate race, one in which both national parties were expected to spend heavily to support the prospects of their candidates, Republican Bob Schaffer and Democrat Mark Udall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the national GOP's independent expenditure committee canceled about a quarter of the ad buys it had already booked in Colorado for this fall, according to public records, reducing the total from $4.8 million to $3.6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Senate committee reported $25 million in the bank for July, compared with $42 million for the Democrats. But the Republicans also have more Senate seats to defend and more incumbents in closely contested races. Democrats have booked $4.2 million worth of TV time in Colorado between September and Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bad news for Republicans was delivered by Nevada U.S. Sen. John Ensign - who heads the party's national Senate election effort - in an unusually frank statement issued Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I recently challenged my colleagues to step up to the plate and help me provide the resources our candidates need to compete in races across the country. ... It has become clear that my call has gone largely unanswered,&quot; Ensign said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went on to say he had no choice but to cut the money the national party could spend on individual Senate campaigns such as the one in Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensign's letter is in part a game of chicken, hoping to pry some of that money loose, Republicans say, but it is also an admission of just how poor a fundraising year 2008 has been for his party, affecting races on just about every level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, presumed Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama raised $51 million, compared with Republican John McCain's $27 million. And in Colorado, Udall had about $1 million more in the bank than Schaffer at the end of the last reporting period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential elections</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ads play to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama's strengths</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I can't resist responding to the John McCain&nbsp;commercials that recognize Barack Obama as a world celebrity but call into question his &quot;readiness&quot; to lead. While many political ads are notoriously slanted, this particular one plays into the hands of Obama's strengths. He is indeed seen worldwide as a celebrity. Leaders, people and countries around the world have recognized him as a leader and hailed him as their hope for the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have the honor to work with governmental and political leaders around the world in democratization assistance. In that capacity I have worked with them in over 30 countries. I think Americans would be surprised to see how much these leaders know and understand about our country and our political processes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They follow closely what is happening in the United States and are constantly asking about the election and who will be the winner in the presidential contest. After viewing American actions for the past seven and a half years, they still look to America to be a strong leader, not one who is dictatorial and advocates preventive strikes and unilateral imperial overreach, but rather an America who engages in productive dialogue and respect for the art of negotiation first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They look for a leader who will provide them hope that a change in current policies will occur. They look to see that once again traditional American values will be promoted where everyone can envision opportunities, not just the privileged few, and that countries can look to America for assistance, and at least, a modicum of respect for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So contrary to what Mr. McCain attempts to portray, the person he sees as being recognized as a leader and a celebrity is already here. He is on stage, and the rest of the world is anxiously awaiting his election and a change in the failed policies that Mr. McCain continues to support. Perhaps Mr. McCain would be better served not to recognize Mr. Obama's strengths and the world's recognition of those.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Approval ratings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the dump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T he magic numbers are nine and 14. Actually, it's 9 percent and 14 percent. These are the numbers of Americans who approve of the U. S. Congress in a recent Rasmussen poll and Gallup poll respectively. That means that a large percentage of Americans disapprove of the way that the U. S. Congress is conducting our business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are much lower than the approval rating of the president, which is around 30 percent. This raises some interesting questions for those who are paying attention to what is happening in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If these numbers are so low, why are political pundits and analysts predicting that the Democrats will increase their number in both houses this Fall? Won't that mean that the ratings will go lower?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, would they increase at all if the other party wins a majority? Recent history shows that the numbers, 9 percent and 14 percent, would probably not go up very much, if at all. But maybe it wouldn't decrease any more. This is just some food for thought for citizens who can still think for themselves and have not been brainwashed by politicians and the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nancy Pelosi recently said that George Bush is a complete failure as president. Isn't that the &quot;pot calling the skillet black?&quot; This session of Congress is the most inept one in the history of America! All Americans should be concerned about the future of our great country with these two parties in control.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I found the fact that the Boulder City Council voted to eliminate the Spring Cleanup a travesty. Why are they doing it? They are saving the $300,000 cost for something of a higher priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is the higher priority? It will &quot;spend the program's $300,000 budget to help businesses reduce how much they put into landfills.&quot; The city obviously feels the Spring Cleanup is a worthless program that has nothing to do with keeping Boulder beautiful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NBC coverage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is unethical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L ike most of you track and field aficionados out there, I am deeply saddened and in dismay about the lack of integrity NBC has decided to display while broadcasting the games of the 29th Olympiad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, I set my alarm for 8:25 on the morning of Aug. 16 in hopes to witness a much anticipated 100m final. Instead I was confronted with a string of cheap, paid programming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Half confused and half pissed off, I got on the Internet only to find that the race had already been run and NBC refused to broadcast it live, in hopes of better ratings if broadcasted at night. This was only the first of many disappointments. ... I had also stumbled upon numerous headlines with the bold upper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cased letters WR, obviously standing for world record, causing an uber-spoiler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I received e-mails from my parents and friends in the Netherlands wanting to talk about this amazing race, which was broadcasted live on Eurosports, and had yet to be released in the United States. The only reason they don't show it live is too build up drama and to keep you in suspense about the actual start of the race, such that you waste an entire evening, glued to their contemptible programming in hopes to catch a glimpse of a 10-second race (after several commercials and build-ups of course).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This whole incident was just a small dose of unethical journalism. In the woman's 10,000m final (broadcasted eight hours after it was live), the winner was an Ethiopian lady by the name of Tirunesh Dibaba, followed by Abeylegesse, of Turkey, then Flanagan, of the USA. As impressive as a bronze medal is, the Camera was only focused on Flanagan and didn't even show Dibaba, or her flag, or her emotions for fulfilling her hard fought ambitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Honestly ... the woman trains five hours a day, give her some spotlight. This is classic American xenophobia at its finest.</SPAN></P>

Obama wants to see if he can fill Invesco Field to accept the nomination. I'm sure it's not directly his doing, but he could have made a statement to the working folk of the state of Colorado by changing his plans after realizing that the authorities are going to close Interstate 25, thereby stifling transportation through Denver. His arrogant Invesco plans should serve as a beacon to all of us in the Centennial State as to how much he'll be taking into account the well-being of the citizenry of our country as the supreme governor of the land.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like letter-writer Janet Fine, I also find that the non-stop, excessively loud noise coming out of the numerous speakers at Coors Field detracts from the enjoyment of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Rockies' beginning, I have attended 15 to 20 games per year. About seven years ago, I experienced several innings of speaker silence at Coors Field when the sound system malfunctioned. It was wonderful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the Rockies management could shut off the speakers for a few innings each game. Or perhaps there could be some games each season where the entire game has none of the noise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every campaign begins with a message and a plan to explain that message to the voters. Jared preached change in the political realm and used his money to explain that message to the voters. Joan Fitz-Gerald ran on the status quo platform: that things are great for the Democrats in Colorado, and she can do the same things in Washington. She was able to get her message out with less money than Jared by utilizing lobbyists and political action committees, which are the traditional tools of the Colorado Democratic machinery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voters heard both messages ad nauseam and decided to vote for a change. This vote is extremely interesting due to the themes of change that permeate the upcoming presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between Jared's money, Joan's Democratic machine and Will Shafroth's newspaper endorsements, the voters were able to make an informed decision for themselves, proving that the process does indeed work, even if you personally don't like the outcome of the election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;How can Polis relate to struggling middle class?&quot; Aug. 19 letter to the editor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Letter-writer Marie Cline expresses disbelief that Jared Polis could relate to the concerns of lower- and middle-class voters because of his millionaire status. There's a simple answer to that apparent conundrum. It's called empathy. It's an emotion possessed by many higher life forms, one that allows billionaire Bill Gates to champion malaria prevention in Africa and motivates heiress Eunice Kennedy Shriver to start the Special Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think I can also safely assume that Ms. Cline will be voting for John McCain in the fall and that she has no such concerns about whether his seven houses, multimillionaire wife or lobbyist friends will impede his ability to commiserate with the common man. That's called hypocrisy, and Republicans have nearly cornered the market.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's response to criticism of his comments on the Colorado River The Colorado River Compact and water supplies in the Southwest are of great importance to me. My recent remarks may have been mistakenly construed as a call to rescind the compact and commence negotiations for new water allocations. Let me be clear that I do not advocate renegotiation of the compact. This is an approach that is forward-looking, and ensures cooperation in achieving implementation of the compact and the 2007 agreement among the states and the Department of Interior and is mindful of potential technological developments that could potentially reduce water demands in certain areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A McCain administration would mean an end to the federal command-and-control approach that has failed those of the West. As a Westerner, I fully understand that water is a precious commodity. A federally driven scheme to reopen the compact would run afoul of my longheld respect for the importance of state law and local prerogatives in the allocation of water resources. I understand the complexities of water policy, and under no circumstances would I move forward with Colorado River policies not supported by all the states involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the federal government can best assist the Colorado River Basin states by ensuring the cooperation of the Bureau of Reclamation in making water storage efficient and effective, in assisting with additional storage projects in both the upper and lower basins, and supporting states in implementing the compact. The states did a tremendous job in reaching agreement in 2007, and the federal government should simply assist them in furthering that agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the principles that inform my approach to water policy, and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify them. I look forward to our continued productive dialogues on these issues as we work to find genuine solutions to the water challenges of the West.</SPAN></P>

Surely he knew his affair would be found out, but he went ahead and played the game, putting himself out there as a dedicated family man and husband. The money was given to him while he misrepresented the product (himself) and he should refund it. Maybe they'll have to start offering politicians &quot;extra- curricular activity&quot; insurance policies so their financial supporters don't get left holding the bag when they find they've invested in a product that didn't exist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LYNCHBURG, VA. - Barack Obama's campaign Wednesday said that despite recent polls showing he and John McCain are in a statistical dead heat, the Democratic presidential candidate isn't making any changes and is sticking to his current strategy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who has launched a number of TV ads over the past few weeks portraying Obama as inexperienced, liberal and a cult of personality, has steadily narrowed the gap between himself and Obama, according to polls released this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While McCain is solidifying his base, Obama faces challenges and is shedding voters he held a month ago as he heads into next week's Democratic National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of that success may be chalked up to McCain's attacks, but also his sharper focus on supporting offshore drilling - a position he only recently adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless, the Obama campaign appears less than panicked and is going forward with what it says has worked in the past, as well as relatively new, sharp attacks on McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we ran the campaign based on polls, we would've dropped out a year ago,&quot; said spokeswoman Jen Psaki, who was traveling with the candidate. &quot;We will continue to introduce him across the country and make the tough contrasts with John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those contrasts started in earnest in the past few days when Obama returned from a Hawaii vacation. The timing is no accident, his campaign said, because as summer ends, people are starting to pay attention to the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Obama released a 30-second ad in Colorado and a number of other battleground states Wednesday that touts his plan to cut taxes for the middle class and contends John McCain's plan gives tax breaks to the oil industry and other corporations. On the campaign trail, Obama continues to tie McCain with the &quot;failed policies&quot; of President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, many political observers have noted that Obama is likely to get a bump after he announces his running mate, expected this weekend, and again after the convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he goes into crunch time with some challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surveys indicate that the public still questions Obama's patriotism and whether he has enough experience to be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Pew Research Center survey showed Obama leading McCain by 3 percentage points. Two months ago, Obama led by 8 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a Reuters/Zogby poll released Wednesday showed Obama trailing McCain by 5 percentage points - a &quot;dramatic reversal&quot; from the same survey conducted last month showing Obama up by 7 percentage points, according to John Zogby. Obama lost support across the board - from Catholics, younger voters, women and independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for McCain,&quot; Zogby said. &quot;Obama still has work to do on his base. At this point McCain seems to be doing a better job with his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is also not sitting idly by as he is attacked. He tried to portray Obama as &quot;testy&quot; Wednesday after Obama said the Arizona senator was questioning his patriotism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a new McCain radio ad slaps Obama as a tax-and-spend liberal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Celebrities like to spend their millions,&quot; the ad says. &quot;Barack Obama is no different. Only it's your money he wants to spend.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a palpable unease within the Democratic Party. After all, why hasn't Barack Obama pulled away from John McCain in the polls?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here we are with a struggling economy, an unpopular war, high gas prices, mortgage meltdown and an old coot with a wicked temper running for the Republicans. Shouldn't the urbane and unflappable Obama be ahead by at least 14 points? What is wrong with Americans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama himself has questioned the wisdom of voters, wondering at a gathering in San Francisco why, with all our tribulations, voters do not cry, &quot;Toss the bums out, we're starting from scratch, we're starting over.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If only it were so simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's often said that loathing of an opposing candidate is not enough for victory. And aversion to George Bush is not, on its own, enough reason to spur a realignment of the electorate. This election, in fact, despite the fruitless attempts of Obama, is a traditional battle between the left and the right. It's about policy and, the worst distraction of all, politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, Obama seemed unwilling to participate in this repugnant world. On the other side, the more aggressively political McCain has become, the more Republicans seem to believe they can actually win this thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidates, of course, should not take elections too personally. Any two generic nominees are likely to split the nation somewhere in half. Our fundamental attitudes about the world do not change simply because we're stuck with an incompetent president, a bad spot in the economy or a spiffy ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At some point, though, we need to hear where candidates stand on policy. This is where Obama struggles. Politics is about divisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first sign of trouble was energy. As soon as gas prices approached $4 a gallon, Republicans, sensing real anger, demanded more domestic energy production. Democrats found themselves in a dangerous spot; as sentinels of Earth's well-being, they were unwilling to cede that more drilling should even be part of a solution, calling it a &quot;gimmick&quot; and &quot;hoax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, now nearly every Democrat, including Obama, supports this &quot;hoax.&quot; It's the sort of convenient policy shift that reminds us of ... well, of every politician who has ever walked the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such political calculations have been the trademark of Obama. On public finance for his campaign, immigration policy, international trade and retroactive immunity for phone companies, it's been about political expediency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama recently told evangelical preacher Rick Warren that the most difficult decision he's ever made was his opposition to the Iraq (while in the Illinois legislature). Yet, even with his defining issue, Obama has modified his position as polls dictate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when we throw the bums out for the sake of change, what will we be changing to? What kind of policies would take the place of the ones wrought by those bums?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics as usual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans, not long ago, rightly threw Republican bums out of Congress only to have them replaced by Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, two of the most ineffective political leaders in the memory of the republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show that Congress now holds a lower approval rating (in the single digits) than the famously low approval rating of the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, let's not forget, faces an enormous uphill battle, lacking money, excitement and support. He's certainly flipped and flopped with the best of 'em.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the end, this country is divided between right and left. Higher taxes or lower. Pro-choice or pro-life. Stay in Iraq or leave. Whatever your issue, there is no &quot;we&quot; in compromise. Why should there be? It's not about candidates, it's about policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this election, despite the grandiose talk, is still about a narrowly divided nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It always has been.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video opens with a throng gathered on Washington's National Mall before flitting through a series of death-by-association comparisons: John McCain is older than the &quot;Golden Girls,&quot; the Crypt-Keeper from &quot;Tales From the Crypt,&quot; Larry King, Colonel Sanders and Yoda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just two weeks later, it's already one of modern politics' greatest hits: Paris Hilton appears, reclining by a pool in a leopard-print bathing suit and talking smack about McCain's age. She runs through an improbably coherent energy policy before closing with: &quot;I'm Paris Hilton, and I approve this message because I think it's totally hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One would be excused for wondering if this is what our political dialogue has been reduced to. But the truth is, comedy's time-honored role in politics extends deeper than an online video. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A response to a McCain&nbsp;ad comparing Barack Obama to lighter-than-air celebrities Hilton and Britney Spears, the video has snared nearly 7 million views on funnyordie.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides the fact that it's just plain funny, the number of hits points to comedy's ability to filter the sewage of the political process. The unprecedented barrage of political messages in this particular election cycle makes laughter more useful than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a satirist, I have great faith in the founders of this country who believed that power turns everybody to crap,&quot; said comedian Harry Shearer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Best known for his voice work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and roles in mockumentaries such as &quot;This Is Spinal Tap,&quot; Shearer recently released the CD &quot;Songs of the Bushmen.&quot; In keeping with his long-standing practice of political humor, it skewers the Bush administration in a series of musical &quot;tributes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shearer hopes to perform some of those songs in Denver during the Democratic National Convention next week, an event that will attract a phalanx of comedians eager to attack politics' double-speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would expect the level of theater at this one to be Shakespearean,&quot; Shearer said. &quot;And I say that having been a volunteer at the 1960 DNC in Los Angeles, where I saw Kennedy's acceptance speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;House of opportunity&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly sophisticated campaigns have muddled our ability to separate truth from propaganda, but viewing the politics through humor allows us to see it for what it is, said Wende Curtis, owner of Denver's Comedy Works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Politics in general is absolute bedlam. It's a big house of opportunity for comedians,&quot; she said. &quot;It doesn't matter which side it is, and it doesn't matter who's in office or who's got control of the House. There's always going to be these various characters out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right to mock our leaders is built into the Bill of Rights' free speech provisions, which paved the way for political newspaper cartoons to offer early Americans a satisfyingly irreverent view of corrupt figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mort Sahl, the 1950s-bred wisecracker with the V-neck sweater and newspaper tucked under his arm, has made a career of deriding - and working for - a handful of American presidents. The tradition continues today with fake news shows - Comedy Central's &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and &quot;The Colbert Report.&quot; The wildly popular programs serve as legitimate news sources for a chunk of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Comedy has always played a role in politics with late- night talk shows and things like that, but it's more and more important with the rise of stand-up on Comedy Central, and especially Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart,&quot; said Jimmy Tingle, a talk-show veteran who has appeared as a commentator on MSNBC and &quot;60 Minutes II.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Comedy is an entertaining form of commentary that augments the discussion, because with political satire you can embellish and exaggerate and get upset about things,&quot; he said. &quot;It wouldn't be right to make things up, but you at least have the ability to use your imagination and creativity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tingle will appear with fellow political comedians Scott Blakeman, Will Durst and John Marshall at &quot;Breaking Convention: A Liberal Dose of Political Humor&quot; at the Bug Theatre on Aug. 24, 26 and 27. He said the current election and convention season is uncharted territory in terms of candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of undercurrents in the country are coming to the surface,&quot; he said. &quot;Whenever there's tension it's always a good time for comedy, but the comedy itself has to be insightful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the challenge has been providing insight on relatively nontraditional politicians Obama and McCain. Some critics have charged that Obama is joke-proof, while others simply recycle stale Bob Dole jokes to mock McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's that they're staying away from the race factor with (Obama),&quot; said Comedy Works' Curtis. &quot;But it is true that he gets made fun of less. It's not just with comedians but perhaps the media in general.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shearer noted that part of it is Obama's lack of experience on the national stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His rhetorical competence hasn't been seen since Bobby Kennedy, so of course the joke files are sort of bare. But I don't think there's any more of a protective shield around him - especially if he gets elected,&quot; Shearer said. &quot;When you start making decisions, you start making mistakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most comedians and entertainers tend to lean liberal, some express cynicism at the political process in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truth-telling tradition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anything happens that actually means anything, I'll be ecstatic,&quot; said comedian Lewis Black of the upcoming conventions. &quot;It's preaching to the converted. The last one I was running around at, in Boston, I was like, 'What are they doing this for?' It's just a pep rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black, who plays the Pikes Peak Center in Colorado Springs on Thursday and the Ellie Caulkins Opera House on Friday, said that comedy's truth-telling tradition usually serves the average person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It points out that there's utterly no attempt by either party to do what they're supposed to, which is govern,&quot; he said. &quot;All they can do is tell us what the other side is saying, and how awful they are. That's not the job. The job is to listen to the other side and come up with something that works with both.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coming of the Democratic National Convention will provide a wealth of political comedy, from the bipartisan ribbing of the Capitol Steps troupe at the Arvada Center for the Performing Arts on Saturday to Bovine Metropolis Theater-hosted shows &quot;Planet Washington&quot; and &quot;On the Spot,&quot; which run Aug. 25-28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this isn't your parents' political comedy. Mark Russell-style &quot;piano-and-punch- line&quot; humor still thrives, but so does shock-value stuff like the Rolling Stone cartoon depicting McCain being tortured in a cage by exaggerated Asian stereotypes, or &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; spoofs that lampoon the media's perceived free pass for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comedy's effect on politics may be difficult to measure, but its impact is undeniable. Iconic spoofs of presidents from Gerald Ford to George W. Bush have been stock-in- trade at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for three decades, and politicians themselves have often popped up on comedy shows: Witness McCain's frequent appearances on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and &quot;SNL.&quot; (McCain's daughter Meghan briefly worked at the latter program.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having a sense of humor about yourself clearly pays off - but only if the tone is right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it's not good, it doesn't work,&quot; Lizz Winstead, co-creator of &quot;The Daily Show,&quot; told The Denver Post in April. &quot;As with anything, people go to see comedy for very different reasons, and if you're somebody who likes to see comedy to escape, then you probably won't go see a political comic anyway. But if you're somebody that pays attention to the world and likes catharsis, and laughing about irony of the world, and the way politicians work, then you'll miss it when it's not there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since this is an election season, we will hear plenty about flip-flops. If a candidate changes from a position he supports to a position he opposes, then it's a flip-flop, perhaps even a betrayal. If the candidate changes the other way, then it must represent enlightenment, an ability to learn from experience and adapt to changing circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, the Sen. John McCain who supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003 has evolved into the John McCain who said last week that &quot;in the 21st century, nations don't invade other nations.&quot; This clearly demonstrates his maturation as a statesman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You want a flip-flop? There's the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which effectively granted immunity to telecommunication companies that helped spy on Americans without a warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last fall, Sen. Barack Obama said he would support a filibuster against renewing FISA if it included an immunity provision. Then there was the Obama who last month voted for just such a bill. That was a flip-flop because he moved from a position I supported - i.e., that the Fourth Amendment means something - to one I oppose. Other people, though, might see it as a nececessary adjustment in a political system based on compromise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I liked the John McCain who could opposed torture with clear moral authority. Waterboarding &quot;is a horrible torture technique,&quot; he said, and &quot;People who have worn the uniform and had the experience know that this is a terrible and odious practice and should never be condoned in the U.S. We are a better nation than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we are not a better nation because leaders like McCain, who could make us one, don't. McCain ended up voting against a bill that would have banned waterboarding by American intelligence agencies. Clearly a flip-flop, or maybe even a betrayal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I felt much the same way about Rep. Mark Udall. Not because he just announced he'd support some offshore drilling after opposing it, but because he, like Obama, voted for the FISA bill. Udall had voted against the Patriot Act. I figured that if he had the backbone to do that, during the clamor of late 2001, then he actually cared about our rights and liberties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others might see this not as a flip-flop, but as recognition that there's a difference between representing one congressional district as opposed to an entire state in the U.S. Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for his opponent, Republican Bob Schaffer, I thought it was admirable that he promised to serve no more than three terms in the House of Representatives and that he actually kept that promise, unlike Tom Tancredo and Scott McInnis.Then again, we ended up with Marilyn Musgrave in his old seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, it's weird to see a commercial where Schaffer stands in front of windmills after he voted against incentives for alternate energy sources in 2001. Is he flip-flopping or recognizing new realities?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm glad to see that Schaffer opposes Amendment 48, the Colorado ballot initiative that would grant full constitutional protection to zygotes. But how does that opposition square with his 2000 statement that &quot;From the moment of conception, this being is alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you get right down to it, flip-flopping is our fault. We expect politicians to have steadfast principles, and we also expect them to respond to public opinion. Some do stand by their principles in the face of public opinion. We vote them out of office, and then wait about 65 years to honor them. Just ask Ralph Carr.</SPAN></P>

In fact, one of his names not only contains the letters &quot;b-a-r&quot; but actually starts with a B. He has a strong Illinois connection and is known as a good orator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The above is not only true for 2008, but also for 1908! (In 1908, Teddy Roosevelt was the second-term Republican, and William Jennings Bryan the Democratic candidate. Bryan was born and raised in Illinois and was considered a good speaker including his famous &quot;Cross of Gold&quot; speech).

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What about the fact that in 2000, at the age of 25, he helped to launch the blue wave by becoming only the second state-wide elected Democrat in Colorado after then-Attorney General Ken Salazar (now there are 4, going on 5)? Rarely mentioned, too, is the rather relevant fact that Jared was the only of the three candidates who advocates and indeed has crusaded for serious campaign finance reform and ethics laws at state and federal levels.

I can't tell you how many empty offices occupy the downtown area, the numbers are staggering. With the exit of Wal-Mart and Albertsons, downtown Lafayette has lost its largest retail anchor. In its wake, is urban blight in the form of a large empty shell of a strip mall.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why put people in need of city services out away from downtown when that is exactly where the city services are located.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">T his week we were reminded not to pick on the blonde. She might, like sleeping beauty, wake to realize she has something to say and, lookie here, she can say it to a bank of cameras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We first learned this from Princess Diana who knew she could get cameras to follow her anywhere, and she led them to the land mines of Africa, revealing the ravaged lives of innocent civilians. Her efforts resulted, after her death, in the signing of the Ottowa Treaty to ban landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on, Diana was widely seen an imbecile, but by the end with her brilliant use of publicity she spanked the House of Windsor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris Hilton may be smartening up likewise with a comic video launched this week at the expense of John McCain whose recent ad tried to insult Barack Obama by lumping him with celebrities like herself and Britney Spears. And lo, Paris the impish heiress pushed back, showing McCain as &quot;the oldest celebrity alive,&quot; replete with rotting face. Then, to everyone's amazement, she dissected energy policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many thought Paris did a fine job of discussing policy. Actually, she got the sequence backwards. Her scheme foresaw hyper-efficient vehicles coming to our rescue after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">new oil might flow from new, limited offshore drilling. In reality hybrid and electric car technologies are on the rise right now, and we can't wait for new oil to arrive as a pretext to step up our efficient technologies as well as our mass transit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we can get new oil to flow in reasonably safe ways from domestic sources -- great, bring it on -- but it better go into cars that get over 100 miles per gallon. Our use of oil from any source should be as cleverly efficient as Paris's peekaboo swimsuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stretched like linguini upon a plastic chaise lounge to discuss energy policy, Paris is living up to my long-held view of her potential. She should use her campy comedic ways as well as her platinum card contacts to speak out about energy and climate for the sake of her family's fortune which is tied up in beachfront properties around the world. A room at the Hilton would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be hard to enjoy at several hundred dollars per night when high tide is lapping around the legs of the concierge desk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Paris wants to get back in her granddaddy Barron Hilton's graces (he disinherited her last year for her juvenile antics), a fruitful path might be by inventing a joint effort between the hotel industry and the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder (note to Paris: it's also headed up by a man named Barron). For the lack of a measly half-a-million dollars per year in funding, NCAR just shut down a program that focuses on strengthening poor countries' abilities to forecast and withstand droughts and floods stemming from climate change. Yet, with 630 hotels in the spectacular settings most threatened by climate change -- from Quito and Cameroon to Algeria and Abu Dhabi -- Hilton Hotels is uniquely positioned to need climate change forecasting and help its immediate and very poor neighbors as it helps itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In lobbying for such a cause Paris could fly around the world in all manner of skimpy and glorious attire and get it photographed for Vogue. A girl can't rely just on comedy Web sites to make a difference in the world. But using any of these tools is nothing Princess Diana wouldn't do.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is in high gear for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tonight's start of the 2008 Summer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olympics. Before the torch is lit, viewers may need help sorting the advertising claims from the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opening ceremonies begin tonight at 6:30 locally on KUSA- Channel 9. After seeing two dress rehearsals, NBC this week expanded its planned coverage to 4 1/2 hours, 6:30-11 p.m., with assurances that this will be an &quot;over the top&quot; spectacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're in for the whole marathon, stay hydrated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between tonight's pomp and the closing ceremonies' circumstance on Aug. 24, expect much streaming video, cross-promotion of NBC's sister networks and Nike logos (they're a sponsor).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aiming to avoid criticism it encountered in past years about tape delays, NBC will offer some 2,900 hours live, despite the time difference from China to the U.S. The broadcaster flexed some muscle with the International Olympic Committee and ordered the most popular sports moved to morning times in Beijing, to be live for prime time in most of the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answers to a few FAQs:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Will I be able to see everything in HD?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: NBC is trumpeting the record amount of high-definition coverage for its 3,600 hours of coverage from Beijing. That's true as far as it goes. But you'll have to get CNBC HD, USA HD and Universal HD (available by subscription from Comcast and satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network) in order to see many of the sports in high-def. The Universal HD feed is a simulcast of MSNBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coverage on MSNBC, Telemundo, Oxygen, Bravo and the regular CNBC and USA networks will not be in HD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: NBC has advertised the fact that it will have specialized soccer and basketball channels covering every single game in those sports. Where can I find them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Not on Comcast, despite earlier assurances to the contrary. Try satellite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is, unless you have DirecTV or Dish services in Colorado, you're out of luck. NBC claims Comcast has reneged on a deal to carry the special sports networks. Comcast says each system is free to decide and that &quot;we try to offer something for everyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(They're not offering the Olympic Chinese or Korean language channels, either.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What about HD on NBC?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Yes, you'll see the network's coverage in HD, but you won't get the full benefit of the technology without the fiber optics provided by cable or satellite delivery and, on your end, an HD-ready television set. If you're planning to use the rabbit ears on a vintage set, don't expect it to look like much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What's the advantage to video on demand?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Digital cable subscribers can get daily highlights at no extra charge. Pregame preview clips are available now. This could be a timesaver if you have specialized interests. Computer users may find live online streaming (at work!) of 25 sports even better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Will any commercials jump out?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: This isn't the Super Bowl, when advertisers can reach a huge crowd in a condensed period. Spread over 17 days, the Olympiad is a different animal. Note, however, both presidential candidates have purchased network and cable ad time (John McCain's campaign spent $6 million, Barack Obama's spent $5 million, according to Advertising Age), so expect political pitches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What will NBC Universal consider success?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Other than piling up ad revenue, the goal is to exceed the 203 million U.S. viewers who sampled broadcasts from Athens in August 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What will make the broadcast a success?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Evenhanded commentary that avoids a xenophobic tilt; helpful yet nonintrusive graphics; adequate attention to protests and other news; and a steady flow of information about the host country that doesn't treat China as a theme park could make this the most exciting Olympics in years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W hat do Paris Hilton and Britney Spears have in common with offshore oil drilling?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three come together in an odd attack ad from Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign. The ad from the presumptive Republican nominee charges Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, of being -- wait for it -- a celebrity!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are you shocked? Did you faint dead away? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As attack ads go, this one seems notably inept -- at least at first glance. There's no doomsday voiceover, no sharks-in-the-water music, no grainy slow-motion close-up photos of scary headlines or indicted co-conspirators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, red-carpet shots of the starlets segue into majestic scenes of Obama smiling to cheering crowds. It ends with a predictably distorted description of Obama's energy policy. In brief: Obama hugs trees, McCain hugs offshore oil rigs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, as attack ads go, this one hardly leaves a mark on Obama's constantly- uplifted chin. In fact, &quot;if you shut off the sound,&quot; one somewhat bemused GOP pollster told the Los Angeles Times, &quot;almost all the images of Obama are very positive.&quot; Just as it is hard to make an antiwar movie that depicts what soldiers really go through, it is not easy to make an anti-Obama&nbsp;ad that shows Obama in front of cheering crowds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ad's value soon proved itself. By highlighting Paris and Britney, it received millions of dollars worth of free airplay and chatter on cable TV and the celebrity gossip shows and reporters. McCain's&nbsp;ad people understand TV's weakness for the spoiled celebrities that audiences love to deplore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically it was not that long ago that McCain was tagged in Republican circles as a star-seeker. He's hosted Saturday Night Live, acted on &quot;24&quot; and in &quot;The Wedding Crashers&quot; and enjoyed such favorable coverage that NBC's Chris Matthews, among others, used to call the media McCain's &quot;base.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Hollywood folks loved him, too. Hollywood names like Norman Lear, Harrison Ford, Quincy Jones, Berry Gordy and Michael Douglas have made campaign donations to the &quot;maverick&quot; McCain. Now he's belittling Paris Hilton, the daughter of Rick and Kathleen Hilton, two of McCain's campaign contributors, according to the Los Angeles Times. Great way to say thanks, Senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowadays McCain looks like a wallflower at the prom while his former adoring media runs off after the new dreamboat. Like most media-driven campaign narratives, it's overblown. Although McCain received less coverage than Obama in recent weeks, a George</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mason University study found that Obama's coverage tended to include more criticism of him than McCain's did. The media giveth and we taketh away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was expressing more concern with the media that his opponents pay to put on the air. On the day McCain's&nbsp;ad rolled out into TV markets in 11 states, Obama said in Missouri that McCain and other Republicans would try to frighten voters by talking about Obama's &quot;funny name&quot; and the fact that &quot;he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.&quot; McCain's campaign manager Rick Davis took umbrage. He accused Sen. Barack Obama of playing the &quot;race card ... from the bottom of the deck,&quot; borrowing a line that us old-timers remember from the O. J. Simpson trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Times have changed. You used to have to be engaged in actual bigotry to be accused of &quot;playing the race card.&quot; These days you can be accused of racism merely for bringing up the subject of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon a viral idea spread across the blogosphere and talk shows that, in juxtaposing Obama with the two fame queens, the ad delivered subliminally racist messages. Could this, many asked, be a more subtle version of the bimbo ad that undermined Democratic Rep. Harold Ford's senate campaign in Tennessee?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't buy it. Unlike the Ford ads, the McCain ads imply no relationship between Obama and the blondes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, if you want to argue subliminals, this ad might just as easily sway some of the &quot;Leave Britney Alone&quot; crowd to vote for Obama, if they can find their polling places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On another front, Obama had to take time to denounce a new song by the rapper Ludacris, &quot;Politics (Obama is Here).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides taking cheap vulgar shots at McCain and Hillary Clinton, the song includes a line that echoes a recent controversial New Yorker cover: &quot;We gonna paint the White House black,&quot; he raps, &quot;and I'm sure that's got 'em terrified.&quot; Most terrified is the Obama camp by Ludacris' subliminal gift to the McCain campaign, as both vie for the support of working-class white Americans who are not all big fans of rap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's show biz. It's not enough to run against your opposition. You also have to keep your suppporters on message.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public needs to support the Regional Transportation District's FasTracks program and encourage RTD and community decision-makers to find creative ways to make this promise a reality. Individuals like former Gov. Bill Owens urge RTD to back away from light rail and consider lesser solutions. What he and others ignore are the changes in development patterns that only come with a rail system. These changes are already happening. St. Anthony's Hospital is building next to the anticipated Federal Center light-rail station. Look in the real estate section each weekend and notice the ads for new projects that feature locations next to stations. No ad ever mentions being within walking distance of a bus park-n-Ride station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the changes to development, the chance for walkable communities, and the increase in choices that come for us all that is the opportunity of light rail. We must support RTD now!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---------------------------------------- Let people choose their own energy solutions Re: &quot;Ballot fight coated in oil,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 1 news analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your article does well in showing how the two major parties differ on energy policy. Republicans advocate the freedom of individual choice for consumers and producers, while Democrats advocate command-economy solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The view of individual freedom holds that consumers should be free to purchase the sources of energy that work best for us. A command economy, however, uses mandates on production to tell consumers that we are not allowed to decide for ourselves what goods and services best fit our individual needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethanol-driven price increases are the tip of the command-economy iceberg. No matter the good intentions of central market planning, government mandates on individual choice will always cause unintended problems for consumers. We should be free to choose our own energy solutions, and this can only happen if producers are free to supply them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">----------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Success&quot; of surge should not come as a surprise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are several reasons for the reduced violence in Iraq, but President Bush, John McCain, and many others have been trumpeting the success of the surge. To that I can only say: Duh!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it possible that anyone ever thought that the U.S. could send 30,000 of the finest soldiers in the world to Iraq, and that they would have no effect? Of course the surge helped to reduce the violence, but that isn't and was never the point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence has been reduced, but Iraq is little better off than it was before the surge. The government is still dysfunctional. The Sunnis and Shiites and Kurds still hate one another. The mullahs still run the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's going to happen when we seriously start reducing the number of troops? What's going to happen when we stop paying Iraqis monthly not to fight? It's clear that the Bush administration doesn't want to find out, and hyping the &quot;success&quot; of the surge is disingenuous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kurt Freund, Loveland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abandoning Iraq would be immoral and foolish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. will be in Iraq for a long, long time. The U.S. will not leave the Iraqis defenseless against their enemies. None of the Iraqi MIG and Mirage warplanes survived the 2003 war, and Iraq has no qualified pilots. The communications, radars, and missile batteries were also destroyed. The army was disbanded. Today, Iraq has only a handful of transport planes and helicopters and fewer than 20 tanks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Iraqi army is being rebuilt, and has demonstrated a big-city police force capability against the small arms available to irregular neighborhood militias. But Iraq would be no match against the powerful offensive war machines of the Sunni Syrians or the Shiite Iranians, both of whom are each eager to fill the vacuum of an American withdrawal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abandoning Iraq now would be immoral, foolish and unnecessary. Until you hear your politicians talking seriously about a multi-year plan for re-arming and re-training Iraq's offensive and defensive capability, any promise of a rapid withdrawal is fantasy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Praise to the Englewood government for standing up for human rights instead of bending to the dog crazies. Mandating cleaning up your dog's droppings in your own lawn so your neighbors don't have to smell it - let alone put up with the breeding of parasites and flies, seepage into ground water, and spreading of disease - is not just good government but common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, these same dog crazies feel they have a God-given right to let their dog defecate and urinate on their neighbors' lawns and in parks without any concern for public health. They should be required to have their dog do this mess at their homes prior to walking their dog - but this they consider too much of an inconvenience?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Primary battle for Senate District 35 heated,&quot; July 30 news story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was stunned at the unfair, unbalanced reporting of this race, portraying Alice Borodkin in an uncharacteristic scowl, using selected parsed negative responses, and diminishing her as candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Borodkin is respected as a woman of ethics and principle by colleagues and constituents and has been re-elected to the Colorado House three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has spearheaded, co-sponsored and supported legislation in critical areas like energy and environment; education and health care; women's, children's and seniors' issues; economic development; and human trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Barack Obama, she is smart; like Hillary Clinton and John McCain, she has experience and wisdom. She listens to her constituents and brings fresh ideas to the table. She knows how to get things done effectively for Colorado citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Alice Borodkin is ready to continue her work and lead - from day one!</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Y ou could be forgiven if you have the impression we have two presidents of late -- one elected, the other acting as if the November election is a mere formality. George W. Bush still holds the keys to the White House, but Barack Obama is assuming the trappings of office to a degree never before seen in American politics. And then there is John McCain, for whom even the role of underdog appears to be a challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush still has exclusive rights to &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; and Air Force One. For now at least, Obama has to settle for a campaign plane dubbed &quot;O-Force One.&quot; For a while, Obama spoke from lecterns adorned with his own faux presidential seal, which included an eagle with arrows in one talon and olive branches in the other. The seal was quickly retired after it was mocked as another example of Obama's hubris. It's not just the aura of the Obama campaign -- it's the attitude. Even Obama's once-adoring press corps has begun to complain that his campaign is increasingly characterized by secrecy, arrogance and even vindictiveness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama won't officially claim the Democratic nomination until Aug. 28, and when he does, the event will take place in a Denver football stadium that can hold up to 75,000 cheering fans. Obama apparently is too big a star for an ordinary convention hall. According to the Atlantic magazine, he already has directed his staff to begin planning for the transition to the White House. And on his trip to the Middle East and Europe, he told reporters he wanted to acquaint himself with foreign leaders &quot;who I expect to be dealing with over the next eight to 10 years.&quot; Presidents, of course, are limited to two four-year terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama has long been his party's presumptive nominee,&quot; wrote Dana Milbank of The Washington Post last week. &quot;Now he's becoming its presumptuous nominee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milbank went on: &quot;Fresh from his presidential-style world tour, during which foreign leaders and American generals lined up to show him affection, Obama settled down to some presidential-style business in Washington yesterday (July 29). He ordered up a teleconference with the (current president's) Treasury secretary, granted an audience to the Pakistani prime minister and had his staff arrange for the chairman of the Federal Reserve to give him a briefing. Then, he went up to Capitol Hill to be adored by House Democrats in a presidential-style pep rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Along the way, he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual president's. Traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long, presidential-style motorcade, while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities. ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a witness Milbank did not name, Obama told House Democrats, &quot;This is the moment ... the world has been waiting for,&quot; adding: &quot;I have become a symbol of the possibility of America returning to our best traditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe a Bible verse is in order here. The Book of Proverbs warns us: &quot;Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much Obama can the country take before succumbing to charisma fatigue? His president-in-waiting demeanor could turn off some undecided voters. According to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll, the election could be less a contest between Obama and McCain than a referendum on Obama. Many voters are still struggling to reach a comfort level with him, which may explain why McCain remains within striking distance of Obama in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, McCain has cast himself as the underdog even as he struggles to come across as presidential. Like a real president, McCain has started delivering a weekly radio address. Earlier this year, the presumptive GOP nominee traveled to the Middle East, and more recently to Latin America. However, his trips were largely ignored by the news media, including the three television network anchors who tagged along with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing presidential is the least of McCain's problems; he needs to show that he is more competent than his snake-bit campaign suggests. Are voters supposed to believe this guy can organize a government when he can't organize a campaign?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain can't stay on message because, as far as I can tell, he has no coherent message. He keeps flailing away at Obama, calling him an elitist one day and questioning his patriotism the next. And now the McCain campaign is running an ad comparing Obama's celebrity to that of pop stars Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. According to Politico.com, a McCain campaign memo asserted that &quot;only celebrities like Barack Obama go to the gym three times a day, demand MET-RX chocolate roasted-peanut protein bars and bottles of hard-to-find organic brew Black Forest Berry Tea and worry about the price of arugula.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now there's a message that could take off: Barack Obama is a vain health nut who is about as qualified to be commander in chief as Paris Hilton. Real presidents eat red meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it too late for John McCain to start over?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the troops?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's been so much attention paid to the political jousting between Sen. John McCain and Sen. Barack Obama over the latter's trip to the Middle East and Europe that some good news is close to being forgotten already: The Iraqi government is talking about American troops leaving by the end of 2010. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, it is not clear that troops pulled out of Iraq would come home right away regardless of which candidate wins the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, there's no official deadline for U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. And yes, for a lot of Americans even 2010 would be too long to wait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the fact that the Iraqi government wants a timetable or to use President Bush's preferred euphemism, a &quot;time horizon&quot; for the departure of American troops suggests that there might really be light at the end of the Iraqi tunnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it's weak or strong, if the Iraqi government tells the United States to leave, it must. The U.S. government has no right to stay the course if the government it helped create says go away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Austin American-Statesman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We got lucky this time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although better building codes have made this a safer region in which to ride out quakes, we are not prepared in other ways to maximize our chances for both immediate and longer-term survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When hundreds of people wrote in to The Times' Web site within minutes to share their experiences of the quake, among the stories were reports of unsecured bric-a-brac that had fallen or children who had never experienced an earthquake and had no idea what to do. And how many of us, if we ever had a home earthquake kit complete with bot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tled water, have bothered to update it in the last five years?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to ignore theoretical reports such as the one released in May by the U.S. Geological Survey and the California Geological Survey warning that a catastrophic quake, like the one that struck China, was inevitable here, and that individuals and governments were not up to the challenge. After all, we have other disasters to worry about these days. (The) quake may have provided a useful jolt of reality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">oversight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1999 Mother's Day bus crash that killed 22 mostly elderly Louisianians exposed a lax federal oversight system that allowed drivers with drug problems and debilitating illnesses to remain at the wheel of buses and tractor-trailers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the creation after that crash of a new agency to monitor truck and bus drivers and repeated promises of reform, essentially nothing has changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study reported last week by the Associated Press found that hundreds of thousands of drivers who qualify for full federal disability payments still hold commercial drivers' licenses. Hundreds of injuries and deaths are attributable to drivers who lost consciousness or collapsed while behind the wheel, according to the study by Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, a Washington-based consortium of medical, consumer and safety groups and insurers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is appalling that nine years after the senseless deaths on Interstate 610 so little has been done to make passengers and other drivers safer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is supposed to be a lousy year for Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After eight years of President Bush, the country is in a sour mood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy prices are soaring. The economy is almost as bad as we nattering nabobs of negativity in the media claim it to be. We're still mired in two wars, and let's not forget the ever-growing national debt that won't be paid off for years and years, long after the last iceberg has melted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, we're sour all right. Welcome to malaise, 21st-century style. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poll last week suggested that fewer than a quarter of all Americans think the country is moving in the right direction. Only 24 percent of Americans have a positive outlook for the country, while 76 percent say things are on the wrong track, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That 24 percent is the lowest since 1980, during our last malaise period, and it's only the third time in four decades the number has sunk that low. Think Watergate, the Iranian hostage crisis and 1992's economic downturn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When that &quot;national mood&quot; number dropped below 30 percent four previous times, during the presidencies of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush, their parties all lost the White House in the next presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet John McCain, the Republican who should be taking it on the chin, just pulled even with Barack Obama in one major national opinion poll and just edged ahead of the Boy Wonder in Colorado. The race is even tightening in pivotal Florida and Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can that be?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not like McCain is inspiring downbeat voters with visions of America &quot;as a shining city on a hill&quot; during his town hall meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something is happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pundits spent the better part of last week speculating. It could be, some suggested, that independent voters are looking at Obama in a different light now that the primaries are over and questioning whether he has the experience to serve. It could be that McCain, who still brandishes some of that old &quot;maverick&quot; image, is more palatable to moderate, independent voters than an otherwise far-right conservative heir to the Bush throne might be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could be that Americans weren't as impressed with Obama's World Tour 2008 as the media and many Europeans were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or it could just come down to our gas pains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans, for now, have the best strategy for dealing with the one thing, besides this ridiculously hot weather, that we can't stop talking about: $4 a gallon gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have tried to blame Bush's failed energy policies for high fuel prices, but it's not working. No one wants finger pointing, they want solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Republicans say drill here, drill now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It won't significantly lower gas prices any time soon, as the Democrats constantly counter, but as a political strategy it's simple and tangible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush and McCain recently flip-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flopped on their previous stance against off-shore drilling, as polls show more Americans in favor of bolstering our domestic oil supply. Even former Sen. Gary Hart last week in a Denver Post webcast said that the politics of $4 gas could conceivably convince Obama to reverse his stance on off-shore drilling. He wasn't speaking with inside information from the candidate but rather was offering a blunt political assessment: People want relief, and they see drilling as a remedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As political strategy, drill here, drill now seems to be working. Of course, it could backfire just as quickly when the off-shore drilling starts and there's still no relief at the pumps.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And finally we're off ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a myth out there, typically advanced by moralizing media types and other unsavory characters, that Americans hate negative campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know, it's corrosive to democracy, beneath our dignity and an unworthy sideshow in political discourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The myth claims you want nothing to do with this ugliness. Which is true if the attacks happen to be directed at your favored candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reality, nearly every campaign benefits from attack ads. Quite often, voters also win, learning more about the mettle of those vying for office. Luckily, the first nasty exchange between our presumptive nominees, John McCain and Barack Obama, is one such occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, whose camp once claimed that he would &quot;run a respectful campaign focused on the issues and values that are important to the American people,&quot; has canned the preening and joined the real world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when the Republican nominee ran a clumsy negative television ad this week poking fun at Obama's worldwide celebrity, contrasting him to vacuous personalities like Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, there was much to be critical about. How could McCain have sunk so low?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I mean, Paris Hilton?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, of course, is trying to feed the perception that Obama is an untested lightweight, a mere celebrity unworthy of higher office. Or, more precisely, as McCain aide Steve Schmidt asks: &quot;Do the American people want to elect the world's biggest celebrity, or do they want to elect an American hero?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, it depends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most voters want to elect someone who furthers their ideological and partisan agendas - or, quite often, someone they find personally appealing. The presidential race is by definition a popularity contest. So, one has to wonder why McCain would run an advertisement pointing out the enormous popularity of his opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, the entire brouhaha would have reflected poorly on McCain had Obama and others not responded with the tired and transparently ridiculous charge of racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times editorial board, quick to take offense for all enlightened people, claimed that McCain's&nbsp;ad was filled with &quot;sinister overtones, a ham-handed attempt to belittle Mr. Obama as a person that brings back unpleasant memories&quot; of other &quot;racist&quot; campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK. We can agree that young white women who are flushed with cash but lacking basic cerebral skills should feel slighted. But the only truly unpleasant memory this kerfuffle evokes, thanks to Obama, is the disreputable use of the race card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody thinks that Bush and McCain have a real answer to the challenges we face. So what they're going to try to do is make you scared of me,&quot; Obama explained. &quot;You know, he's not patriotic enough, he's got a funny name, you know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know this is just a prefabricated attack, because last month in Florida, Obama brandished a similar, less opaque, comment, saying, &quot;They're going to try to make you afraid. They're going to try to make you afraid of me. He's young and inexperienced and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true; Obama is black. And the person who keeps mentioning that Barack Obama is black most often is Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Obama has preemptively accused the entire McCain campaign of racism and the entire electorate of being susceptible to racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So now, those of you who find Obama's inexperience or his policy prescriptions - or even his personality - lacking, have fallen prey to bigoted politics. You are too frightened to see the light. The hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, in reality, the typical American, according to a recent Gallup poll, is far more prone to spurn an elderly candidate (or gay, atheist, Hispanic, Jew, etc.) than they are to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reject an African-American</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the appealing aspects of Obama's early run this year was that he transcended these stale tactics - even as his own party, mind you, was injecting race into the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then again, with this much power at stake, it was bound to get ugly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change? Not exactly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M emo to John McCain: You're probably kicking yourself right about now for goading Barack Obama into getting out to see the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's like throwing ol' Br'er Rabbit into a briar patch. Before you could say &quot;photo op,&quot; the junior senator from Illinois was turning Obama Nation into what looked like Obama World.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You said Obama needed to return to Iraq, where he had not been in more than two years, and find out the real truth on the ground. You must have known trouble was afoot when Obama agreed to expand that idea into a fact-finding tour of the Middle East and Europe, too, with a sizeable chunk of America's news anchors, reporters and TV cameras begging to come along. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You must have known it was a good omen for Obama and, as such, bad for you when Obama joined some of our troops on a basketball court in Kuwait -- and threw a long-distance basket from behind the three point line. Sa-wish! Ah, for the good old days, you must have thought, when Obama was awkwardly trying to bowl his way though the Pennsylvania primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next came the mother of all photo ops in Berlin, where Obama was greeted by a sea of well-wishers chanting &quot;Oh! Bah! Mah!&quot; and &quot;Yes, We Can.&quot; Inasmuch as John F. Kennedy famously said, &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner (I am a Berliner),&quot; Obama might as well have said, &quot;Ich bin ein big winner!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And where were you, Senator? While Obama spoke to hundreds of thousands in Berlin, you were doing a meet-and-greet with a few dozen in a German restaurant in Columbus, Ohio. Whose bright idea was that? Were you headed for Europe and lost your road map?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, as you told reporters at Schmidt's Restaurant und Sausage Haus, &quot;I'd love to give a speech in Germany. ... But I would much prefer to do it as president of the United States rather than as a candidate for the office of the presidency.&quot; As Fraulein Stultz, my high school German teacher, might say, you were trying to make a silk purse out of a schwein's ear. Did it work? Nein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither did the anti-Obama radio ads that the Republican National Committee placed on your behalf in three small towns that happened to be named &quot;Berlin&quot; in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and New Hampshire. Cute. But, at a time when Obama is putting foreign relations, one of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">your strongest issues, at center stage, it is an odd time to come across as Small Town John.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, when all else fails, try media-bashing. Your Web site has even posted a video montage of fawning sound bites from TV news stars and producers against a soundtrack of Frankie Valli singing &quot;Can't Take My Eyes Off You.&quot; Clever. But, like the Web previews of the anti-Obama documentary &quot;Hype,&quot; your anti-Obama&nbsp;ad has the oddly unintended effect of making Obama look good. Is it smart to brag about being less loved than your opponent is -- even by the media?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media bias charge would be bad news, if it were true, Senator. But I think your real problem is worse: You are the victim of a lackluster campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I say this, by the way, as one of your long-time defenders. I have a soft spot in my heart for all of my fellow Vietnam-era veterans. And, as history is your witness, you certainly sacrificed a heckuva lot more in that war effort than I did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But your coverage lately has been so lopsided that you're making my profession look bad. Please cut it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm waiting for you to come up with a grand, inspiring and all-encompassing theme like Ronald Reagan did with &quot;It's Morning in America&quot; or &quot;Are you better off today than you were four years ago?&quot; Elections are supposed to be about the future. Where is your Big Idea around which you can rally the nation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You don't have to be all that specific. Look at the mileage that Obama has gotten out of &quot;Change You Can Believe In&quot; without going into a lot of details. The public wants change and Obama has a theme that captures the spirit of the times. Where's yours, Senator?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, it is only mid-summer, Senator. Voters don't start paying serious attention to presidential contests until after Labor Day. Maybe you're trying to lull the Obama campaign into a false sense of security. If so, my congratulations, sir. You are doing fine job of it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After catching a TV commercial from the John McCain campaign which blamed Barack Obama for high gasoline prices, I wondered how that could be so. After all, Obama has been portrayed as a lightweight who never accomplished much, and now he's the reason we're paying $4 a gallon?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I called my favorite inside source, Ananias Ziegler, the media relations director for the Committee That Really Runs America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right off, he asked me, &quot;Can you prove that Sen. Obama was not part of Vice President Dick Cheney's secret National Energy Task Force that met in 2001?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think so,&quot; I replied. &quot;But wasn't he just a state senator in Illinois then?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doesn't matter,&quot; Ziegler said. &quot;Unless you can demonstrate that he was not involved in the Bush administration's formulation of the wonderful national energy policy we enjoy now, then it's fair to hold him responsible for high gas prices. Besides, he's a Democrat, and everyone knows they've blocked domestic oil production.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I cited numbers from the federal Energy Information Administration. &quot;Domestic crude-oil production peaked in 1970 at 3.52 billion barrels. In 2000, it was down to 2.13 billion. And last year it dropped to 1.86 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And your point is?&quot; he interrupted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it was that important to increase domestic production, why didn't it increase when there was a Republican president with a Republican House and Senate, when those evil Democrats couldn't have blocked increased drilling?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, times change,&quot; Ziegler said. &quot;Back then, even a Republican governor like Florida's Jeb Bush opposed drilling near his coastline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sort of like Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in California now?&quot; I asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish you hadn't brought him up,&quot; Ziegler snapped. &quot;Why do they worry, anyway? Don't you know that not a single drop was spilled from an offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico during hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005?&quot; &quot;That's not quite true,&quot; I pointed out. &quot;The Minerals Management Service of the Department of Interior said there were 125 spills involving a total of 16,302 barrels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ziegler pondered that and moved on. &quot;Wait until you see our next video production. It'll show a vast array of idle drilling rigs and unemployed roughnecks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But don't the oil developers have thousands of acres already leased that they haven't drilled?&quot; I asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course they do,&quot; Ziegler said. &quot;And if they can bid for more, doesn't that make for increased federal income and a lower budget deficit, even if it doesn't produce any more oil?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hadn't thought of it that way. &quot;And the new oil-shale leasing proposal from the Interior Department could work that way, too?&quot; I asked, optimistically. &quot;Studies, surveys, tests, lease sales and swaps, everything but production?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More than likely,&quot; Ziegler agreed, &quot;since nobody has found a profitable way to use the stuff. But I like the other possibility: a big chunk of your insignificant flyover state chewed into a moonscape. Every drop of water diverted from agriculture to industry. Huge new coal-fired generating plants to meet the electric demands of this industry and its workforce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I interrupted. &quot;All so people can go back to commuting 80 miles a day in 12-mpg SUVs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course,&quot; Ziegler said, &quot;just as soon as Obama and your evil, air-loving, water-protecting, wildlife-coddling elected officials get out of our way. After all, Vice President Cheney said it all: 'The American way of life is not negotiable.&quot;'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with that, Ziegler had to take another call.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Udall, Schaffer draw battle lines in first debate The U.S. Senate candidates show clear differences on several issues, including the Iraq war and energy policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Riley The Denver Post</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SECTION; Pg. A-01</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of long-distance sparring, the major-party candidates for a U.S. Senate seat shared the stage for the first time Monday in an often sharply worded debate, giving Colorado voters a clear look at their differences on energy, health care, water and the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hour-long event was dominated by the theme of energy and what - if anything - lawmakers could do to tame the spiraling cost of gasoline. The price hit $4.15 a gallon in Colorado over the weekend and is expected to go even higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Bob Schaffer accused his opponent of delaying expanded domestic drilling and the commercial leasing of oil shale with outdated, pro-environment arguments. Democrat Mark Udall, currently in the House, said what he wanted were measured steps in Colorado and greater investment nationally in renewable energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The occasional sharp tone of the debate suggested the de facto opening of a campaign that is likely to be partisan and personal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not surprised that an oil and gas executive wants to accelerate and move fast with technology that hasn't yet been proven,&quot; Udall said, referring to Schaffer's position on oil shale and the Republican's former job as a vice president of Aspect Energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schaffer in turn suggested that Udall doesn't understand basic fiscal concepts, and he missed no opportunity to ding Boulder, Udall's political home base, and its environmentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third candidate in the race for Colorado's open Senate seat, Bob Kinsey of the Green Party, wasn't invited by the event sponsor, the Southeast Business Partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the clearest distinctions between Schaffer and Udall came when they were questioned on the war in Iraq. Schaffer defended the decision to invade Iraq as both bipartisan and made with the best available information. He said, &quot;The war is not Iraq. Iraq is one battlefront in a larger war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we will be able to celebrate success&quot; when the security and economic situation allows Iraq to support a &quot;security force, a police force, a government that is able to operate in terms of a few successive elections without event, and economic might that allows Iraq to stand on its feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's not going to be next year,&quot; Schaffer said, echoing the long-haul perspective of his party's presumed presidential nominee, John McCain. &quot;It's not going to be in the next two or three years most likely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that he among a minority of lawmakers who voted against the initial war resolution, Udall said events have shown he was right to fear that invading Iraq would mean taking the eye off the ball in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My proposal - a proposal I share with many Republicans and many Democrats - is that we make a responsible and honorable exit from Iraq. No timelines; missions-based.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bring our soldiers home. Finish the job there, and reinvest here at home,&quot; Udall said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate also offered a clear distinction in overarching messages - themes that are likely to drive the campaigns over the next four months:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Udall repeatedly emphasized bipartisanship, echoing turn-the-page themes that Democrats nationally, including presumed presidential nominee Barack Obama, think will carry them well in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schaffer quoted conservative economic hero Milton Friedman and talked about the successes of the Republican revolution in the late 1990s while he was in Congress. It was a time when Americans were more confident in the economy and optimistic of the future, but also was the beginning of a more bitterly partisan political era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A well-respected debater, Schaffer often used crisp examples and pointed one-liners to draw distinctions between himself and Udall, who showed a more folksy style at the podium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican scored a significant point, for instance, when he emphasized the bipartisan belief that then-Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction by reading Udall's own alternative war resolution (albeit one that would have withheld congressional approval for war until all diplomatic measures were exhausted).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schaffer's low point with the audience seemed to be when he ticked off a long list of policies that have contributed to rising oil prices - the war in Iraq, $400 billion-plus annual deficits, a $9.4 trillion national debt, and a weak-dollar monetary policy - and then blamed them all on Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These have all taken place since the Democrats have taken the majority in Congress&quot; 18 months ago, Schaffer said. (The war in Iraq began in 2003, and deficits have been rising steadily since then.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Udall's best moment might have been when, as he emphasized his work on the House Armed Service Committee, he asked people to show their appreciation for America's troops, which brought even Schaffer's supporters to their feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sherry Ellebracht, who said she went into the hall unsure about whom to support and came out the same way, said both men were a little rough in their presentations and that she didn't see a winner in the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``This was the first one out of the gate,'' she said. ``They are both going to get smoother and perfect their responses. This is just the beginning.'' ------------------------- What they said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the war on terrorism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schaffer: &quot;These individuals have been attacking and attacking and attacking the United States going back to the fall of the Shah of Iran in the late 1970s. ... It is just a different combination of anti-American, anti-freedom terrorists whose vision is a totalitarian religious dominance of the entire planet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Udall: &quot;The threat of extremism is real. We have to be tough, and we have to be smart. And we have to use all of our weapons, including our military but also including our Bill of Rights and our economic system. ... That's how we are going to prevail, and we will prevail. I have no doubt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On health care</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schaffer: &quot;As a goal, we ought to insist on universal access to health care for every single American. ... We need to provide incentives directly - whether it's through tax credits, whether it's through tax-free accounts that you own and that you keep yourself and pass on to the next generations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Udall: &quot;I'm not for a government-sponsored solution. I'm for enhancing and improving the system we have. ... We have to expand the children's health insurance program. ... We can create insurance pools for small business, and we can put in place tax credits for those families who are struggling to meet those premiums, and we ought to make sure insurance companies can't discriminate against us or family members who have pre-existing conditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Pi&ntilde;on Canyon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schaffer: The Army &quot;has not made the proper plan; it has not made the proper analysis. ... I don't support expansion of the Pi&ntilde;on Canyon area by the United States Army.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Udall: &quot;I've been opposed to the use of eminent domain to expand Pi&ntilde;on Canyon. The Army hasn't made a justifiable case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Washington</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schaffer: &quot;I worked my way through college on a farm. We had an old phrase that went like this: If you want the water to clear up, you've got to get the hogs out of the stream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Udall: ``Of the 11 previous elections, Congressman Schaffer has been on the ballot nine of those 11 elections. So to suggest that he's a stranger to public office and to serving in the public square just doesn't comport with the facts.'' (Five of Schaffer's nine tries have been for federal office.)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legendary Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens compares America's reliance on foreign oil to a drug addiction and believes the cure will come in the form of wind farms and natural-gas-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">powered vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Denver on Thursday to give a keynote speech at an oil-and-gas conference, Pickens detailed his plan to cut the country's oil imports by at least a third in 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He proposes a massive increase in the production of wind farms, building enough to supply 20 percent of the nation's electricity and replace natural gas as a primary generating source. Natural gas would instead be used as a transportation fuel, cutting demand for gasoline, a major byproduct of crude oil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lofty plan faces several obstacles, including the lack of transmission lines for new wind power and the availability of natural-gas vehicles and commercial stations to fuel them in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Pickens, worth an estimated $3 billion, has pledged $58 million to promote the plan through the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing that has not happened in this country is we have not been pressed to do anything,&quot; said Pickens, 80, in an interview with The Denver Post. &quot;The reason we haven't is there's always been cheap oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the price of oil hovering around $140 a barrel and possibly on target to hit $200 next year, he said the time has come to make a move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado's wind-farm- friendly Eastern Plains and abundance of natural-gas reserves in the Piceance Basin on the Western Slope position the state well for the so-called Pickens Plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Colorado has big wind farms in the eastern part of the state,&quot; Pickens said. &quot;Colorado has a hell of a lot of gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sporting a dark suit, gold tie and a dry sense of humor, Pickens is in the midst of a nationwide media blitz. The renowned corporate raider, who plans to build a 4,000 megawatt wind farm in Texas at a cost of up to $12 billion, said he didn't hatch the Pickens Plan for profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got enough money,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't need to make any more money - but I don't go into things to lose money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the plan could cut the amount the country spends annually on foreign oil from $700 billion to $400 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Douglas, a spokesman for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, said Pickens' plan is &quot;not impossible&quot; but has to overcome several hurdles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big challenge is manufacturing,&quot; Douglas said. &quot;We don't have the manufacturing capacity in the country to build that many wind turbines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglas said the proposal also needs transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, generally built in desolate areas, into neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Department of Energy released a report in May that said the nation could reach 20 percent wind energy by 2030. Pickens wants to reach that goal before 2020 by adding 200,000 megawatts of wind power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of 2007, the U.S. had 16,818 megawatts of wind capacity, according to the American Wind Energy Association. Colorado ranked No. 6 with 1,067 megawatts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One megawatt can power 300 homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickens' plan also faces the challenge of growing the use of natural-gas vehicles in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a direction auto manufacturers are investing a lot in,&quot; said Tim Jackson, president of the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickens' spokesman, Jay Rosser, noted that even though there are only 140,000 natural-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gas vehicles in America, 8 million exist worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickens said he hasn't discussed the proposal with presumptive presidential nominees Barack Obama and John McCain, but representatives from both camps have contacted him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---------------- T. Boone Pickens Age: 80 Estimated net worth: $3 billion Title: Founder and chairman of BP Capital Management, a $4 billion hedge fund Career: Worked at Phillips Petroleum for three years before striking out on his own in 1954. With $2,500 of borrowed money, Pickens and two investors formed Petroleum Exploration, which focused on domestic oil and gas opportunities. Later, he formed Altair Oil &amp; Gas Co. to pursue oil and gas exploration in western Canada. Both were predecessor companies to Mesa Petroleum, which went public in 1964. Mesa became one of America's largest independent oil and natural-gas companies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerned about veterans' support for John McCain, a group of Colorado labor leaders with military experience strategized Thursday on how to get union members who are veterans to vote for Barack Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting Thursday in Denver coincided with the formation of a national Union Veterans Council, which is running ads attacking McCain over his votes on veterans issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFL-CIO announced Thursday it was forming the national council to reach out to more than 2 million union veterans and others who have served in the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group launched a TV spot featuring Jim Wasser, a union electrician who is a Vietnam veteran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every vet respects John McCain's war record,&quot; Wasser says in the ad. &quot;It's his record in the Senate I have a problem with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is airing in Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado joined several states on Thursday in forming local councils of union veterans. The meeting in Denver brought officials from the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Government Employees and other unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lance Stewart, an Army veteran and a national organizer for the American Federation of Government Employees, said some Americans with military service may vote for McCain just because Obama opposed the Iraq war. He said it was important to turn the focus to McCain's voting record on programs for veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will veterans vote for John McCain?&quot; Stewart asked rhetorically. &quot;Not the educated and the active.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign responded by pointing to an analysis of the Wasser ad done by Factcheck.org, an organization sponsored by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group found AFL-CIO claims in the ad that McCain voted against increasing health care benefits for veterans to be false, noting that he voted to increase benefits for veterans, but not always by as much as Democrats proposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all started when the Video Professor e-mailed me an invitation to join his professional network on LinkedIn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, I am just a couple of e-mails away from meeting millions of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Scherer, the Video Professor, is the guy who does those commercials for computer tutorials on TV. He's the biggest TV celebrity I know personally, so I was flattered when he thought of adding me to his LinkedIn network on April 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that I am in the Video Professor's network, and he is in mine, I can safely call him a &quot;connection.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's good to have connections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why LinkedIn has grown to 23 million users since it debuted five years ago. It's also why four venture-capital firms invested $53 million in Mountain View, Calif.-based LinkedIn last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 5 percent stake these firms purchased put the Silicon Valley startup's value at $1 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, a competing Palo Alto, Calif.-based site with 80 million users, is worth $15 billion after Microsoft paid $240 million for a 1.6 percent stake last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest of them all, though, is MySpace, with 236 million members. It sold to News Corp. in 2005 for what now seems the bargain price of $580 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've been tooling around with these three social networks for several weeks, mostly just to see whether I am still cool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, though, I've attracted only six &quot;friends&quot; on MySpace, a site that seems overrun by teenagers and girls offering naked pictures of themselves in exchange for my credit-card number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, it's a good place to go when I need to meet people like &quot;Angela Death,&quot; a.k.a. Julie Adams, 26, a member of the Denver Roller Dolls roller derby team. Thanks to MySpace, I can honestly say that Death is my friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As old as I've grown, I have done better with Facebook, where I've attracted 77 friends. Gov. Bill Ritter is my Facebook friend. So is entrepreneur and congressional candidate Jared Polis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm also friends with Newt Gingrich, who is always asking me to sign some petition to drill more holes in the ground to suck up some much-needed oil. And then there's Michael Brown, who was in charge of the Federal Emergency Management Agency when Katrina wiped out New Orleans. Brown is now a big-time consultant, and recently informed his LinkedIn connections that he's been in Copenhagen and Stockholm, talking to the European Union about floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the three sites, LinkedIn has brought me the most friends. More than 300 people have joined my LinkedIn page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to LinkedIn's network statistics feature, these 300 people put me two e-mails away from meeting 36,000 people, and three e-mails away from meeting 2.5 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have already &quot;connected&quot; with some people who are even better known than the Video Professor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked Hillary Clinton to join, but I guess she was too busy losing to respond. It left me feeling snubbed because usually, people begging for votes are happy to be your friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain and Barack Obama have graciously joined my LinkedIn network at my request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people combing through my LinkedIn connections don't know that. I have actually received requests for &quot;introductions&quot; to these presidential candidates, as if I really knew them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like political candidates, I have an open-door policy on LinkedIn, Facebook and MySpace. If you ping my pages, I will be your friend whether I know you or not. Not that I need votes, but I do need readers and tipsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This policy, however, is flooding my social network pages with a lot of PR and marketing types.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of these people, whose work I've barely witnessed, have asked me to write &quot;recommendations&quot; on their social networking pages, as if somehow, my seal of approval will land them business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since starting this little experiment, I've heard from people I knew in grade school, graduate school and almost every job I've ever had. I am also connected to folks I've never met, and may not ever want to meet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these people are like songs in my iPod. Whenever I want to hear a song, I press a button. And when I get sick of that song, I can just click the button again.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A ``thank you'' from Windsor town leaders To the many businesses, organizations, government entities and private citizens who assisted the town of Windsor in its hour of need:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wish to express sincere gratitude for the immediate and ongoing services, support and contributions to Windsor during the recent tornado that struck Weld County and Windsor on May 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of our citizens, the town board and staff, we want to thank everyone. The first emergency responders helped clear the streets of trees and debris so that any necessary emergency personnel could access neighborhoods. The continued outpouring of generosity of area municipalities, the state's Department of Local Affairs, FEMA and other organizations and individuals from across Colorado helped us continue to remove debris and return services to mostly normal operations within a short period of time. The ongoing response, including national gestures of goodwill and generosity, has been phenomenal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 700 homes were directly in the path of the tornado. Over 100 of them were totally destroyed, and numerous commercial buildings were damaged or destroyed. In addition, over 300 trees were lost and three parks were significantly affected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have all been inspired by the offers of assistance, the phone calls, e-mails, cards, notes and other ways in which people have lifted us up. It would be impossible for us to acknowledge every offer of assistance, as surely there are many we are not even aware of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of the town staff, and the residents and businesses that call Windsor home, we offer a sincere thank you for your generosity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We remain steadfast in our commitment to continue to do whatever we can to assist residents and businesses in the recovery process. Companionship on this journey makes the road far less formidable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With heartfelt appreciation,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly Arnold, Town Manager, and John Vazquez, Mayor, Windsor</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A vote for the other guy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Why I won't vote Obama,&quot; June 15 letter to the editor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As much as I respect Milanne Kolquist's opinion, I simply do not understand how anyone who supported Hillary Clinton would not be willing to cast a vote for Barack Obama. If she truly believes that he &quot;lacks the ability, skill or expertise&quot; to change the direction that eight years under the Bush administration has taken this country, then she is indirectly casting a vote for John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as the supporters of Ralph Nader did in the past, making a stand based on some moral indignation toward the other candidate is a wasted vote when a tight race is expected. Do you prefer another Republican at the helm for four more years? I certainly don't!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition widespread to drilling on the Roan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Gently tapping the Roan Plateau's reserves,&quot; June 12 guest commentary by C. Stephen Allred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I agree with Mr. Allred's statement that citizens of Colorado are passionate about the Roan Plateau. In fact, tens of thousands of citizens have made their voices heard on the issue of expanded drilling in this pristine environment. Every city and town in Garfield County passed a resolution against drilling on the Roan Plateau. Of the 75,000 public comments submitted for the first Record of Decision on the Roan, an overwhelming 98 percent voiced their support for the protection of the plateau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Allred suggests that by drilling only 1 percent of the surface area at one time, that the environmental footprint - particularly at the top of the plateau - can be kept to an &quot;absolute minimum.&quot; I am not clear on what that entails. Additionally, alternative plans have favored exploration from the already disturbed base of the plateau. It has been proposed that 86 percent of gas production over the next 20 years could be extracted without drilling any wells on top of the plateau. What happened to this option?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Mr. Allred mentions that the selling out of this great natural resource will bring over $1 billion to the state and federal governments. How much of that money is designated to go to federal deficit-reduction caused by mismanagement of federal taxes and budget policies? We are selling off parts of our national heritage, bit by bit, to pay down our national debt. Where is the wisdom?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Ann Marszalek, Broomfield</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let our congressmen, Ritter know your feelings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fate of the Roan Plateau could be decided next month. Why the rush to destruction? Could it be that the BLM in Washington is also thinking of November's election? The destruction of this important wildlife and watershed area is being mandated by Washington. It is not a decision that is good for Colorado. Mark Udall is running for the Senate and he needs to hear from voters who think the protection of the Roan Plateau is important. Sen. Ken Salazar needs to hear that we want complete protection for wilderness, and Gov. Bill Ritter needs to hear that we want him to stand up for Colorado. The easiest way to contact these officials is to visit their websites and fill out a simple form. It will take a few minutes. It is something we can all do now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many presidents have an anti-environment record</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Bush's parting shots,&quot; June 15 front page story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush administration's assault on environmental protection and federal public lands has been in progress for almost eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the exception of Teddy Roosevelt and, surprisingly, Richard Nixon, presidents have not left an indelible environmental record of any historical consequence. While their ignorance or inaction has generally resulted in little environmental harm, the Bush anti-environment record (supported by many conservatives in Congress) is by far the worst in the nation's history on responsible public lands management, protection of endangered species, maintaining clean air and water, designating new wilderness areas, protection of national parks, monuments, and wildlife refuges, or curbing global warming. Drilling the Roan Plateau and rushing oil shale development are mere symptoms of a much greater disease: resource development at all costs, environmental or economic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't let UFCW fool you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Two initiatives proposed for the Nov. ballot by Local 7 are pulled,&quot; June 12 Page 1 story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't be fooled! The United Food and Commercial Workers pulled two out of the four initiatives filed, and on the surface that's good news. But with two still remaining, the UFCW is still trying to take the business community hostage in an effort to force the right-to-work measure off the November ballot. By filing measures that are extremely harmful to Colorado, UFCW is creating an unfair situation for business owners all across Colorado in hopes that the backers of the right-to-work initiative will withdraw their measure.</SPAN></P>
