<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're feeling campaign fatigue, you're not alone. It was an especially long road to Election Day 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember Tom Vilsack? The then-Democratic governor of Iowa became the first official candidate for president when he announced on Nov. 30, 2006, in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. (His bid ended in February.) That began the march to Iowa, where Sen. Barack Obama and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee won their party's respective caucuses, followed by Sens. John MCain and Hillary Clinton winning the New Hampshire primaries in January. It took Sen. McCain until March to finish off his challengers, while the Obama-Hillary slugfest didn't end until June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now decision day is here. Once again, Ohio is among the crucial states that both presidential candidates have fought hard to win. But there's also a long ballot that includes five statewide issues; a contest for attorney general; elections involving all of Ohio's members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Ohio House, and lots of races for county officeholders. Finally, there are levies that are important to schools, for instance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As polls have increasingly shown Sen. Obama with the lead, the McCain campaign hasn't given up, but Republicans nationally have started emphasizing the dangers of having one party controlling both the presidency and Congress. The Republicans' message is not absurd or unfounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumably, most people will want to pick the president they want, then worry about balance when they get to lower offices, if at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big question, if Sen. Obama is elected, is whether the Democrats might also gain a filibuster-proof 60 seats in the Senate. That would probably be dangerous even for the Democrats. If they let power go to their heads, they could easily get their comeuppance in 2010. However, Ohio doesn't have a Senate seat in play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the dangers of partisan voting are always present. The big year the Ohio Democrats had in 2006 - as a result of scandal - resulted in some excellent officeholders, including Gov. Ted Strickland and Treasurer Richard Cordray (now running for attorney general). But it also resulted in Marc Dann as attorney general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The further you go down the ballot, the less the races are about party and political philosophy, and the more they should come down to who is simply the better candidate - who has the better mind, more experience, or most common sense. There are some well-meaning, dedicated people running in what, for them as well, feels like a marathon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of them don't have highly paid strategists or campaign budgets that allow them to be on television (certainly not during your favorite shows or ad infinitum, anyway). They have been competing for voters' interest and attention using old-fashioned door-todoor campaigning and word-of-mouth. They deserve some discerning attention because they can affect the quality of community life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; has run up some of its best ratings in the last few weeks by featuring the politicians and lampooning them with wicked humor. Over the weekend, Sen. McCain took his turn in the barrel and got in some of his own rejoinders. When Sen. Obama was asked about his opponent's performance, he said he thought Sen. McCain's and his appearances were evidence that campaigns could be civil and that fierce campaigns didn't have to turn ugly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you're waiting in a long line, remember how remarkable the freedom to vote is. As civic duties go, this is something to enjoy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS Ohio</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama and John McCain uncorked massive get-out-the-vote operations in more than a dozen battleground states Sunday, millions of telephone calls, mailings and door-knockings in a frenzied, fitting climax to a record-shattering $1 billion campaign. Together, they'll spend about $8 per presidential vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just two days to go, most national polls show Obama ahead of McCain. State surveys suggest the Democrat's path to the requisite 270 electoral votes and perhaps far beyond is much easier to navigate than McCain's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama exuded confidence. &quot;The last couple of days, I've been just feeling good,&quot; he told 80,000 gathered to hear him and singer Bruce Springsteen in Cleveland. &quot;The crowds seem to grow and everybody's got a smile on their face. You start thinking that maybe we might be able to win an election on November 4th.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, in Columbus, Obama urged a crowd that police estimated at 60,000 to vote at a nearby polling place before it closed Sunday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do not delay because we have work to do,&quot; he said from the Ohio Statehouse steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A show of hands showed that most in the crowd already had voted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman, a Democrat, said it was the largest gathering ever for a local political event, while Gov. Ted Strickland predicted that Ohio &quot;will be in the Obama-Biden column.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Peterborough, N.H., McCain held his final town hall-style event in the state that put him on the national map in 2000 and launched his GOP primary comeback eight years later. &quot;I come to the people of New Hampshire to ask them to let me go on one more mission,&quot; said McCain, who is looking for an upset victory against Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show the six closest states are Florida, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada and Ohio. All were won by Bush and made competitive by Obama's record-shattering fundraising. The campaigns also are running aggressive ground games elsewhere, including Iowa, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Colorado and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that's left now for the candidates is make sure people vote Tuesday if they haven't already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Election Day is becoming a misnomer. About 27 million absentee and early votes were cast in 30 states as of Saturday night, more than ever. Democrats outnumbered Republicans in pre-Election Day voting in key states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That has Democrats and even some Republicans privately questioning whether McCain can overtake Obama, even if GOP loyalists turn out in droves on Tuesday. Obama may already have too big of a head start in critical states like Nevada and Iowa, which Bush won four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is off the charts in some of these states,&quot; said Michael P. McDonald, a political scientist at George Mason University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the campaign closes, voters were being inundated with a crush of television ads and automated phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new TV ad, Obama highlighted Vice President Dick Cheney's support for McCain. The ad features Cheney, an extremely unpopular figure among the general public, at an event Saturday in Wyoming, saying: &quot;I'm delighted to support John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to be outdone, the Republican National Committee rolled out battleground phone calls that include Hillary Rodham Clinton's criticism of Obama during the Democratic primary. She is heard saying: &quot;In the White House, there is no time for speeches and on-the-job training. Sen. McCain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign, and Sen. Obama will bring a speech that he gave in 2002.&quot; A Clinton spokeswoman said she disapproves of the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another phone call to Pennsylvania and Ohio voters takes Obama's words about coal-burning technology out of context and claims he will &quot;bankrupt the coal industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pennsylvania GOP also unveiled a TV ad featuring Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, declaring &quot;God damn America!&quot; in a sermon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and McCain campaigned on each other's turf Sunday. Obama was in Ohio, a bellwether state Bush won four years ago and where polls show Obama tied or winning. McCain visited Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, states won by Democrat John Kerry in 2004. He trails in both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been in a lot of campaigns. I know the momentum is there,&quot; McCain told supporters at a rally in Pennsylvania. Overall, polls show Obama winning or tied in more than a dozen or so states won by Bush while McCain trails in every Kerry state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and the RNC dramatically ramped up their spending in the campaign's final days and now are matching Obama&nbsp;ad for ad, if not exceeding him, in key battleground markets in states such as Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of planning, the Republican Party launched the last stage of its vaunted &quot;72-hour program,&quot; when volunteers descend on competitive states for the final stretch. Democrats unleashed their &quot;persuasion army&quot; of backers scouring their own backyards to encourage people to back Obama in the campaign's waning hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 10,000 Obama volunteers in Ohio were knocking on doors and planning to hit their one millionth home Sunday after a five-day push.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign reported that Saturday was its largest volunteer day, with more volunteers showing up to work the phones and walk neighborhood precincts than ever before in the campaign. Said Obama spokesman Bill Burton, &quot;Our volunteers are completely engaged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's crew says theirs are, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no doubt that we've got an uphill battle,&quot; said Rich Beeson, the RNC's political director. But, he said, &quot;I'm not going into Election Day with any trepidation that they've put any state away&quot; by banking early votes. &quot;We still have a lot of voters that we can and will turn out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC reported making 5.4 million voter contacts last week, compared with 1.9 million in the same week in 2004, and it says it's volume has steadily increased since October began. Overall, it says 26 million voters have been contacted by volunteers over four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday alone, the RNC says an estimated 3 million voters were contacted by phone or in person, and it saw so many volunteers show up to help that in at least one state, Colorado, the party ran out of canvassing packets. Some 180,000 were gone by midday Saturday; more were printed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain planned visits to media markets that hit battlegrounds Florida, Virginia, Indiana, New Mexico, and Nevada on Monday. A repeat trip to Pennsylvania also was slated before McCain returns home to Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama planned visits to Florida, North Carolina and Virginia on Monday and a quick stop in Indiana Tuesday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama told reporters he would hold a news conference on Wednesday. Later, Obama spokeswoman Linda Douglass walked back Obama's plans, saying he'll meet the press before the end of the week, but &quot;don't count on Wednesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liz Sidoti reported from Washington.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Awesome! I got to see the Beastie Boys Thursday night! (Oh yeah, they were here to campaign for Obama.) They were a hoot: &quot;Intergalactic,&quot; &quot;No Sleep Till Brooklyn,&quot; all their stuff! (They were encouraging people to vote.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheryl Crow was there! She was tight! (They passed out some fliers comparing McCain and Obama's positions on, um, issues.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Harper was excellent! He did a great duet with Crow! (Issues? You mean, like health care ... for old people? Where's the beer?) I've always wanted to see the Beasties, and this was three cool acts for just $36!!!!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All right, let's be fair. I know the Beasties, Crow and Harper, and all the other musicians such as Norah Jones and Jack Johnson, who've been playing on this season's &quot;Rock the Vote&quot; tour mean well. And I know they believe passionately that they should use the means at their disposal - talent and audience - to motivate people to do what they think is right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, really, when you're watching it unfold, it doesn't hold up - at least, not in the way the performers seem to think it does. In fact, the whole &quot;Rock the Vote&quot; cavalcade, rather than strengthening the case of any particular cause or candidate, much more seems to point out the weirdness of the way we live and think, or not, in this wacky, celebrity-fueled, junk-filled culture of ours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, sure: Popular music and American politics have always been somewhat intertwined, all the way back to &quot;Yankee Doodle,&quot; or the days when commercial composers produced sheet-music ditties endorsing Grover Cleveland. Later, when rock came along and forged its grasp on society in the fire pit of the 1960s' rough politics, it seemed like a natural soundtrack to a tumultuous time. It helped get people onto the streets, where they got results and helped bring real change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was then, and these are, for better or worse, more laid-back times. People rarely take to the streets anymore, and when they do they tend to look merely angry or quaint. Setting your political message to a rock beat, or even to a more up-to-date hip-hop thump, seems so ... 40 years ago. And even though our society applauds ignorance more than intelligence, I still don't think that many people rely on the opinions of pop musicians to form their voting choices. I think that's just as true for Toby Keith Republicans as it is about anybody who was at Hara Arena last week to see the Beastie Boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So then, how about them Beasties? Well, I've always liked them quite a lot (so whatcha-whatcha-whatcha wannnnnnnt, whatcha want?) but haven't had the chance to see them before. The Rock the Vote show was attended by mostly a white, college-age crowd that was far more there for the Beasties and Ben Harper than for Sheryl Crow. That's interesting, because Crow has sold out much more expensive double-night concerts at the Fraze in Kettering in recent years, and yet got a staid, slightly lukewarm reception from this bunch. I guess once she unfurled the Obama flag, all those south-suburban folks decided to stay home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She, Harper and the Beasties all addressed their political points in slightly oblique - emphasis on &quot;slightly&quot; - terms, discussing &quot;change&quot; and how things have gone the last eight years, hint-hint. All three acts selected songs that seemed to somehow reflect this sober point of view - which worked reasonably well for the already sober Harper, and for Crow, whose last album was straightforwardly anti-war and political. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Ad-rock, Mike D and MCA, it just seemed silly to try to pretend that &quot;Sabotage&quot; is somehow a meaningful song that offers context in our troubled times, simply because it mentions the word &quot;Watergate&quot; in the lyrics. And it would have been merely pretending to think that anybody at Hara had the White House, war or waterboarding on their minds while it was playing, I bet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Face it: We loved it cuz it sounded, well, um, awesome!</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As she stood on her front porch with two small pumpkins at her feet, tears begin to roll down the cheeks of Becky Smith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 46-year-old mother of four and 20-year employee with ABX Air is frightened for her future, as are many in this southwest Ohio community of 12,000 that has found itself to be a focal point in this election year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith's job and thousands of others may soon be gone if cargo carrier DHL proceeds with plans to cut costs by hiring United Parcel Service to replace ABX and move the work from the Wilmington Air Park to Louisville, Ky. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been out job hunting, trying to find something,&quot; Smith said. &quot;The worst part is just not knowing. We go into work each day, and we don't know if tomorrow is going to be it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters interviewed this week said the potential loss of 8,000 jobs at ABX and other employers at the air park won't directly affect their presidential choice. They say both candidates have promised to try to help, but neither will likely be able to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think our jobs are gone,&quot; said Smith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the reeling economy is the biggest issue here and elsewhere in the battleground state of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The DHL piece is symbolic of what's going on throughout the economy,&quot; said Stephen Brooks, a political scientist at the University of Akron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the DHL issue itself might not significantly change presidential votes, it may attract votes for a ballot issue proposing to build a $600 million casino a few miles from this Clinton County community. Developers say the casino would create about 5,000 jobs seen by some air park workers as replacement jobs for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brooks said the closer people live to a proposed casino, the more popular it is. And he said the DHL issue will likely make the promise of jobs more appealing to many voters in the area. A current pro-casino commercial features a woman who says she fears losing her air park job and wants a chance to get a job with the new casino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio voters have consistently rejected casinos and expanded gambling, turning down proposals in 1990, 1996 and 2006. But the bleak economy could change some votes this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 2,400 of the 6,000 ABX jobs to be lost would come from Clinton County alone. Most of the rest would be workers who live in nearby Highland, Greene, Montgomery and Fayette counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio political leaders and the presidential campaigns have for months showered attention on the plight of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Republican nominee John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin have visited Wilmington. And Democrat Barack Obama has twice met with community officials and affected workers during stops in nearby Dayton. In addition, both candidates wrote letters that were published in an ABX employee newsletter, expressing their concerns about the air park's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's great that they are aware of the situation, but I'm not sure how much they can do,&quot; said Leilani Popp, assistant manager at Books 'N' More in downtown Wilmington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Lippincott, a manager in aircraft maintenance for ABX, calls the attention being given to Wilmington a &quot;political circus,&quot; and expects the politicians to disappear after Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're more concerned about what kind of public image is going to go out across the country than they are concerned about me,&quot; said the 52-year-old Lippincott as he pulled plywood for a bathroom remodeling project from the pickup truck parked in his driveway. &quot;Nobody talked to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he thinks the casino proposal could hold more hope for the local economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do think it's an opportunity for people to get jobs,&quot; said Lippincott. &quot;I really don't see the harm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economy is a crucial issue in Ohio, a pivotal swing state that gave President Bush the electoral votes he needed for re-election in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Lippincott and Popp said the economy is the biggest issue for them. Lippincott is especially concerned about the state of the economy and how he will afford health care once his job is gone. He's leaning toward voting for Obama, and Popp already has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rural southwest Ohio is a Republican stronghold. In the 2004 presidential election, Clinton County voters went for Republican George Bush over Democrat John Kerry by more than a 2-to-1 margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geoffrey Phillips, chairman of the Clinton County Republican Party, said if any candidate benefits from the DHL situation among voters it will likely be McCain. He said McCain came to Wilmington, later wrote a letter to DHL, and got the first public response from the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawson Adkins, an 86-year-old World War II veteran and retired railroad worker, plans to vote for McCain, in part because of McCain's experience. He said the DHL issue won't be a factor in his vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I sure hate to see DHL pull out, and all these people struggle,&quot; said Adkins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Sracic, chairman of the political science department at Youngstown State University, said the DHL situation has probably amplified the economy as an issue and that the Democrats stand to gain because they are seen as more sympathetic to the concerns of working people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said it is difficult to see how Obama can get much mileage out of it because DHL's situation has nothing to do with tax policy and the jobs aren't going overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It sounds like voters down there are taking a sober look at it and being realistic,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brooks said if the voters blame the DHL situation on the economic policies of the Bush administration, then they may be ready for a change. And he said the tough economy makes it easier for Democrats to persuade Republicans to vote for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Leonard, a political scientist at Wright State University, put it another way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If America has caught an economic cold, Wilmington, Ohio has contracted economic pneumonia,&quot; Leonard said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DES MOINES Iowa</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite John McCain's prediction of an upset, Barack Obama reached for a landslide Friday, invading his rival's home state with TV ads and building a lead in early voting in key battlegrounds as the presidential race headed into a hectic final weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain charged that Obama, bidding to become the first black president, &quot;began his campaign in the liberal left lane of politics and has never left it. He's more liberal than a senator who calls himself a socialist,&quot; he added in Hanoverton, Ohio, a reference to Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet with the economy almost certainly in a recession and the country clamoring for change after eight years of Republican rule, even some of McCain's allies conceded the obvious. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said it would take a &quot;major struggle for him to win&quot; although he quickly added the Arizona senator had come back before when he had been counted out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately, McCain's aides said their man trailed Obama by 4 points nationwide in internal polling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Associated Press-Yahoo News poll of likely voters put the Democrat ahead, 51 to 43, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same survey gave McCain reason to hope one in seven voters, 14 percent of the total said they were undecided or might yet change their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the race for the White House drew most of the attention, minority Republicans in Congress braced for the loss of more seats in both the House and Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some said fresh polling in North Carolina suggested that incumbent GOP Elizabeth Dole had fallen further behind since airing an ad that tried to tie Democratic rival Kay Hagan to atheists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four days before the election, Obama was expanding his reach, and drawing large crowds as he moved methodically from one state to another that voted Republican in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a stop home in Chicago to share Halloween with his two daughters, Obama took a bus ride about 30 miles across the state border, capping his day with a rally in Highland, Ind. &quot;We are four days away from changing the United States of America,&quot; he proclaimed to a cheering crowd on a comfortable October evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indiana is one of about a half-dozen states that went for President twice but remain up for grabs late this election season. Bush won the state by a 60-39 percent margin in 2004, and the competitive nature of the state this time around shows the strength of Obama's standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama used the occasion of Halloween to rib McCain in a new way, saying the Republican wore his usual costume: &quot;Just like every year, he's going as George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in Iowa, Obama said, &quot;What you started here in Iowa has swept the nation.&quot; His victory in the state's Democratic caucuses on Jan. 3 set him on the path to the party's nomination, and now to a lead in the presidential polls in the campaign's final hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One senior adviser said the Illinois senator had been given the names of potential Cabinet and White House staff picks for review but had not had much time to consider them. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama could name a chief of staff as early as next week if he wins the election, in an effort to project a sense of urgency. Aides have contacted Rep. Rahm Emanuel of Illinois to consider a possible appointment to the post, but no job has been offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides announced he would air television commercials in McCain's home state of Arizona as well as in North Dakota and Georgia. He had run ads in the latter two states earlier in the campaign before suspending that effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad in McCain's state was a soft sell in a campaign that has had its share of attacks. This spot featured endorsements from former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Warren Buffett, the nation's best-known investor. Before boarding a flight late Friday for Las Vegas, Obama responded to a shouted question about TV ads in Arizona. &quot;We want to win everywhere,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, dismissed it as a waste. &quot;We encourage them to pick other states that we intend to win&quot; to spend their money, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis contended, &quot;We are witnessing perhaps, I believe, one of the greatest comebacks since John McCain won the primary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately, some Republicans expressed concerned about early voting trends, although the party had yet to unleash its final 72-hour program, designed to reach millions of voters deemed sympathetic to McCain and the Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics showed Democrats ahead among pre-Election Day voters in Iowa, North Carolina, Florida, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada. Bush won all six in 2004, and McCain needs to win most of them to claim the White House this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Georgia, one of the states where Obama began advertising on Friday, official figures show 35 percent of the early votes have been cast by blacks, and lines have been longest in and around reliably Democratic Atlanta. In the 2004 election, blacks accounted for 24 percent of the state's ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was on the second day of a bus tour through battleground Ohio, a state that supported Bush and has voted with the winner in each presidential election for two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're closing, my friends, and we're going to win in Ohio. We're a few points down but we're coming back and we're coming back strong,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later Friday, Schwarzenegger joined him at a rally in Columbus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain has served his country longer in a POW camp than his opponent has in the United States Senate,&quot; Schwarzenegger said. &quot;I only play an action hero in the movies. John McCain is a real action hero.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain hit the same theme in a new television ad that had the feel of a campaign-closing appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In it, he pledged to fix the economy, cut government waste and safeguard the nation's security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've served my country since I was 17 years old. And spent five years longing for her shores. I came home dedicated to a cause greater than my own,&quot; said the former Navy pilot who was shot down, held and tortured for more than five years as a Vietnam prisoner of war.</SPAN></P>

The Republican Congress and President Bush put through a temporary tax break for the highest-income people. Barack Obama wants to let the tax break expire, as the law calls for. John McCain and Sarah Palin call this a &quot;tax increase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's ironic that Sen. John McCain is using &quot;Joe the plumber&quot; to court other blue-collar workers, when even unbiased analyses show that Joe and his buddies would be much better off under Sen. Barack Obama's plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS Ohio</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite both presidential candidates' belief that aggressive action is needed to reduce the country's carbon emissions, talk of climate change has amounted to a mere whisper in the final weeks of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immediate concerns of a lurching economy and the loss of jobs and retirement savings have drowned out nearly everything else. Barack Obama and John McCain have talked extensively about the country's energy challenges, and they frame the debate through the lens of energy security, jobs and lower prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solutions that address reducing dependence on foreign oil don't necessarily lessen carbon emissions, which the vast majority of scientists believe are dangerously warming earth's climate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists who want McCain and Obama to create the political will to reduce carbon emissions face a rigid political reality: the candidates need votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both campaigns certainly understand that the objective of reducing greenhouse gases is going to require more expensive energy in the short and medium run, and that's not what they want to campaign on,&quot; said Andy Keeler, an energy economist at the John Glenn School of Public Affairs at Ohio State University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Votes are especially important in states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, whose economies and electricity industries are heavily dependent on coal a major source of carbon pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defining feature of both candidates' plans to address climate change is a cap-and-trade system, in which limits are placed on carbon emissions and companies have incentives to be cleaner than their competitors. Talk of cap-and-trade has largely been absent from recent campaign rhetoric, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A speech Wednesday in Ohio by McCain's vice presidential pick, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, contained only a couple brief mentions of greenhouse gases or climate change, and listed drilling and clean coal ahead of wind and solar technology in a list of ways to tackle energy problems. Palin has been skeptical of the consensus that climate change is largely a result of human activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigns have sought to use clean-coal technology as a wedge issue. The technology refers to the ability to remove traditional pollutants from coal as well as capture and store the carbon emitted when it's burned. Obama's VP choice, Joe Biden, was recorded saying, &quot;No coal plants here in America&quot; at a campaign stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin then criticized Biden for the remark during the vice presidential debate, but Biden said his comments were taken out of context and that he and Obama support clean coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate change activists view clean coal as a distraction because many experts believe it is 10 to 20 years from being available for deployment on a full-scale, commercial level. Climate scientists have said the world must begin reducing carbon emissions immediately to prevent irreversible damage to glaciers, sea levels, climate patterns and species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1Sky, an organization of youth climate activists, approached the candidates and recorded their responses to questions about climate change and creating green jobs. The candidates were often evasive on their answers, sometimes ignoring the questions or presenting clean coal as a major solution, said 1Sky organizer Carolyn Auwaerter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really been a mixed bag,&quot; said Auwaerter, who believes the candidates should be using their political power to educate the public about what must be done to combat climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Paul Lindsay acknowledged the economic downturn had taken precedence, but said McCain had stood up to fellow Republicans who were skeptics about climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our nation's financial crisis has taken center-stage in this campaign, but John McCain is strongly committed to safeguarding the environment while strengthening our economy at the same time,&quot; Lindsay said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Isaac Baker said Obama's record and positions are clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is committed to combatting climate change by investing in an array of clean and renewable energy technologies,&quot; Baker said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do you mean, you still haven't made up your mind?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As many as one in 10 likely Ohio voters remain unsure which presidential candidate they'll vote for Nov. 4. Some are waiting to be wooed. Others are still sifting through real and virtual mounds of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both candidates are spending a lot of time and money in Ohio trying to generate the kind of reaction they want,&quot; said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Poll at the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For some voters that sends a very mixed message, and they're not ready to choose sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heather Reese, 36, of suburban Columbus says she believes Republican John McCain has more integrity but she prefers Democrat Barack Obama's health care plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's excited about McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, and appreciative of the sacrifices McCain made as a war veteran and POW.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet she's also not convinced that's a reason by itself to vote for McCain. And she believes Obama has done a better job in the three presidential debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Christian, she has voted based on her faith in the past, particularly on topics such as abortion, which usually meant Republican candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today she's wondering if she needs to expand her personal outlook to include topics like health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, it's kind of like, 'Wow, Heather, are you voting as a Christian or are you voting as an American?'&quot; Reese said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reese, an artist and mother of three children, said the reality of huge medical expenses hit home last year when her husband, Stephen, suffered a collapsed lung and the family racked up thousands of dollars in medical bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandra Hamilton, 61, of Cincinnati says she wants to hear more specifics from each candidate on positions important to her, such as Social Security benefits and health insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamilton said the bad economy came at a tough time: she was recently forced to retire after her social work agency lost its funding and shut down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamilton says she's bothered that Obama hasn't identified himself more as a person of mixed race rather than being black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is the son of a black father from Kenya and a white mother. He has talked often of what it was like to grow up with such a diverse background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamilton also says it's clear McCain comes from a privileged upbringing and she wonders how he could identify with the middle class. McCain's father and grandfather were Navy admirals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to know more about each candidate's background and how they got to where they are today,&quot; said Hamilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very frustrated,&quot; she said. &quot;This is the most undecided I've been in my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oct. 13 Marist Poll found Obama leading McCain 48 percent to 40 percent with 11 percent of registered Ohio voters still undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undecided voters drop to 5 percent when respondents are asked which candidate they're leaning toward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the amount of advertising and campaign stops in Ohio, it would seem easy for voters to make up their mind. But this type of attention may also have the opposite effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new national study suggests the campaign's airwaves war may actually make voters in battleground states ambivalent over which candidate to vote for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study found that as campaign ad buys increase, so does the number of things people find they like about each candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people just get confused, others wrestle with it and say, 'This is a hard choice,'&quot; said Luke Keele, an Ohio State University political scientist and co-author of the study published in this month's issue of &quot;Political Psychology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study was based on responses from the 2000 edition of the American National Election Study, a nationally representative survey of voters that looked at 2000 presidential and congressional races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAMPAIGN NOTEBOOK:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sarah Palin was in Findlay Wednesday and was scheduled to join McCain later in the day at rallies near Akron and in Cincinnati. She was set to campaign near Dayton on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat and supporter of Obama, attended an economic round-table Tuesday in Florida with Obama and governors from Michigan, New Mexico and Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michelle Obama planned to hold rallies Friday in Columbus and Akron.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things aren't so bright now, but better days may be coming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the gist of responses by Northeast Ohio business leaders to survey questions that attempt to gauge their sentiment toward the region's economic prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the survey by accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche of local CEOs, law firm partners and other high-level executives, 73% of the 100 respondents said they didn't think Cleveland was doing what it needed to do to improve the economy, while just 14% thought it was. The rest were unsure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, half the respondents said they either were very or somewhat confident the region will be able to improve in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Everyone I know here wants Cleveland to do great,'' said Mark Eisele, vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer of Applied Industrial Technologies and a survey respondent. ``We just need a few things to break our way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Ratner, vice president of sustainability at Forest City Enterprises Inc., said increased confidence in long-term improvement speaks to a philosophical desire on the part of business leaders. Mr. Ratner grew up in Cleveland and returned a year ago, but said he couldn't raise his children here if he thought the city afforded them no opportunities going forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``It's kind of easy to get on the bandwagon that we're in dire straits,'' he said. ``We need to have that hope and belief that every year is a new year.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The non-scientific survey, which was conducted via e-mail from Sept. 29 to Oct. 6, was sent to 924 local business leaders by Deloitte. The firm periodically conducts such surveys and called this year's the Deloitte 2008 Cleveland Business Pulse Election Year Survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Chizmar, office tax managing partner at Deloitte, said the results showed, in part, confidence in regionalism as business leaders remained upbeat about Northeast Ohio's prospects, even if they're unsure about what will happen within Cleveland's city limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``People love this area, they feel very positive about this area,'' Mr. Chizmar said. ``We're going through a bit of a challenge right now. ... There's a desire out there for a change to occur to put Cleveland on the growth map.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crisis of confidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, 72% of the respondents said they were not particularly confident or not at all confident in Northeast Ohio's economy at present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Eisele said he thinks business leaders have hope, but see more challenges than successes. He said shakeups in Cuyahoga County's government and more conversations about regionalism could help break the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I immediately think of the traditional inferiority complex in Cleveland and I see that coming through,'' Mr. Eisele said of the survey results regarding the area's future. ``I look at that and see cautious optimism.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc Byrnes, chairman and CEO of business insurance brokerage Oswald Cos., said he's more optimistic than most. He thinks Northeast Ohio has what it needs to improve, but he understands why some of his peers disagree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Byrnes said the city's arts organizations and its access to water are major assets. He also noted that there's ``something to be said for the Midwest work ethic.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, he said, Northeast Ohio needs to embrace regionalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drill, baby, drill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Deloitte survey also took the pulse of local business leaders on national issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly across the board, local business leaders supported increasing energy availability by any means. Eighty-one percent supported offshore drilling, while 90% advocated more government support for innovative energy solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ratner said energy -- particularly wind energy -- is one of ``a couple of wagons we could hitch ourselves to to carry ourselves into the 21st century.'' He said the opportunity for growth by supplying the wind power industry could improve the region and that there is a nascent movement here to push the technology forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Byrnes is among the 55% of respondents who think the next five years will be better for the region if Sen. John McCain is elected president. Twenty-one percent, including Mr. Ratner, prefer Sen. Barack Obama, and 20% said neither will have any more of an impact on the area than the other. Five percent did not know who would be better for the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ratner said he thinks the 20% of respondents who don't believe either candidate will be better for the region may be basing their opinions on the number of challenges the federal government is facing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``It doesn't necessarily matter who's riding that horse,'' people may be thinking, Mr. Ratner said. ``They're not going to be able to solve our problems.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxing matters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to questions about the economy and the election, the survey also asked a variety of tax questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northeast Ohio's business leaders are strongly in favor of reducing corporate taxes; Mr. Eisele said the city's higher rate puts Cleveland at a disadvantage. Mr. Byrnes noted that Ohioans face an extra burden with the federal alternative minimum tax, as compared to some other states, such as Florida, that don't collect income taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We're getting blown away in the state of Ohio,'' Mr. Byrnes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Eisele said because companies take taxes into consideration when making business decisions, reducing state and local tax rates is critical to promoting job growth in the region.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe the Plumber's story sprang a few leaks Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turns out that the man who was held up by John McCain as the typical, hard-working American taxpayer isn't really a licensed plumber. And court documents show he owes nearly $1,200 in back taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe,&quot; whose name is Samuel J. Wurzelbacher, was cited repeatedly in Wednesday night's final presidential debate by McCain for questioning Barack Obama's tax policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher instantly became a media celebrity, fielding calls during the debate and facing reporters outside his home near Toledo on Thursday morning for an impromptu nationally televised news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The burly, bald man acknowledged he doesn't have a plumber's license, but said he didn't need one because he works for someone else at a company that does residential work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Wurzelbacher still would need to be a licensed apprentice or journeyman to work in Toledo, and he's not, said David Golis, manager and residential building official for the Toledo Division of Building Inspection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State and local records show Wurzelbacher has no license, although his employer does. Golis said there are no records of inspectors citing Wurzelbacher for unlicensed work in Toledo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there was the matter of his taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher owes the state of Ohio $1,182.98 in personal income tax, according to Lucas County Court of Common Pleas records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 2007, Ohio's Department of Taxation filed a claim on his property until he pays the debt, according to the records. The lien remains active.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the debate, McCain cited Wurzelbacher as an example of someone who wants to buy a plumbing business but would be hurt by Obama's tax plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher, a self-described conservative, had spoken to Obama at a rally Sunday near his home and asked him whether his tax plan would keep him from buying the business that currently employs him, which earns more than $250,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your new tax plan is going to tax me more, isn't it?&quot; Wurzelbacher asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said that under his proposal taxes on any revenue from $250,000 on down would stay the same, but that amounts above that level would be subject to a 39 percent tax, instead of the current 36 percent rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said Obama's plan would stop entrepreneurs such as Wurzelbacher from investing in new small businesses and keep existing ones from growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign posted a Web ad featuring the exchange between Wurzelbacher and Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an afternoon taping of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman,&quot; McCain said he had not yet spoken to Wurzelbacher, and apologized for the press attention he had received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe, if you're watching, I'm sorry,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher had to deal with a clog of two dozen reporters outside his home on a narrow street lined with ranch- and split-level homes Thursday morning. No detail about the divorced father of a 13-year-old boy was too small: Was he a registered voter? Did he have a plumbing license? Whom will he vote for?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaning against his black Dodge Durango SUV, Wurzelbacher at first was amused by it all, then overwhelmed and finally a little annoyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have a lot of pull. It's not like I'm Matt Damon,&quot; he said &quot;I just hope I'm not making too much of a fool of myself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated he was a fan of the military and McCain but wouldn't say who will get his vote. He is registered as a Republican, the county elections board said, because he voted in the GOP primary in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher said a McCain campaign official contacted him several days before the debate to ask him to appear with the candidate at a Toledo rally scheduled for Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told reporters he's unsure if he'll attend, since he's now scheduled to be in New York for TV interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday in New Hampshire, Obama said McCain was misleading voters by proposing tax plans that favor the rich while criticizing an Obama tax plan that would raise taxes only on people making more than $250,000 a year, just 5 percent of all taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's trying to suggest that a plumber is the guy he's fighting for,&quot; Obama said. &quot;How many plumbers you know that are making a quarter-million dollars a year?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher said he felt a bit overwhelmed by all the attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm kind of like Britney Spears having a headache. Everybody wants to know about it,&quot; he joked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adlai Stevenson - the Democratic presidential nominee way back in 1952 and 1956 - famously remarked that a certain political convention had reached the point at which everything that could possibly be said had been said, but not everybody had said it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 2008 presidential election, it might now be said that everything that could possibly be heard has been heard, but perhaps not everybody has heard. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going into Wednesday night's debate between Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain, good citizens who have been listening all along had the sense that they were now hearing things for the umpteenth time. But different people tune into campaigns at different times. So a little tolerance of repetition is called for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, after all, some merit to the point of Obama adviser David Axelrod before the debate: &quot;We're not in the business of reinventing ourselves from debate to debate. That's not what Obama is going to do. He's been very consistent for 20 months. He'll be very consistent tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That promise made life easy for Rob Portman. That former congressman from southwest Ohio had been playing Sen. Obama in Sen. McCain's preparations. (Who do you suppose played Gov. Sarah Palin in Sen. Joe Biden's preparations for the vice presidential debate: Tina Fey?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the promise of consistency, Sen. Obama did diligently prepare for the debate. He chose Ohio as the site for his preparations because, uh, the water here is highly praised by other debaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In truth, Sen. Obama was not the object of the greatest interest. What everybody really wanted to know was what rabbit Sen. John McCain would try to pull out of his hat. The polls have been trending south, and it's getting late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did he find a rabbit? He was sharp, aggressive and ready. Ohioan Joe the Plumber was his theme of the night. But the point that Sen. Obama's tax plans would hurt one particular person whose business was going to make more than $250,000 a year does not seem likely to move many people, nor should it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. McCain did settle some speculation by raising the subject of William Ayers, a formerly violent radical and a minor acquaintance of Sen. Obama, as well as the matter of the senator's ties to ACORN, the liberal group that has now been accused of fraud in voter-registration efforts in many states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some deluded partisans have seen magic in these issues for Sen. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In raising them, Sen. McCain seemed almost to be trying to placate those people and to justify the use of those subjects in his ads and speeches. But he didn't push very hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concentrated pretty much on policy issues. He took every opportunity to critique his opponent's plans and record. The result was a useful debate. It might have bored some people at some times. But to those willing to take another look, there's real meat, as to their differences on taxes, health care, abortion and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, Sen. McCain was more dismissive and critical of his opponent as a person. More than once, for example, he accused him of being cute with words. In truth, Sen. McCain is every bit as cute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. McCain had a tough assignment. Nobody has ever actually pulled a rabbit out of a hat in a late debate to turn things around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressure he has been under from right-wing &quot;supporters&quot; to find the magic rabbit by getting rougher with Sen. Obama is amazing. He has been intensely critical in debates and relentlessly negative in his commercials. A check a couple of weeks ago showed that all his commercials were negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he has stopped short of calling Sen. Obama a terrorist, an Arab or a Muslim. The wimp!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In truth, though, both sides can go negative forever. There's always plenty of material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence that the negative, personal stuff is working in this election is decidedly scant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Sen. McCain could really have benefited from finding, upon reaching into his hat, was a rabbit that has a quick solution to the nation's long-term and short-term economic and international ills. Short of that, it's not about rabbits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CINCINNATI Ohio</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama pulling ahead of Republican rival John McCain in national polls this week, Cincinnati Democrat Steve Driehaus must be one happy camper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Driehaus, a state senator seeking to unseat U.S. Rep. Steve Chabot, has staked his hopes for victory against a moderate incumbent on a number of factors. But key among them is heavy expected turnout among black voters energized by Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call it the Obama Effect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio's 1st District, which encompasses portions of Cincinnati and its northern and western suburbs, has the largest black population of any congressional district in the nation held by a Republican. For that reason, it is among the chief targets of national Democrats as they seek to shore up their congressional majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other incumbent Republicans could also be hurt by Obama's presence at the top of the ticket and the ensuing surge in participation by blacks favorable to the Democratic agenda. Among those in danger are U.S. Reps. Thelma Drake of Virginia and Robin Hayes of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seats left open by congressional retirements are also considered vulnerable to party turnover if blacks turn out in record force to vote for Obama. Those include the seats of Republicans Jim McCrery of Louisiana and Terry Everett of Alabama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent polls are split on who Ohioans will favor for president, Obama or Republican John McCain. The state picked George Bush in both 2000 and 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chabot has held a consistent lead, and a significant fundraising advantage, over Driehaus throughout the campaign but some of his close victories in the past have been dependent on his crossover appeal with Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Republican Congressional Committee views the district as high priority, said spokesman Ken Spain. He acknowledged that a surge in voter registrations and turnout among blacks this year could play a role in the outcome. But he said he believes the economy will remain the campaign's central issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this race is ultimately going to be about the economy,&quot; Spain said. &quot;Particularly in states like Ohio, where joblessness is on the rise, foreclosures are up, and voters are going to want to know from either of the two candidates running for Congress what they plan to do to get the economy up and running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee began airing a new anti-Driehaus ad on Wednesday, its second in a week. The spot attacks Driehaus for &quot;opposing tax cuts for the middle class&quot; and missing a vote on a bill addressing Ohio's foreclosure crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chabot's own campaign has stuck to running positive, mostly biographical ads with an emphasis on his humble beginnings as a trailer park kid who pumped gas and cut lawns to make ends meet. The images in the ads have become more diverse as the Obama campaign went from viable to successful over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chabot's ad, &quot;Independent Voice,&quot; features a class photograph of teacher Chabot surrounded by a class of black students from Cincinnati's west end, and a frame of him speaking to a black constituent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many black voters are convinced that voting Democratic is the way to go this year, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Steve Chabot reminds me of someone who's all for Bush and Bush always,&quot; said Darlene Bobo, 46, an electroplater in the Mount Washington neighborhood at the heart of his district. She said she favors Obama over McCain, and Driehaus over Chabot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But getting Bobo, who said she is of mixed race, to turn out to vote may be a challenge. &quot;I don't want to get involved in it,&quot; she said. &quot;Whatever it is, it's going to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobilizing skeptical voters has been a strength of the Obama campaign's ground game in Ohio, and the job has been made easier as his backers have viewed themselves as supporting a winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Ohio Newspaper Poll released Sunday showed McCain and Obama neck-and-neck, with 48 percent and 46 percent respectively, among likely voters. Three weeks ago, the poll had McCain leading 48-42.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAIRBORN - The recent media invasion of Wasilla, Alaska, caught new Bombers defenseman Nathan Schwartzbauer a little off guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I first saw that Sarah Palin was named as the vice-presidential candidate, I thought it was a joke,&quot; said Schwartzbauer, a Wasilla native. &quot;I couldn't believe it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then his dad's friend received a request from Larry King for an interview and a high school friend was tapped to read a Top 10 List on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman.&quot; It wasn't a joke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I actually think it's very cool,&quot; Schwartzbauer said. &quot;I watch Leno and Letterman, and it's fun watching the news now, too.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schwartzbauer had some fun with the media before arriving in Dayton for training camp last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was at home training for the season and I'd be practicing with some other guys and we'd see a camera crew set up at one end of the ice for no reason,&quot; he said. &quot;So, we'd all pick up and move to the other end so the crew would have to move, too. We made a game of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin served two terms as mayor of Wasilla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our families know each other, and I played hockey with her oldest son (Track),&quot; Schwartzbauer, 26, said. &quot;She spoke at my younger brother's graduation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 6-foot-4 Schwartzbauer, who calls himself &quot;Alaskan through and through,&quot; is a commercial fisherman who spends the summer netting sockeye salmon. An avid Palin supporter, he is undecided about the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Palin has done a lot of good things for the state, but she's not the one who is running for president,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm still up in the air about Obama or McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics will take a back seat to hockey this week as Schwartzbauer and the Bombers prepare to open their 18th season Saturday, Oct. 18. against the defending Kelly Cup Champion Cincinnati Cyclones at the Nutter Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schwartzbauer, who was named the Youngstown Steelhounds' most improved player last season, had three goals, eight assists and 62 penalty minutes in 64 games with the CHL squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bombers opener</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What: Cincinnati Cyclones at Dayton Bombers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where: Nutter Center</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When: 7:30 p.m., Saturday, Oct. 18 </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this unhappy passage, the nation faces a happy choice: a brilliant young man offering a new generation of leadership - and a remarkable turning point in the nation's history - opposes an accomplished veteran who has punched all the right tickets in his rise toward the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both are thoughtful, modern people alert to the real problems of the world and the nation. Neither should be chosen because the other is frightening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain has earned the now-overworked term &quot;maverick.&quot; He has bucked his party far more often than most. And yet the record is more complex. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was most dramatically independent after his run for the presidency in 2000 when he lost to George W. Bush in a bitter fight. He simply went to war with President Bush, opposing his signature tax reduction, disagreeing on environmental issues, opposing his energy initiative and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. McCain seemed to be in the process of leaving the Republican Party. Democrats saw him as a possible member of their ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he changed after 2004. He joined the Republican team on taxes. He gradually moved to the right on immigration. He told the conservative wing of the party what it wanted to hear on Supreme Court appointments, even though the appointment of hard-line conservatives is likely to doom the campaign-finance reform law that epitomized his work in his maverick days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The McCain-Feingold law created spending limits on national parties and imposed rules about the financing of non-candidate ads that run during a campaign. Opponents see it as an infringement on free speech.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign disappointing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. McCain's campaign has been as disappointing as his move toward party orthodoxy. More than his opponent, he has run a relentless stream of commercials that have been discredited by nonpartisan fact-checkers. (Last week, all his ads were negative.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has articulated no vision for the country other than to suggest that it should believe in him as an individual, as a war hero of independent judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate was stunning. She is shockingly lacking in presidential qualifications. Some of Sen. McCain's most enthusiastic supporters have been forced to admit this. Her defenders say her resume compares well with Sen. Obama's, but it does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alaska is tiny in population and atypical in its issues. And she'd been governor for only a year and a half when she was tapped. At any rate, as some interviews have shown, she's no Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. McCain presents her as a fellow &quot;maverick.&quot; Nonsense. The important sense in which he's been a maverick has been his willingness to flout conservative orthodoxy. But she's an orthodox conservative and then some, opposing abortion even in cases of rape and incest, and, for example, long denying man-made global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was Sen. McCain, in selecting her, making a cynical effort to get the hard-core conservatives excited? Or was he just wrong about how unready she is? It hardly matters. He royally blew the most important decision he has ever had to make in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selection undercuts Sen. McCain's effort to sell himself as the one who is most ready for the presidency. So does another momentous decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was one of the most gung-ho advocates of the Iraq war. He confirmed in the first presidential debate (right at the end) that he sees Iraq as the great cause of our time. It is no such thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that there were no weapons of mass destruction, given that there were no important ties between Saddam Hussein and the perpetrators of 9/ 11, given that al-Qaida is resurgent today, Iraq is a tragically costly diversion from a sound foreign policy, which, of course, must focus on the terrorist threat where it really exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Sen. McCain was right - while Barack Obama was wrong - about the &quot;surge&quot; in American forces in Iraq last year is beyond dispute. Too little, though, and too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Obama's opposition to the war goes a long way toward making the case that experience isn't necessarily the magic ingredient in making a national leader. Nevertheless, many millions of Americans have been appropriately skeptical that somebody who only came to the U.S. Senate after the 2004 election, and hasn't been a governor, is the best</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pick for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They must be comforted, though, by Sen. Obama's cool, even masterful performance in the campaign. Nobody could have expected any more. He has made his supporters proud, as Sen. McCain has made his supporters wonder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Sen. McCain pretended to suspend his campaign, to help Washington through the bailout crisis, it looked like a clever move by a veteran warrior. But the new guy deflated it gracefully and easily, noting that he and Sen. McCain ought to be able to do two things at once, if the second was as important as a presidential debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added to their vice-presidential decisions, and to the ability of the younger man to stand next to the veteran in debates and demonstrate every bit as much command of issues, the bailout incident was a suggestion of readiness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has been in the public spotlight for four years (since his memorable debut speech at his party's 2004 convention). He has withstood relentless, withering attacks. The more attacks he survives, the more comfortable people seem with the idea of him as a leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With any candidate, there are doubts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issues, he is in the liberal mainstream of the Democratic Party. He worries less about the taxes of the people at the top of the economic system than those in the middle. He unambiguously embraces decent health care as a &quot;right.&quot; He would like to put more public resources into education and efforts to extend the American dream to those still dreaming. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He favors more regulation of Wall Street. He sees diplomacy as underused by the current president. He wants - perhaps unrealistically - to shape trade treaties so that they work better for American workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any alert citizen must be skeptical that Sen. Obama can accomplish all he wants, must know that he has not answered all the reasonable questions about his plans, must wonder about the tradeoffs. But such doubts are there about all candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some people, the liberal tag makes Sen. Obama a nonstarter. But he built his early appeal around the promise to get beyond the liberal-conservative wars, to show a level of respect for the views of others that helps build a new kind of politics. It is his most ambitious promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Republican Party is asking the American people to ignore their discontent with President George W. Bush and give the party another chance. But if a party can retain the presidency after failing in it - just by putting up somebody different - then accountability is undercut. Failure should exact a political price. If it doesn't, failure becomes harder to deter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's moment of choice arrives even as some sort of new era has arrived in the realm of the economy. The problems the nation is obsessed with at this moment are not problems that John McCain has any particular experience with. Neither does Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a time of change, Sen. Obama is the more promising leader. With his agile mind, often pitch-perfect judgment and preternatural calm and self-confidence, he seems built for the job of sorting through this thing, if anybody can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation faces a choice that looks more and more like a choice between the future and the past. It has never been one to shrink from the future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in Scioto County in Appalachia, Obama suffered his biggest drubbing in Ohio's Democratic primary in March. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton got 81 percent of the vote en route to her victory statewide, while Obama got just 16 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama started Thursday, Oct. 9, with a rally in Dayton at Fifth Third Field. He then held a rally in Cincinnati and finished his first day with a rally at Shawnee State University in Portsmouth, accompanied by native son Gov. Ted Strickland, who backed Clinton in the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama told the cheering crowd that Strickland was a &quot;hometown boy done good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Dayton rally, Gene Powers, 57, of Piqua wore a baseball cap that said &quot;U.S. Navy Retired,&quot; but he's not supporting fellow Navy veteran and Republican presidential nominee John McCain. McCain hasn't voted for needed veterans' benefits, said Powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's for the working class American people,&quot; said Powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama supporters lined up Thursday morning outside Fifth Third Field before gates opened at 9 a.m., starting from the plaza in front of the main entrance, around the corner and down Second Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them was Daionna Woodall, 17, shivering in a denim jacket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm always cold, but it's worth it to be here,&quot; said Woodall, a Trotwood-Madison High School student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today Obama heads for another Appalachian destination, Chillicothe in Ross County, where Clinton got nearly 70 percent in the primary to about 30 percent for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his first Appalachian stop Thursday at the Fireside Restaurant in Georgetown in Brown County, Obama got a warm reception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was awesome to meet him,&quot; said Tyler Fox, 11. His grandfather, Dennis Liming, 53, was impressed but hasn't decided between Obama and McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's two early Thursday stops were in friendly Montgomery and Hamilton counties - two of the five counties he carried in the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He'll be at a third one today in Columbus in Franklin County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strickland, from Duck Run just down the road from Portsmouth, has said it's important for Obama to appeal personally to conservative and moderate Democrats here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2004 general election, Democrat John Kerry won big in urban areas such as Cleveland but Bush beat him in Appalachia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Dayton, Obama got a hero's reception. He blasted McCain's leadership as &quot;erratic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said McCain's plan for the Treasury secretary to buy up bad mortgages at their face values would cost taxpayers and reward greedy lenders who caused the financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds said the plan wouldn't cost taxpayers and accused Obama of putting politics above the national interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on Thursday, Obama spokesman Bill Burton said Obama plans to air a 30-minute commercial during prime time on Oct. 29, six days before Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton said the campaign has secured the time from CBS and is negotiating with other networks to air the halfhour spot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A campaign finance watchdog group on Friday filed a complaint with federal regulators against two groups one pro-Republican and the other pro-Democrat alleging they violated the law by airing political ads during the presidential contest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democracy 21 wants the Federal Election Commission to investigate the American Issues Project, which ran a $2.8 million ad campaign in Michigan and Ohio against Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama, and the American Leadership Project, a group that backed Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries and ran about $4.3 million in ads supporting her or against Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint argues that both groups violated the law by not operating as a political action committee, which would have restricted their fundraising to capped donations. The American Leadership Project was largely financed by unions that supported Clinton. The American Issues Project ad against Obama was paid for by Texas billionaire Harold Simmons, a McCain fundraiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FEC complaint we filed today is intended to help ensure that the FEC continues to take enforcement action against any illegal activities by outside spending groups that may occur in the 2008 election,&quot; said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Issues Project is a nonprofit 501(c)4 organization. It ran ads in August in Michigan and Ohio linking Obama to William Ayers, a Vietnam-era militant who helped found the violent Weather Underground. Ayers, now a university professor in Chicago, has worked on charity and education projects with Obama and hosted a political meet-and-greet for Obama in the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a 501(c)4 organization, the group must have as its main purpose a mission other than seeking to influence elections. Wertheimer also wrote to the Internal Revenue Service asking the IRS to examine whether the group violated its nonprofit status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, American Issues Project President Ed Martin said the group complies with the law because most of its activities are nonpolitical. &quot;This is a totally spurious complaint we are well aware of the requirements of the law and are in complete compliance with those requirements,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Leadership Project was created as a 527 group, named after the section of the tax code that governs them. Its main contributors were the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the American Federation of Teachers. The group also ran a radio ad against McCain in Colorado against McCain during he Democratic National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Salazar, president of the group, said the organization &quot;has taken every step to ensure we are meeting all federal rules and requirements. We have been open and transparent and have made all appropriate disclosures.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAYTON Ohio</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama told Ohio voters Thursday that Republican John McCain's mortgage buyout plan would cost them billions of dollars and reward bad behavior by lenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Dayton as he started a two-day bus tour of hotly contested Ohio, Obama said McCain's plan would force the government to absorb the full cost of renegotiating mortgages to keep borrowers from losing their homes. He said lenders should share some of the costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic presidential candidate's campaign also criticized McCain's mortgage plan in a new 30-second ad to air nationally on cable TV, a relatively inexpensive way of drawing media attention to an issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates are competing hard for Ohio's 20 electoral votes, which were pivotal in President Bush's victory four years ago. Obama campaigned in Dayton, Cincinnati, Georgetown and Portsmouth on Thursday, with two more Ohio stops planned Friday. He will return next week to Toledo to prepare for Wednesday's debate on Long Island, N.Y.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama took another jab at McCain, whose family owns several houses, when he renewed his call to change bankruptcy laws to help hard-pressed borrowers keep their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, the law lets bankruptcy judges write down your mortgage if you own six or seven homes,&quot; he said, &quot;but not if you have only one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That might help Sen. McCain sleep easier at night, but it won't do anything for folks like you,&quot; Obama told thousands at a baseball stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said McCain's mortgage plan &quot;punishes taxpayers, rewards banks and won't solve our housing crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it would &quot;guarantee that American taxpayers lose by handing over $300 billion to underwrite the kind of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street that got us into this mess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign, meanwhile, has changed its mortgage plan. When first described, the planned called for the government to buy failed mortgages at discounted rates. Conservatives had pushed for that language because many of the homes are not worth the amount mortgaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Wednesday the campaign deleted that line, which would mean the government would pay the full value of the mortgage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said the policy didn't change, but an edit was made to remove &quot;excess and confusing language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move would make the plan more costly than the $300 million price tag initially cited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has said his plan is expensive but necessary to get thousands of bad mortgages off the books and to stop the fall in home values and credit availability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds said the plan represents &quot;no new expense to the taxpayer, but simply refocuses priorities to more directly assist the homeowners who are hurting instead of greed on Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the government should use some of the $700 billion in the newly enacted financial rescue plan to buy up troubled mortgages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we need to do it in a responsible way,&quot; he said. The government should not overpay for the mortgages, he said, or reward &quot;the very lenders whose recklessness helped cause this crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxpayers should be assured &quot;a share of the benefits when our housing market recovers,&quot; he said, and the government should crack down &quot;predatory lenders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying McCain has offered widely different economic proposals lately, Obama added, &quot;I don't think we can afford that kind of erratic and uncertain leadership in these uncertain times.&quot; Some Republicans say the word &quot;erratic&quot; is meant to raise doubts about McCain's age, 72.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign criticized McCain's mortgage plan Wednesday, but Thursday marked the first time Obama addressed it himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new Obama campaign TV ad says McCain &quot;would shift the burden from lenders to taxpayers, guaranteeing a loss of taxpayer money&quot; and rewarding lenders &quot;that caused the crisis in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to about 8,000 people in Dayton under sunny skies, Obama veered occasionally from his prepared text to make lighthearted asides. Stock values have dropped so sharply, he said, that many people's retirement accounts are now &quot;101(k)s&quot; instead of 401(k)s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the day, Obama reacted to news that stocks plunged anew Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 679 points, by urging the Treasury Department to quickly implement the rescue plan &quot;so that we can ease this credit crisis that's preventing businesses and consumers from getting loans and causing dangerous instability in our market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an event at an outdoor park in Cincinnati, Obama greeted diners at the Fireside Restaurant in Georgetown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is playing it safe. Leading in polls with 25 days to Election Day, the Democratic nominee is offering careful proposals to address the economic crisis while letting allies respond to John McCain's sharpest charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama now reads his speeches from teleprompters, reducing the chance of gaffes. He has not held a press conference in two weeks, although he has done several one-on-one interviews with national and local reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He now refers to Republican John McCain as &quot;my opponent&quot; more often than by name. And he offers carefully limited, comparatively non-controversial remedies for the nation's financial crisis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publicly, Obama's aides say he keeps a calm demeanor and measured tone because he doesn't want to fuel the anguish and panic caused by the economic meltdown. Privately, they acknowledge there is no desire to shake up a campaign dynamic that is inching him closer to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't like to yell,&quot; Obama told more than 10,000 people in Columbus on Friday, his fifth large rally in hotly contested Ohio in two days. He was referring to a sound-system glitch, but it could have been a metaphor for his home-stretch strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's responding just right, and the polls are reflecting it,&quot; said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who campaigned with Obama this week and helped lead the counterattacks against McCain. When GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin spoke in Ohio on Thursday, Brown said, she spent too much time on issues such as Obama's ties to Vietnam War-era radical William Ayers, now a college professor in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are saying, 'What about our jobs, what about the banking situation?'&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday as McCain rolled out a new TV ad with his sharpest language yet about Ayers, the sharpest Democratic response came from Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, who told an audience in Springfield, Mo., that McCain is trying to &quot;take the lowest road to the highest office in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is seeking a careful balance these days. He criticizes details of McCain's chief economic proposals, and he briefly and broadly disputes Republican attacks on his character, not getting into details. That seems to satisfy Democratic stalwarts who feel recent nominees were too slow to respond to character attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama devotes more time to explaining his own long-standing proposals for tax cuts and energy investments. On Friday, he added a temporary program of tax breaks, low-interest government and government-backed private loans for small businesses having trouble borrowing to meet payrolls, maintain inventories or expand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When this careful rhetoric threatened to bore crowds seeking rhetorical fireworks and when the economic problems turned into a crisis, he added more upbeat lines to his stump speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now is not the time for fear,&quot; Obama said at every Ohio stop this week. &quot;Now is the time for resolve and steady leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless asked, he does not mention McCain's and Palin's fiercest line of attack: that he has associated with Ayers, a former 1960s radical who helped found the violent Weather Underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly, high-profile supporters take the sharper jabs at McCain before Obama comes on stage. On a sunny street with a few thousand people in Chillicothe, Ohio, on Friday, Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland played the part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The McCain-Palin campaign and some of their followers unfortunately want you to be afraid of Barack Obama,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;others&quot; have spread untruths about the nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama does not leave all the heavy lifting to surrogates. Referring to McCain and Palin, he told the Chillicothe audience, &quot;it's not hard to rile up a crowd by stoking anger and division.&quot; He said Americans want &quot;someone who can lead this country&quot; in a time of economic crisis, not divide it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that McCain advisers have said their candidate will lose if the campaign's focus stays on the economy, Obama said: &quot;So in the last couple of days, we've seen a barrage of nasty insinuations and attacks, and I'm sure we'll see much more over the next 25 days. We know what's coming. ... But it won't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is playing it safe on policy, too, avoiding the far-reaching proposals that have caused McCain headaches. McCain's call this week for the government to buy bad home-loan mortgages at full face value and renegotiate them at a reduced price set off loud protests from conservatives and liberals alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's proposals have been more limited. His proposal Friday to temporarily extend an expiring tax break that lets small businesses immediately write off investments would cover only investments up to $250,000. It would cost the Treasury $900 million, Obama aides said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain 'Foundation' ad By Laura Bischoff | Dayton Daily News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;Foundation,&quot; 30 seconds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Producer: McCain campaign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where to see it: It's scheduled to be televised nationally. View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/eyeonohio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: John McCain: &quot;You, the American workers, are the best in the world. But your economic security has been put at risk by the greed of Wall Street. That's unacceptable. My opponent's only solutions are talk and taxes. I'll reform Wall Street and fix Washington. I've taken on tougher guys than this before. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Female Anchor: &quot;Change is coming. John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain: &quot;I'm John McCain and I approve this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: It opens with McCain speaking to the camera, slowly zooming in on his face and then interspersed with photos of Wall Street, the stock market trading floor and Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. Joe Biden. It closes with a photo of McCain talking on a rather large cell phone and then a photo of McCain in front of an American flag with the words &quot;The Original Maverick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: The ad focuses on the slumping economy and workers' fears about job and investment security. Stylistically, it's a bit different - none of the typical scary music or grainy black-and-white unflattering photos of the opponent. Instead, McCain speaks directly to the camera and viewers. His only attack on Obama is that his &quot;only solutions are talk and taxes&quot; but the ad reveals no details of how McCain would help the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll reform Wall Street and fix Washington. I've taken on tougher guys than this before,&quot; McCain says with a bit of a grin. McCain, who has been in Washington for 26 years, uses two taglines in the ad: &quot;Change is coming&quot; and &quot;The Original Maverick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the scenes, the McCain camp points to the Arizona senator's push for shareholder approval of corporate chief executives' pay and severance packages and his pledge to reform laws and regulations governing the oil futures market to curb speculators driving up gas prices, and his efforts to require corporations to list employee stock options as an expense on their financial statements. The Obama campaign this week also released a two-minute video focused on economic security that promises a laundrylist of vague solutions, including tax reform, real regulations for Wall Street and fast-tracking energy independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laura Bischoff is a reporter for the Dayton Daily News. E-mail: lbischoff@DaytonDailyNews.com Obama 'Spending Spree' ad By Jessica Wehrman | Dayton Daily News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;Spending Spree,&quot; 30 seconds Producer: Obama campaign Where to see it: It's airing nationally. View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/eyeonohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: Barack Obama: &quot;I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.&quot; John McCain voice-over: &quot;I can't wait to introduce her ... to the big spenders in Washington, D.C.&quot; Announcer: &quot;Big spenders ... like John McCain. McCain's tax plan means another three trillion in debt. His plan to privatize Social Security - another trillion. Tax credits sent to insurance companies, yet another trillion. So as we borrow from China to fund his spending spree, ask yourself. Can we afford John McCain?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: The ad begins with Obama at a picnic, then shows shots of McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin, then cuts to a shot of McCain and his wife, Cindy, then back to McCain. Then there are shots of McCain smiling with the words &quot;John McCain's Plan: Over $3 Trillion in Debt,&quot; then the words &quot;John McCain's Plan: Social Security Privatization $1.4 trillion.&quot; Next, the words &quot;Tax Credits Sent to Insurance Companies $1.3 trillion.&quot; It then cuts to shots of China, closing on a shot of McCain and George W. Bush. The words on the screen: &quot;Can we afford John McCain?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: Here's a counter punch to the long-tried GOP attack that Democrats are big spenders. In this one, Obama throws it back in McCain's face, suggesting that he is the true big spender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tax Policy Center, whose data the campaign uses, actually says Obama has it wrong: According to its most recent analysis of the candidates' tax plans, McCain's plan would increase the debt by $5 trillion on top of the $2.3 trillion increase that the Congressional Budget Office forecasts for the next decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's far higher than the $3 trillion cited in the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center says that Obama's plan would boost the debt by $3.5 trillion by 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These estimates assume, however, that there aren't substantial cuts in spending. Both McCain and Obama have vowed to do just that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the most recent presidential debate, McCain floated the idea of freezing spending except on defense, veterans and a few other vital programs that he didn't elaborate on. Obama opposed the idea, saying some programs are worthy investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second number - estimating McCain's plan to privatize Social Security would cost $1.4 trillion - comes from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It estimates the cost of privatizing Social Security under President Bush's plan at $1.4 trillion over the first 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain voted in favor of creating Social Security accounts in the past, but has not spoken about privatization much during the general election. According to factcheck.org, however, he said on March 3 that he is &quot;totally in favor of personal savings account, and I think they are an important opportunity for young workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, on the $1.3 trillion in tax credits sent to insurance companies: McCain wants to change how people get their health insurance by shifting from job-based coverage to an open market where people would chose from competing policies. McCain would offer families a $5,000 tax credit to help buy insurance policies. Everyone would get the credit, regardless of whether they kept a policy through an employer or shopped for a new one.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE POLL: Washington Post-ABC News poll of 772 likely Ohio voters (20 electoral votes).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NUMBERS: Barack Obama, 51 percent; John McCain, 45 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OF INTEREST: Obama's lead revolves around the worry about the economy. Those who say it is the biggest issue favor Obama 61-34 percent; those who say the biggest issue is something else back McCain 57-38 percent. Obama is generating more enthusiasm among his voters: 58 percent say they are very enthusiastic while 30 percent say the same about McCain. Women are solidly backing Obama 56-42 percent; in 2004 they split evenly between George W. Bush and John Kerry. Only about half of all Ohio voters think Obama is experienced enough to be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DETAILS: The poll was conducted by telephone Oct. 3-5 with 772 likely voters out of a total sample of 1,010 adults in Ohio. The sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE POLL: A WISH-TV Indiana Poll of likely Indiana voters (11 electoral votes).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NUMBERS: John McCain 46 percent, Barack Obama 46 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OF INTEREST: Most recent statewide polls have shown a tight race in Indiana, where a Democratic presidential candidate last won in 1964. A similar poll of the state by the same company released last week found McCain with 46 percent support to Obama's 45 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DETAILS: Conducted Sept. 29-Oct. 3 by telephone of 800 likely voters by Maryland-based Research 2000. Margin of error plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MORE: http://www.wishtv.com/</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE POLL: CNN/Time magazine/Opinion Research Corp. of 859 likely voters in Wisconsin (10 electoral votes).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NUMBERS: Obama 51, McCain 46.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OF INTEREST: The poll is in line with other recent surveys showing Obama with a small lead in Wisconsin, but the race remains close. CNN says the numbers are enough to put Wisconsin in the &quot;leaning toward Obama&quot; category instead of a toss-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DETAILS: Conducted Oct. 3-6 by telephone. The poll has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some Ohio voters, Election Day has come and gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That reality, brought by the Sept. 30 start of absentee voting, has altered the way politicians go about the business of wooing voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Election Day is now 35 days long,'' said Leesa Brown, communications director for Richard Cordray, the Democrat running for attorney general against Republican Mike Crites. ``It really changes the game.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not just a Democratic notion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Early voting changes a lot of things'' in terms of campaign strategy, said Jim Trakas, a Republican who's trying to unseat U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, the Demo-cratic incumbent in the 10th Congressional District. Mr. Trakas began his first wave of broadcast ads last week, even though he isn't sure how much money his campaign will have available to spend once it draws closer to the Nov. 4 finish line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change in absentee voting rules actually came before the 2006 elections, but this is the first high-turnout presidential campaign under the new law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ohio Legislature in 2005 passed a law allowing any voter to cast what used to be an absentee ballot 35 days before a general election and 25 days before a presidential primary. This ``no excuse'' rule boosted voting in the 2006 elections, but will have its full impact this year due to the interest in the John McCain/Barack Obama presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas in the past 10% to 15% of total votes statewide were cast in advance, that percentage is expected to rise beyond 30% this year, candidates and campaign observers told Crain's Cleveland Business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Up to one-third or more of voters will vote by mid-October,'' predicted Rob Frost, chairman of the Cuyahoga County Republican Party. ``You're going to see both sides getting their voters out earlier.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's already happening. Last Tuesday, Sept. 30, a trolley working the streets of downtown Cleveland for the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party featured a woman on a loudspeaker instructing pedestrians on how they could vote early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is an advantage to be gained from the new voting pattern, observers say, it likely will go to those politicians who planned ahead, Republican or Democrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eve Sandburg, a campaign consultant and professor of political science at Oberlin College, said for campaigns to be successful, they now ``have to be more organized earlier.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She described how in Lorain County, the Obama campaign and the campaign of U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur, Democratic incumbent in the 9th Congressional district, in August began to go door-to-door jointly in order to identify which households were for Sen. Obama and which were undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now they are beginning a second wave of home visits, starting with people they believe are in their camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``With an early voting opportunity, they are getting to their strong supporters and getting them to vote early,'' Ms. Sandburg said. ``That means they can concentrate later not so much on getting their own base out, but to go after the undecideds and persuadables.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidates must be more strategic in spending their campaign war chests than they've been in the past, according to Mr. Frost. In earlier campaigns, local candidates could get the list of voters who requested absentee ballots and then send each absentee voter a postcard message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Now, there are so many absentee voters that candidates have to be selective (about who they send a postcard) because of the cost of the mailing,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The better-prepared campaigns also began pushing their messages earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``You're going to see more TV ads, more mailings earlier,'' Mr. Frost said. ``If someone decides to vote early and they were persuadable, you miss out on the opportunity to get your message to them (before they vote).''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Target market</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cordray campaign began its first wave of television ads across the state last week. Ms. Brown, the campaign's communications director, said the first ad ran in 11 television markets between Oct. 1 and Oct. 7. But she couldn't say how many times the spot would air. ``It's in the high hundreds,'' was her best estimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We'll be (on the air) for a week, see how it goes and assess what things look like for the final stretch of the campaign,'' Ms. Brown said. ``I'm sure we'll go up again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Brown couldn't say how much the Cordray campaign would be spending on advertising, but noted that it had $2.1 million in the bank at the end of August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Brooks, associate director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron, said these early waves of advertising are aimed at the candidates' strong supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``An Obama pro-choice ad (that began running last week) is not designed for the undecided voter,'' Mr. Brooks said. ``The strong pro-choice or pro-life voters have already made up their minds'' about which candidate will get their vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``That ad, in my mind, was designed to get pro-choice voters to the polls now,'' Mr. Brooks said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cleveland television market has made it into the Top 10 markets this year -- at least for presidential campaign television advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Ohio is fourth among the states for campaign spending. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the state a key battleground for the two presidential candidates, both Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., are saturating Cleveland and Ohio with television advertising, according to a University of Wisconsin-Madison analysis of campaigns ads from Sept. 6 through Sept. 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey found that the two candidates aired 1,005 ad spots in the Cleveland market -- 574 for Democrat Obama, 431 for Republican McCain. The survey did not calculate dollars spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statewide, the two campaigns spent $1.6 million during the first week after the Republican National Convention. That's more than 10% of the total TV spending of $15,571,000 by the two camps that week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top-ranked city was Denver, while the candidates spent the most money in Pennsylvania among the states during the week-long survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Where the campaigns advertise tells us a great deal about the candidates' electoral strategies,'' said Ken Goldstein, director of the Wisconsin Advertising Project. ``Campaigns only run ads in states they think they can win or where they think they can bait the other side into spending money.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wisconsin program is analyzing nearly all the political advertising that's airing by candidates for federal office and for governor and has been since 2001. It uses data compiled by TNS Media Intelligence, a New York firm that tracks advertising for advertisers and ad agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey didn't estimate the dollars spent on TV ads by market, only by state. During the survey period in Ohio, the candidates spent almost the same amount of money; the McCain campaign spent $812,000, and the Obama campaign $801,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a later look at advertising expenditures by Crain's Cleveland Business found Sen. Obama was outspending Sen. McCain in Northeast Ohio on broadcast television. For seven days during mid-September, the Obama campaign spent $294,000 versus $215,000 for McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee, according to orders placed by the campaigns in the public files the TV stations are required to keep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain orders were for Sept. 16 through Sept. 22; the Obama orders were for Sept. 15 through Sept. 21. The money was split roughly equally among WEWS-TV, Channel 5; WJW-TV, Channel 8; WKYC-TV, Channel 3, and WOIO-TV, Channel 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renee Morley, local sales manager at WOIO, said the week-to-week orders from the presidential campaigns have been higher this year than in previous presidential campaigns.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;Zero,&quot; 30-seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Producer: Obama for America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where you can see it: It's running nationally on cable TV. View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/ eyeonohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: Announcer: &quot;Number of minutes in debate: 90. Number of times John McCain mentioned the middle-class: Zero. McCain doesn't get it. Barack Obama does.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: &quot;The fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. ... And when you look at your tax policies ... you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now. I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama voice-over: &quot;I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: The ad opens with letters being typed over a black screen about McCain's failure to mention the middle class in the first presidential debate. Then it shows clips from the debate of Obama talking about the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: The spot uses the debate footage to paint McCain as out of touch with the middle class because he failed to mention it by name. Factual, yes - McCain didn't use the words &quot;middle class&quot; - but fair is another question. McCain said on ABC News' &quot;This Week&quot; that he was referring to everyday Americans during the debate when he spoke about people on Main Street struggling and paying the price for greed on Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama criticized McCain's tax policy during the debate. Both candidates favor tax cuts, but Obama's tax-reform package is generally targeted to help the middle class, while McCain favors broader tax changes that would benefit even the wealthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain favors lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, doubling personal exemptions for dependents to $7,000 and extending the Bush tax cuts for all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama favors extending the Bush tax cuts for everyone but the very wealthy, expanding the earned income tax credit for lowincome Americans, eliminating income taxes for seniors making less than $50,000 and closing business tax loopholes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laura Bischoff is a reporter for the Dayton Daily News. E-mail: lbischoff@dayton dailynews.com. McCain 'Promise' ad By Jon Craig | The Cincinnati Enquirer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;Promise,&quot; 30 seconds. Producer: McCain campaign. Where to see it: It's airing nationally. View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/ eyeonohio. Script: (Announcer): &quot;In the midst of war, Sen. Obama voted to cut off funding for our troops. What did Biden say?&quot; (Joe Biden) &quot;They said they voted against the money to make a political point.&quot; (Announcer): &quot;He added ....&quot; (Biden): &quot;This is cutting off support that will save the lives of thousands of American troops.&quot; (Announcer): &quot;Barack Obama. Playing politics. Risking lives. Not ready to lead.&quot; (McCain): &quot;I'm John McCain, and I approve this message.&quot; Video: The ad begins with dark images of troops fighting in Iraq and the words &quot;Voted to cut funding for our troops.&quot; Television sets show then-presidential candidate Biden speaking at the Iowa State Fair on Aug. 15, 2007, and on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on Sept. 9, 2007, before he was selected as Obama's Democratic running mate. The ad ends with a color image of a smiling McCain, the Republican presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: FactCheck.org called the McCain claim that Obama voted against the troops &quot;highly misleading.&quot; Obama has voted in favor of war-funding bills at least 10 times since becoming a U.S. senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using the same standard employed here, McCain has supported cutting off funding to U.S. troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's presidential campaign cites one vote that Obama cast against a funding bill to justify its claim, but that vote came after President George W. Bush vetoed a version of the bill that included a date for withdrawal from Iraq. In fact, most Republicans voted against the 2007 war-funding bill that Obama and other Democrats supported. McCain was absent for that vote, but he urged Bush to veto the bill.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS Ohio</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't blame Barack Obama and John McCain for looking over their shoulders every time they come to swing state Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're trying to outrun some unwelcome company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win the state and its 20 electoral votes, Obama must leave primary election rival Hillary Rodham Clinton behind. The New York senator was wildly popular in Ohio where her message resounded with the struggling blue-collar workers both presidential candidates must win over Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton had the strong backing of Gov. Ted Strickland, a popular Democrat who had to make a not entirely convincing about-face and embrace the Democrat he was criticizing not long ago for being too inexperienced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To beat Obama, McCain must distance himself from President Bush. With the backing of social conservatives and rural voters, Ohio gave Bush the White House in 2004. But the state has grown weary of the war, and the economy continues to limp. Strickland and other top Democrats never miss an opportunity to tag McCain with the &quot;Bush third term&quot; label.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Republican has won the presidency without taking Ohio, and only two Democrats have done so in more than a century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates have told voters what they think they want to hear, though McCain has ventured into more dangerous territory. The Republican twice took his pro-NAFTA free trade positions to town hall meetings in Youngstown, where workers battered by job losses overseas were not exactly sympathetic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates have promised to push the development of clean coal, or coal that's been scrubbed of its pollution-producing emissions. That's welcome news to those in the Appalachian coal fields. Building energy efficient cars is a must, a winning position in the Youngstown area, with its still strong General Motors plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their positions on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan resonate with two sets of Ohio veterans. Democrats and war-weary skeptics like Obama's plan for a relatively quick withdrawal. More conservative vets like McCain's refusal to set a timetable for getting out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Newton of Canfield in suburban Youngstown was a supporter of Clinton who said she didn't have any problem making the transition to backing Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has the intellectual ability just beyond question to do the job, he has the energy and enthusiasm to stick with it,&quot; said Newton, 56, who represents companies in workers' compensation cases before the state. &quot;He has a very broad ability to look at all sorts of things the military, foreign policy, domestic problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dayton resident Terri Bell, 49, cast a ballot for McCain during early voting, saying he has more experience than Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a war veteran and a POW survivor,&quot; she said. &quot;He's great. Period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio represents challenges for both candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given its recent history, the state would seem to be a shoo-in for Obama. Ohio lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs while Bush has been in office, and a GOP state corruption scandal allowed Democrats to retake top statewide offices in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Clinton beat Obama by a solid eight point margin in March, including strong showings in southern Ohio, Strickland's old stomping grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mid-September poll in Ohio suggested voters still didn't know as much about Obama as they did about McCain. With Clinton out, Ohioans also seemed less passionate about Obama. Or in some cases, they were downright hostile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cynthia Ruccia, leader of a national group of Clinton supporters defecting to McCain, lives in Columbus where she was once a stalwart of local Democratic politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's credentials with social conservatives, who helped re-elect Bush, aren't nearly as solid. During the primary, some dubbed him a &quot;rhino&quot; Republican in Name Only and voted for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, even though Romney had bowed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also lacks the fundraising machinery and grass-roots network available to a sitting governor, an advantage Bush had four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was a late comer to the importance of the state in the race, with his campaign suggesting early on that the road to the White House didn't have to go through Ohio. He has warmed to the state since. But he still hasn't embraced Ohio the way McCain has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through September, Obama had been to the state eight times. McCain paid 17 visits during the same time period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two were even in advertising, with McCain spending $812,000 for TV commercials in Ohio and Obama spending $801,000 through mid-September, according to the University of Wisconsin's Advertising Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After trailing Obama in Ohio fundraising for months, McCain gained a lead, with $3.8 million raised through Sept. 2, compared with $2.5 million for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates have used visits for major policy addresses, including Obama's support for continuing government funding of religious groups providing social services and McCain's proposal to expand school vouchers for poor children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also announced the biggest news of his campaign, and perhaps his boldest ploy, at a Dayton rally: his selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The choice of the location undoubtedly gained him extra credit in the state. Obama didn't get any help from his running mate when Joe Biden mistakenly told a woman during a handshake line that the candidates didn't support clean coal and were opposed to new coal-fired plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Palin pick didn't work for Buzz Cline, 60, who has voted for Republicans and Democrats for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Palin is George Bush in a skirt, politics wise and intelligence wise,&quot; said Cline, of Warren. &quot;I think he could have picked a better candidate. That really sealed the deal for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorothy Campbell started working at age 15, so she knows how to get a job. But at 19, the high school dropout can't find work and can't even afford the gas to get to a training program for her GED. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Food prices went up high. The gas prices are up,&quot; Campbell said. &quot;Everybody's bills are outrageous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her boyfriend, Kenny Lankford, 20, works as a bus driver, but the Dayton couple still have trouble making ends meet, a problem that worsened when they lost all their food in September's storm-related power outage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wounded economy has everybody's attention, including presidential candidates Sen. John McCain, RAriz., and Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., who both voted last week for a $700 billion bailout bill designed to resolve the financial crisis roiling from Wall Street to Main Street. But for people like Campbell, Lankford and thousands of others across the Miami Valley, the downward spiraling economy isn't about lost retirement savings, 401(k) accounts or the commercial credit crunch. It's about something much more basic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't get food stamps or nothing,&quot; said Campbell after visiting Catholic Social Services food pantry. &quot;We have to survive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every four years the presidential caravan comes to Ohio because of its up-for-grabs 20 electoral votes. But this is not the Ohio the candidates saw four years ago or four years before that. More people are struggling to pay the mortgage and put food on the table. The social services safety net is bulging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many more bad things can happen to us?&quot; asked Montgomery County Commissioner Judy Dodge after September's windstorm, newly announced state budget cuts, and the Wall Street meltdown. &quot;Every time you turn around it's bad news after bad news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic tailspin is taking a toll in measurable ways. Statewide the number of people receiving cash assistance, formerly known as welfare, was up 11.5 percent, and the number getting food stamps was up 7.5 percent in June, compared to the same month last year. Officials expect those percentages will rise once complete data is available for recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One third of the people applying for public assistance from southwest Ohio counties in the last month were either new to the system or had not received public assistance in the last five years, said Joel Potts, senior policy analyst for the Ohio Job and Family Services Directors Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not about handouts. It's about assisting each other,&quot; said Helen Jones-Kelley, director of Ohio's Department of Job and Family Services. &quot;Our problem is more and more Ohioans are having temporary challenges and it is not entirely of their making.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By JULIE CARR SMYTH, Associated Press Writer</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLITICAL NEWS</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">999 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS Ohio</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether they're picking Pampers or presidents, Ohio is the place to be. The state that gave George Bush his second term is often viewed as just the right cross section of America needed to gauge consumer and political tastes alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Got a hamburger to test market? Do it here. A new soap sud or undergarment to premiere? This is your place. A national political ad to air? We'll eat it up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio has produced many a test market-driven fast food chain and big retailer for the same reasons it is a testing ground for politicians: its mix of urban, rural and suburban regions and the blend that brings of ideas from East, South and West. Columbus attracts restaurant testers because of its high percentage of young families buying first houses and having their first children. Cincinnati's established suburbs are just right for testing retail products with the well-off professional set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, as presidential contenders John McCain and Barack Obama try to sell themselves to voters, Ohio experts on retail tastes offer a few insights into the confounding contradictions of the sought-after Midwest voter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesson One: We want fun with meaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Baba, a spokeswoman for Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s Mr. Clean, said consumers want some enjoyment from their everyday experiences. Perhaps this is why thousands of Ohioans have been flocking to political rallies this year particularly those of Obama, Sen. Hillary Clinton and, since he picked Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Car enthusiasts were telling us that cars weren't being pampered the way they wanted, it had become too much of a mechanical experience,&quot; Baba said. &quot;Their car was a personification of what they thought their identity to be, and the car wash experience wasn't meeting those needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mr. Clean Performance Car Wash features lounge areas with wireless access, flat-screen TVs and suds soakers kids could use to douse the passing cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research confirmed, however, that customers which, in Ohio, means Americans in general wanted to be part of something that was giving back to the community, perhaps raising money for the local band or partnering with schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the wildly popular political rallies, Facebook meet-ups and house parties of 2008 are any indication, voters are already having fun. Bruce Newman, a DePaul University professor and expert in political marketing, says it has been easier than ever this year for candidates to sell voters, their consumers, on the fact that their participation is meaningful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're talking about a potentially seismic change in the political landscape of the country and potentially the world if we wind up electing the first African-American presidential nominee of a major party. We're talking about the first time in 50 years that there's not been an incumbent president or vice president running for office,&quot; Newman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesson Two: We want convenience without harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the campaigns inch ever closer to the day they must get Ohioans out of their chairs and to the polls, retailers note that consumers are increasingly addicted to convenience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To meet this need, Mr. Clean car washes offered consumers a place to access wireless Internet, pick up a bouquet of flowers and grab a cup of coffee all at the same time, Baba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dublin-based Wendy's International made its food more portable and added more menu options and late-night hours for an Internet generation too rushed to sit down to a family meal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet consumers also are demanding healthier choices, both for themselves and for the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baba said Mr. Clean car washes tried to break new ground by recycling water and emitting no toxins from soaps and other chemicals. Cincinnati-based P&amp;G underestimated how much such green options would connect with consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They saw this as good for my car, good for my community and good for the environment,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In politics, Newman said, convenience without risk means making voters comfortable staying where they are, voting for the same party election after election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I call it the Disneyland concept. People want a thrill and they want it to be easy and convenient, but they want no risk attached. They don't want to go out and climb a Rocky Mountain where there's a real risk of killing yourself,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Convenience in politics basically means not having to put forth much effort to feel that emotional connection to your political party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesson Three: We want change and more of the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in general are well-traveled today,&quot; said Bob Bertini, a spokesman for fast-food company Wendy's. &quot;They're looking for different flavors, textures and tastes in their food.&quot; Wendy's jazzed up its menu, with a zesty chicken wrap and Mandarin-style salad, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, Bertini notes, Americans still want their comfortable fallbacks such as a hamburger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Boring, president of the market-watching Boulevard Strategies, said Ohio's demographics translate into midscale tastes. In other words, though it has its share of upscale shopping venues, the state loves its big box retailers and national chains, from Home Depot to Best Buy to Kroger. Wal-Mart is the state's largest employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think a lot of it has to do with familiarity,&quot; Boring said. &quot;It's easy, it doesn't require a lot of thought, and you know what to expect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A concept not so foreign to politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, isn't veteran senator Joe Biden the hamburger to Obama's zesty chicken wrap? And Palin, the first female vice presidential nominee of the GOP, the upscale boutique that accompanies the Sears Hardware familiarity of McCain?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newman said all people want both new and old at the same time, which can be a perplexing puzzle for those selling things or candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Change has been, and will always be, the most important plank in a presidential platform because, by nature, we get bored easily as people and there's a systemic drive, this curiosity, to have something new and different,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;Figured,&quot; 30 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Producer: Obama-Biden campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where to see it: It's airing in Ohio and other battleground states. View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/eyeonohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: Barack Obama: &quot;I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this message.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randy Henry (coal miner): &quot;Barack originates from Chicago. But he came to southern Illinois and seen the devastation and the loss of jobs in this coal industry. Washington, D.C., is not listening to us. Barack understands this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voice over: &quot;In Illinois and the U.S. Senate, Barack Obama helped lead the fight for clean coal, to protect our environment and save good-paying American jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randy Henry: &quot;He figured it out. It takes trust in each other to get the job done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: Opens with Obama, wearing safety glasses, shaking hands with workers in hard hats. Cuts to coal miner Randy Henry, bearded and also wearing a hard hat, with a coal mining site as the backdrop. Next, Obama's shaking hands with people apparently in Chicago. Fades back to the mine site where Henry is shown again against the mine site with &quot;Randy Henry Coal Miner, 31 Years&quot; on the screen. Next Obama is talking to a group of voters with &quot;The Obama Record $200 Million for Clean Coal&quot; on the screen. The message changes to &quot;Read Obama's Energy Plan: Barack Obama.com/issues/energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry makes a final appearance with Obama shaking hands with a voter wearing a baseball cap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: This ad should be required viewing for Joe Biden of Delaware, who sometimes seems to forget that he's Obama's running mate. In Maumee in September, Biden delighted Republicans when he declared, &quot;We're not supporting clean coal,&quot; adding, &quot;No coal plants here in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans pounced. They put out radio ads in Ohio and three other states declaring that the Obama-Biden ticket opposes &quot;clean coal.&quot; FactCheck.org has called that claim false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporting documents from the Obama campaign make clear that Obama has a long record of supporting this technology. In a coalrich state like Ohio, where much of the electricity is generated by coal and miners &quot;cling&quot; to their jobs, that's an important point. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also adds to Obama's pledge to promote energy independence, although there are doubters as to whether coal power ever really will be &quot;clean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad helps Obama in another way. Henry, the coal miner, is the kind of white, workingclass voter that Obama has been having trouble winning over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama won over lots of voters like Henry in his 2004 U.S. Senate race, and he did some of his successful wooing in southern Illinois, a region of that state that's closer culturally to Dixie than it is to Chicago and the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win the state, Obama needs to draw support from the same kind of voters in culturally conservative southern Ohio. If he ever gets around to campaigning in person there, Obama probably should bring along Henry or some other coal miner and leave Biden back in Delaware.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Hershey is a reporter for the Dayton Daily News. E-mail: whershey@DaytonDailyNews.com McCain 'Rein' ad By Jack Torry | The Columbus Dispatch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;Rein,&quot; 60 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Producer: McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where to see it: It's airing on network television stations. View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/eyeonohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: (Announcer) &quot;John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie. The Post says: McCain 'pushed for stronger regulation ... while Mr. Obama was notably silent.' But Democrats blocked the reforms. Loans soared. Then, the bubble burst. And taxpayers are on the hook for billions. Bill Clinton knows who is responsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(President Clinton): &quot;I think the responsibility that the Democrats have may rest more in resisting any efforts by Republicans in Congress, or by me when I was president, to put some standards and tighten up a little on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Announcer) &quot;You're right, Mr. President. It didn't have to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(McCain): &quot;I'm John McCain, and I approve this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: Opens with a still photograph of McCain followed by a photograph of Fannie Mae's headquarters. Then the commercial shows portions of a Washington Post editorial over another photograph of McCain, before dissolving into an unflattering photo of Obama. The commercial shows a photograph of Capitol Hill, a house that had sold, a foreclosure sign over another house and a photo of a taxpayer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the viewer sees a still photo of Bill Clinton before dissolving into Clinton during a televised interview. It concludes with a still photo of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: McCain has broken with conservatives to advocate for regulation. In 1998, he proposed that the Food and Drug Administration regulate tobacco; in 2002 he supported the Sarbanes-Oxley bill that imposed tougher accounting rules on corporations; and in 2006 he was a co-sponsor of a bill to reform regulations on mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2006, McCain warned that if &quot;Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risks that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system and the economy as a whole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress did not approve the bill, and the commercial accurately quotes a Washington Post editorial from Sept. 19, saying that Obama &quot;was notably silent'' about reforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. On Sept. 7, the federal government seized control of the mortgage giants and their $5 trillion worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where the commercial exaggerates is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not completely responsible for the financial crisis plaguing Wall Street. Many investment banks, such as Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, loaded up on mortgage securities that fell in value.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lima News, Sept. 26</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's difficult to understand just what President Bush was trying to accomplish with his televised speech Wednesday night. It's not that the content was so bad. As a partial explanation of how this crisis evolved, his speech wouldn't have been inappropriate for a sixth-grade civics class. That is perhaps what a presidential speech should be, given the attention span of too many Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Bush gave a few concrete details businesses and banks could fail and people could lose their jobs he didn't explain why this crisis would lead to that result. Nor did he come close to explaining why a monstrous $700 billion bailout would make the difference, or why this was the correct remedy rather than some other possible approach. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... It's unclear whether Bush was trying to scare us or instill confidence. Perhaps all he accomplished was to confirm the impression that this odd duck gets lamer by the hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Net: http://www.limaohio.com/articles/bush 28657   article.html/speech crisis.html</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Akron Beacon Journal, Sept. 28</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why does John McCain or Barack Obama want to be president? The question may sound silly, 19 months into the presidential campaign, six weeks before Election Day. Yet the answers remain elusive, their first presidential debate on Friday evening providing frustratingly little help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... Where does McCain or Obama want to take the economy? Why? Worth noting is that each would add substantially to the national debt, yet both pretended that isn't case. Leadership involves attracting followers. Words matter, as one candidate likes to say. To what overriding purpose would McCain or Obama deploy the presidency and rally the country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... After the debate, the McCain camp jumped to craft an ad jabbing Obama for saying many times the equivalent of &quot;John's right.&quot; Swift. Yet isn't the Obama gesture reflective of the reaching out the country could use at home and abroad?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Net: http://www.ohio.com/editorial/opinions/29855029.html</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer, Sept. 27</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's rare enough for lawmakers to put aside partisan bluster in an election year. It's even more uncommon when they vote together for over-the-horizon resource protections that their grandchildren can applaud. In fact, it's almost unheard of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why this week's lopsided congressional vote to protect Great Lakes waters for decades to come is so welcome. Sidelining a handful of naysayers and goosed by virtually the entire Ohio delegation, the U.S. House passed the Great Lakes Compact on Tuesday by a vote of 390-25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freshman Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton of Copley Township expertly handled the floor debate, with assists across the aisle from Springfield Republican David Hobson, who worked overtime to reassure fence-sitters that the measure would not intrude on private property rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... Shockingly, among the few opponents in the House were two Democratic lawmakers from Ohio Reps. Dennis Kucinich of Cleveland and Marcy Kaptur of Toledo who not only should know better, but whose constituents deserved better. Their districts include much of the Lake Erie waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... The laborious regional exercise to protect the lakes began 10 years ago when a Canadian company tried to ship Lake Superior water to Asia. Such trafficking will become virtually impossible once the president signs this compact into law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Net: http://www.cleveland.com/editorials/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/opinion/122250429315101.xml&amp;coll2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The (Youngstown) Vindicator, Sept. 27</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most people in the West, malaria is one of those diseases they only think about when an epidemic results in a death toll that grabs the headlines. Such a disconnect is not surprising given that it is in Africa and in parts of Southeast Asia where this killer has survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the number of deaths, approaching 1 million a year, demands our attention. In light of the fact that infants and toddlers are most at risk, ignorance of malaria is no excuse for doing nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the solutions seem so simple that it is almost criminal that this disease still exists. By providing better access to bed nets, indoor spraying, improved diagnosis and treatment, preventative measures for pregnant women and development of new vaccines, the number of deaths could be reduced to zero in just seven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... Nearly a quarter billion people get malaria each year, according to a WHO report last week. That figure halved an earlier estimate of 500 million, based on improved measurement techniques. WHO left unchanged its latest figure for malaria deaths: 881,000 people killed by malaria in 2006, most of them children under 5.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAIRBORN - At least 50 people who gathered at Wright State University Friday night, Sept. 26, to watch the first presidential debate were at times transfixed and at other times full of laughter, especially when one candidate would display a facial expression while taking in the response of his foe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gathering in Oelman Hall featured a huge projection screen and a voter registration drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 90-minute debate was commercial free. Students who had to leave for comfort breaks hurried back so as not to miss exchanges between Republican Sen. John McCain and Democrat Sen. Barack Obama in Mississippi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aaron Botts, 24, a communications major, said the debate was rough and tumble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were being tough with each other and taking real jabs,&quot; he said. &quot;They're both showing great confidence. They're neck-and-neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Galina Nikolskaya, a 25-year-old medical student originally from Moscow who has been in this country nine years, will be eligible to vote for the first time Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is a little more articulate,&quot; she said. &quot;McCain is using history, and it takes him five years to get to the point. And when he does, you forget the question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her friend, Zebo Zakir, also a medical student originally from the former Soviet Union, said she felt Obama scored more points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate, she said, &quot;is not providing all the answers. But they are revealing some of the values they have and what's important to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thinking process of Obama is easier to understand. I can follow the logic.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eye on Ohio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A look at the candidates' media campaigns in the Buckeye state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;Ohio Jobs,&quot; 30-seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Producer: McCain-Palin campaign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where to see it: Ohio television stations and DaytonDailyNews.com/ eyeonohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: Announcer: &quot;Ohio's small businesses create more than half of all our jobs. John McCain and his Congressional allies will help them create even more. With tax cuts to create jobs. Investments in renewable energy to revitalize Ohio's manufacturing. Reforms to make health insurance affordable. And job retraining to help workers stay competitive. Change is coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain: &quot;I'm John McCain and I approve this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: To zippy, upbeat music, viewers see shots of people working, cutting to a picture of McCain juxtaposed next to a picture of the U.S. Capitol. The screen cuts to shots of more people working, a shot of windmills, people working in medical jobs and at a computer, suggesting retraining. The ad ends with a black screen reading, &quot;Change is Coming,&quot; then a shot of McCain smiling in front of a flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: Change? Wasn't that Barack Obama's mantra?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ad works to assuage Ohioans who might vote for Obama because of their concerns about the economy that McCain is their guy. Obama has hit McCain with some success on economic issues in the state, which currently suffers from a 7.4 percent unemployment rate, higher than the national average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign has reminded voters of McCain's admission that economics is &quot;not something I've understood as well as I should&quot; and have jumped on recent McCain comments that the fundamentals of the economy are strong to paint him as out of touch. To be fair, McCain's comments were taken out of context - he was arguing that while the economy is weak, America's workers remain strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain uses fundamental Republican points - that easing the tax burdens on businesses helps to spur job development - to argue that he has a plan to help Ohio's struggling economy. McCain would phase out the alternative minimum tax and double the personal exemption for dependents, among other proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also, like Obama, has a plan to invest in renewable energy to revitalize Ohio's manufacturing, though differences exist on specifics. And he uses this ad to say he'd work to improve the cost of health care, including making insurance more portable. He also offers a job retraining program aimed at displaced workers. That plan includes special assistance for older workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is also aimed at convincing voters that, though many of the current economic struggles occurred during the Bush administration, McCain is no George W. Bush. When he says &quot;Change is Coming,&quot; he's also refuting the Democratic mantra that a vote for McCain would be a vote for a third Bush term.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Producer: Barack Obama campaign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where to see it: National cable and in key battleground states. Dayton Daily News.com/ eyeonohio </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: Lilly Ledbetter: &quot;I worked at this plant for 20 years before I learned the truth. I'd been paid 40 percent less than men doing the same work. John McCain opposed a law to give women equal pay for equal work. And he dismissed the wage gap saying women just need education and training. I had the same skills as the men at my plant. My family needed that money. On the economy, it's John McCain who needs an education.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama: &quot;I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: Opens with archival shots of the Goodyear plant and Lilly Ledbetter. Cuts to shots of Lilly Ledbetter addressing the camera. Cuts then to a brown screen saying &quot;John McCain opposed a law to give women equal pay for equal work, then saying &quot;John McCain dismissed the wage gap ... saying women just need 'education and training.' &quot; Cuts back to Lilly Ledbetter speaking to the camera, then ends on a shot of Sens. Barack Obama and Joe Biden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: Obama has made the push for women voters even before he beat Sen. Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary earlier this year. This ad makes the argument that if elected, he'd be better than McCain for women, particularly on the issue of pay equality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ad uses Lilly Ledbetter, an Alabama woman who fought at the Supreme Court level for pay equality, to make the case that he'd work for equal pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She cites an April 23, 2008 Associated Press story by Libby Quaid reporting that McCain opposed a Senate bill seeking equal pay for women because it would lead to more lawsuits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that same story, however, McCain is quoted as saying, &quot;I am all in favor of pay equity for women, but this kind of legislation, as is typical of what's being proposed by my friends on the other side of the aisle, opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems ... This is government playing a much, much greater role in the business of a private enterprise system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That bill was named for Ledbetter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the National Organization for Women, in 2005, women's median annual earnings were only 77 cents for every $1 earned by men. The gap is even more stark for women of color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an analysis of Obama's own U.S. Senate office by Scripps Howard News Service columnist Deroy Murdock finds the Illinois senator falls short as an employer: While Obama's average male employee earns an average of $54,397, Murdock found, his average female employee earned $45,152 on average. Among Obama's five best-paid staff, only one was a woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, meanwhile, paid his male staffers an average of $53,936. His female staffers averaged $55,878. Of McCain's top-five best paid staffers, three were women.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two largely unknown candidates for Ohio attorney general used the national financial crisis and a trendy TV ad Thursday to bring attention to their important but overlooked race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio's role as a swing state in the U.S. presidential contest has overshadowed the race between Democratic state Treasurer Richard Cordray and former U.S. Attorney Mike Crites, a Republican. Both seek to replace former Attorney General Marc Dann, a Democrat who resigned in May amid a sexual harassment scandal involving top aides in his office. He also admitted to an extramarital affair with an employee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just 40 days until the election, the race has begun to intensify. Cordray announced a plan Thursday to crack down on credit card marketing on college campuses, expanding on his efforts to protect financial consumers as state treasurer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crites' first ad as the underdog in the race plays off the Dann scandal. Patterned after Apple Inc.'s &quot;I'm a Mac&quot; ads, it features a hip, young guy telling a rumpled-looking voter that Cordray is a professional politician and that he fits the mold of Dann, who made his name as a consumer advocate and whose career is now compared to the disgraced former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crites campaign spokesman Mark Weaver defended the campaign's decision to make its first ad negative, saying they would later air biographical material on Crites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because this race was framed by the incompetence and corruption of the Marc Dann scandal and because of Richard Cordray's support and advocacy of Marc Dann, it's important to frame the race in that way,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leesa Brown, a spokeswoman for the Cordray campaign, called the Crites ad a political cliche.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's typical of the silly season: a cookie-cutter ad that makes empty claims,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Ted Strickland and other powerful Democrats, including Cordray, led the charge to oust Dann after Democrats took control of four of five statewide offices in 2006 on a promise to end Republican corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Rogers, on leave as dean of the Ohio State University law school, was appointed by Strickland to fill the job as attorney general until the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race so far has received scant attention outside Columbus, despite a few heated exchanges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crites has questioned what he considers to be an unusually active and costly public relations staff working for Cordray at the state treasurer's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cordray has responded by suggesting that Crites had been sitting on the sidelines of public service for 15 years while Cordray was serving as a county and state elected official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crites points out that he served during that time in the U.S. Navy and Navy Reserves, including time as a unit commander, as well as sitting on a local school board and serving as a city law director and prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates are largely unknown to voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Quinnipiac University poll in August found three-quarters of Ohioans knew too little about Cordray to form an opinion and even fewer had heard of Crites. Independent candidate Robert Owens, an attorney in nearby Delaware County, was not included. A poll by The Columbus Dispatch found 42 percent of Ohioans still undecided late last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio's statewide officeholders are usually elected in the middle of four-year presidential terms, a set up most states have in place to keep big races for state offices such as governor or attorney general from clashing with presidential politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ohio, the timing required by Dann's resignation barely two years into his first term is particularly unfortunate for the attorney general candidates. With 20 electoral votes at stake, the state has been a favorite stumping ground for Republican presidential nominee John McCain, Democratic nominee Barack Obama and their surrogates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates and their running mates have made more than 20 stops in the state just this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans had initially been optimistic that the Dann scandal gave them a prime opportunity to regain one of the offices they lost in 2006. In that year, the GOP controlled all five statewide offices, both chambers of the state Legislature and the Ohio Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Cordray's clean record as treasurer and simultaneous connections to two offices treasurer and attorney general targeted by generous campaign donors has made it an uphill climb for Crites, despite his credentials and party backing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of last month, Cordray had $2.2 million in the bank compared to Crites' $75,000. Owens' campaign was in the hole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weaver said he expects Cordray to outspend Crites 3-to-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cordray's credit card plan calls for working with lawmakers to combat excessive marketing of credit cards to college students, uniting higher education officials in efforts to curb the practice, and, as attorney general, taking legal action against entities that prey on students who can't afford the debt options they're offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Financial and economic security is the driving problem that I hear about all over the state, much more than anything else far more, even, than the war in Iraq,&quot; Cordray said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS - Former Dayton-area Congressman Tony Hall will endorse fellow Democrat Barack Obama for president in an ad to be aired on Ohio Christian radio stations starting Monday, Sept. 22. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a Democrat endorsing another Democrat is not unusual, Hall's action is part of a broader effort by Democrats this year to draw support from religious voters who have been crucial to Republicans' success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans would have us all believe that if you're not a Republican, you can't know God,&quot; Hall, who made fighting hunger in the U.S. and globally the focus of his congressional career, said in a telephone interview on Saturday, Sept. 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He served in the U.S. House from 1979-2002 before being appointed by Republican President Bush as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations' Agencies for Food and Agriculture, based in Rome. He served as ambassador for more than three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hall made the ad for the Matthew 25 Network, a political action committee organized &quot;to mobilize Catholic, Evangelical and diverse Christian voices for a new Christian witness in politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group takes its name after the chapter from the Gospel of Matthew in which Jesus instructs his followers to care for the &quot;least of these.&quot; The ad is aimed at connecting this Christian mandate to the economic crisis in Ohio and the country, a press release said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hall called Obama a &quot;good man&quot; committed to helping the poor and cited Obama's decision after law school to work on a voter registration driver rather than take a high-paying job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ad, Hall identifies himself as a &quot;pro-life Democrat,&quot; which puts him at odds with Obama, who supports abortion rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this disagreement, &quot;I believe he would be the best person to work on the things I care about,&quot; Hall said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McClelland, spokesman for the Ohio Republican Party, said that the &quot;conservative Christian vote is just as complex as any other voting bloc.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're going to look at where the candidates stand on a number of issues and we're confident they'll support Sen. (John) McCain,&quot; McClelland said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden on Thursday called Republican John McCain's answers to the current economic crisis &quot;the ultimate bridge to nowhere&quot; and said paying higher taxes would be patriotic for wealthier Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, McCain said raising taxes in this economic climate is &quot;just plain dumb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden said the GOP presidential nominee was out of touch with average people's problems, comments designed to resonate with voters in economically troubled northeast Ohio and keep pressure on McCain during a week of bad news from U.S. markets and financial institutions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden's two-day bus trip in the region included stops in areas devastated by thousands of job losses in manufacturing and the auto industry. With the economy a top concern in Ohio, polls were tight in this essential swing state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's answers for the economy and we're in such desperate shape is the ultimate bridge to nowhere,&quot; Biden told an audience of 2,500 on a turf field outside the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reference to the infamous Alaska project dubbed &quot;the Bridge to Nowhere&quot; was a dig at McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who supported building the bridge until Congress moved to kill it as an example of wasteful spending. She has since claimed she stopped the project a nearly $400 million structure designed to link a southeastern Alaska town to its airport on a nearby island and told Congress &quot;thanks, but no thanks&quot; when, in fact, the state diverted the money to other projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview on ABC's &quot;Good Morning America,&quot; Biden said wealthier taxpayers would indeed pay more under the proposals of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. Under his plan, people earning more than $250,000 a year would pay more in taxes while those earning less the vast majority of taxpayers would receive a tax cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to take money and put it back in the pocket of middle-class people,&quot; Biden said. Of those who would pay more, he said: &quot;It's time to be patriotic ... time to jump in, time to be part of the deal, time to help get America out of the rut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain misstated Biden's remark when he told supporters at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that Biden had said &quot;raising taxes is patriotic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Raising taxes in a tough economy isn't patriotic. It's not a badge of honor. It's just plain dumb,&quot; McCain said. &quot;The billions in tax increases that Sen. Obama is proposing would kill even more jobs during tough economic times. I'm not going to let that happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin piled on, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden said it again today, raising taxes is about patriotism,&quot; she said in Cedar Rapids, where she appeared with McCain. &quot;To the rest of America, that's not patriotism. Raising taxes is about killing jobs and hurting small businesses and making things worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden responded during remarks to about 150 people at a Laborers' International Union of North America Local 894 in Akron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tell me how everybody is better off? The point I want to make is, and I mean this sincerely, wealthy people are just as patriotic as poor people. We just have not asked anything of them,&quot; Biden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although McCain claims Obama would raise taxes, the independent Tax Policy Center and other groups conclude that four out of five U.S. households would receive tax cuts under Obama's proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new TV ad that repeats widely debunked claims about the Democratic tax plan, McCain's campaign charges that Obama would increase the federal government amid an economic crisis. Contending that &quot;a big government casts a big shadow on us all,&quot; the ad features the image of a shadow slowly covering a sleeping baby as a narrator misstates the reach of the Obama tax proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden ended the Ohio bus tour with a rally Thursday night in downtown Youngstown. He spoke to about 1,200 people from a small outdoor stage facing aging buildings, some with boarded up windows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This country deserves more than a brave soldier. It needs a wise leader,&quot; Biden said. &quot;John is profoundly out of touch, profoundly out of touch with where the American people are.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain, an abortion rights opponent with a conservative Senate record on the issue, seems content with the public's perception that he's more moderate on the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama, who supports abortion rights, is only too happy to remind voters where McCain stands, but he tries to make his case without attracting too much attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both presidential candidates are gingerly trying to strike the right chord on abortion as they reach out to a critical voting group independents and moderates, primarily women in swing-voting suburban regions of crucial states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates' carefully targeted ads on abortion and stem-cell research, topics that enflame passions among both abortion-rights proponents and opponents, illustrate how Republicans and Democrats alike are tailoring their messages to specific groups of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama criticizes McCain in ads that say the GOP nominee takes an &quot;extreme position on choice&quot; and &quot;will make abortion illegal.&quot; That misrepresents McCain's position. The Arizona senator favors overturning the Supreme Court's guarantee of abortion rights but would let states decide their own abortion laws, and he is not seeking a constitutional ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is using low-profile radio ads and campaign mailings to make his point about McCain. He hopes to avoid being tagged as too liberal on abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, for his part, is responding with radio commercials promising to support stem cell research to &quot;unlock the mystery of cancer, diabetes, heart disease.&quot; He doesn't mention that he supports embryonic stem cell research, which many anti-abortion Republicans oppose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cultural issues have largely taken a back seat in this campaign to the frail economy and the Iraq war, as well as questions of character and promises of change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the race close, each candidate is trying to woo voters concerned about particular issues in hopes they will help tip the balance on Nov. 4. As with abortion, the candidates are likely to use radio and campaign mail on other social topics, such as gun control and gay rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent groups also are getting into the act with TV ads. One is trying to make Obama look out of the mainstream even among abortion rights supporters by casting him as far left. Another is encouraging McCain to &quot;embrace a pro-life agenda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Democratic presidential nominees Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, Obama has not shied away from using abortion to reach out to independents and moderate Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats say President Bush's Supreme Court selections of conservatives John Roberts and Samuel Alito gave Obama an opening to press the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women are more worried now about the future of the court than in either of the last two election cycles, and Obama has been tapping into that and making this issue a big difference between him and McCain,&quot; said Democratic analyst Jenny Backus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans say Obama doesn't understand that people generally are more conservative than liberal and tend not to be single-issue voters on abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the Obama people to try to make McCain into this passionate pro-lifer, it doesn't make any sense,&quot; said Rich Galen, a Republican operative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's radio ad, running in Indiana, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and elsewhere, features nurse practitioner Valerie Baron telling voters: &quot;John McCain's out of touch with women today. McCain wants to take away our right to choose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glossy fliers with the same messages fill the mailboxes of women in Florida, Virginia and other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countering that effort, McCain rolled out his own radio ad suggesting he's not as far right on abortion as Obama makes him seem though he never mentions that procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, McCain's&nbsp;commercial focused on stem cell research and said he will invest more money in research to prevent disease and find medical breakthroughs to &quot;help free families from the fear and devastation of illness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Obama, McCain backs relaxing federal restrictions on financing of embryonic stem cell research while running mate Sarah Palin along with many conservatives in the GOP opposes that method because human embryos are destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain opposes abortion rights except when the life of the mother is in danger and, unlike Palin, in cases of rape or incest. He has voted for abortion restrictions permissible under Roe v. Wade and has said the 1973 decision that guaranteed abortion rights should be overturned, leaving states to decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and his running mate Joe Biden favor federal money for embryonic stem cell research and largely agree on abortion. But Biden was among a minority of Democrats in voting several times in favor of banning the procedure that opponents call partial birth abortion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the weather cools off, the arts scene heats up and the sounds in the air start changing from marching bands and concerts on the lawn to the new fall TV theme songs, music for new movie trailers and annoying video-game bleeps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're limbering ourselves up for new versions of &quot;Rock Band&quot; and &quot;Guitar Hero,&quot; getting our friends tuned up for mega-battles and embarrassing displays of pseudo-musicianship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's autumn folks, and we're rearranging the symphony seating for the best place to watch the fall lineup, making decisions on where our earmarked technology money will be spent: New Apple stuff or a shot at &quot;Spore?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's all building to the crescendo that is holiday buying. Music, television, movies, technology, books ... there's choices a-plenty here for anybody looking for something - anything - to do. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's time to come in, everybody. As the weather grows nippy, and the outdoor concert season draws to a close, we all, regardless of age, have to come inside for our popular music entertainment. And there are plenty of concert offerings, regardless of one's age, on the horizon this new season. Some highlights, by age demographic: For the young ones: Disney's Cheetah Girls go on tour this fall, with stops Nov. 23 at US Bank Arena in Cincinnati and Nov. 28 at Nationwide Arena in Columbus. For the teens: Industrial metal fans will be thrilled by the Nine Inch Nails concert, Nov. 17, at the Jerome Schottenstein Center in Columbus, while hip-hoppers will be interested in Bow Wow's Oct. 26 show at Lifestyle Communities Pavilion, also in Columbus. For college students: Keller Williams, Sept. 17, at Seven Timbers Live on Webster Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For boomers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carole King, Sept. 22, at the Schuster Center in downtown Dayton; or the Steve Miller Band, Nov. 15, at Nationwide Arena in Columbus. For the hip of all ages: Michael Buble, Oct. 7, at Wright State University's Nutter Center.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weird. That's the only word to describe the fall TV season, which is the biggest casualty of the 100-day writers strike. TV executives often talk about wanting to shake up the way they do business. And TV critics and viewers often wish networks wouldn't load each fall season with more new programs than any sane person can absorb. This year, both wishes were granted. Thanks to the strike, which began in November, fewer new shows were made for fall. We're getting remakes of foreign shows (&quot;Eleventh Hour,&quot; &quot;Kath &amp; Kim,&quot; &quot;Life on Mars&quot;), remakes of old shows (&quot;90210,&quot; &quot;Knight Rider&quot;) and remakes of classic literature (&quot;Crusoe&quot; and &quot;My Own Worst Enemy,&quot; a Jekyll and Hyde tale). Even the most high-profile offering, J.J. Abrams' &quot;Fringe,&quot; seems, at first glance, to be an amalgamation of ideas from shows such as &quot;X-Files&quot; and &quot;Twilight Zone.&quot; Is it time for the broadcast networks, which have given us this buzz-free fall, to exit stage left? Should they cede the tube to more adventurous cable networks? That's what Mark Harris argues in a provocative recent piece in Portfolio (tinyurl.com/portfolioharris). By surrendering to the relentless niche-ification that the digital age has brought, cable networks, which identify and pursue specific slices of the TV audience, are operating at an advantage, Harris argues. &quot;Broadcast networks want everyone,&quot; Harris writes. &quot;And the business of wanting everyone has never been worse.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plan the memorial service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for the broadcast networks, I have three</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">words for Harris: The &quot;Lost&quot; pilot. What cable network would hav e spent more than $10 million on that, as ABC did. Perhaps &quot;Lost's&quot; success is an anomaly, but that was one attempt to woo &quot;everyone&quot; that worked out OK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much as it pains me (the memory of &quot;Viva Laughlin&quot; lingers), I come not to bury the broadcast networks, but to praise the. Cable is indeed having a well-deserved moment in the sun - the returns of &quot;The Shield&quot; on FX and &quot;Dexter&quot; on Showtime are the most anticipated September events in my house. But the game is more fun when all teams are giving their best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As long as the broadcast networks are around, they're going to b giving people money to make TV shows. Many resulting programs will be bad, but every year there are gems. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is there a treasure to be found in this year's muddled mixture? That remains to be seen. Stay tuned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When itcomes to commercial Hollywood movies, autumn is a no-man's land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fine with us. Fall is a great season for foreign, independent and documentary films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a welcome time for moviegoers who've had their fill of comic book flicks, teen comedies and nonthrilling thrillers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are a few of the more intriguing titles expected to spice up this fall's art house scene. In most cases there's no opening da te set yet ... the operators of art house theaters hate to be pinned down when they might want to hang on to a film that's doing good business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Milk&quot;: Gus Van Sant (&quot;Drugstore Cowboy,&quot; &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;) directs Sean Penn as Harvey Milk, California's first openly gay elected official. Milk became a city supervisor in San Francisco and a cultural touchstone before being assassinatd (along with Mayor George Moscone) by an emotionally unhinged (or was it just homophobic?) colleague. With Josh Brolin, Emile Hirsch, James Franco, Diego Luna and Victor Garber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Girls Rock!&quot;: Already this year we've seen &quot;Young Heart,&quot; th sleeper doc about octogenarians singing rock 'n' roll. &quot;Girls Rock!&quot; focuses on a group of real-life 7-year-olds participating in the Rock 'n' Roll Camp for Girls in Portland, Ore. The advance buzz says it's less about music than about girls exploring an environment in which it's OK to be yourself, to be loud and to make mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Blindness&quot;: &quot;Constant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gardener&quot; director Fernando Meirelles delivers an allegory about one woman (Julianne Moore) who keeps her sight when the rest of the world goes blind. With Mark Ruffalo, Gael Garcia Bernal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Flow: For Love of Water&quot;: The next big battle won't be over oil. It'll be about water, according to Irena Salina's documentary about the world's water supply. Around the globe good old H2O is being privatized; this film reveals corporate water piracy, the complicity of governments, the burden put on the poor and the scam of bottled water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Christmas Tale&quot;: Mortality, madness, buried sexual secrets and maybe a ghost ... sounds like a holiday treat to us! The latest from director Arnaud Desplechin (he's considered the next big thing in French cinema) stars Catherine Deneuve, Mathieu Amalric, Chiara Mastroianni and Hippolyte Girardot as members of a dysfunctional family gathered for a yuletide reunion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot;: &quot;Adaptation&quot; scribe Charlie Kaufman makes the leap to directing with this weird (what else could it be?) comedy about a stage director (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who hopes to win back his estranged wife (Catherine Keener) by re-creating New York City in a warehouse and populating it with thousands of actors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Filth and Wisdom&quot;: Madonna (yes, that Madonna) makes her directing debut in this yarn about the inhabitants of a rundown London apartment building. It's cast mostly with unknowns but offers at least one familiar face: that of Richard E. Grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trumbo&quot;: Blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo - who ran afoul of Congress' search for Hollywood communists in the early '50s - is the subject of Peter Askin's documentary, featuring readings from Trumbo's extensive correspondence. Providing voices or their own recollections are Joan Allen, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Kirk Douglas, Danny Glover, David Strathairn and Donald Sutherland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're all still talking about the latest salvo launched in the browser wars, that being Google's Chrome, released in beta format a few weeks ago. Count on tweaks and tightening as the Google-folk perfect the browser they're convinced will take down Firefox and Internet Explorer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on our radar is Dell's itty-bitty laptop release, a 2.3-pound computer that starts at $350 and will fit in a big purse. Still, we're always waiting for news on what Apple's been up to, and it looks as if they're still perfecting the already-perfect iPod, with MacBook updates to come later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All will be forgotten, however, when &quot;Guitar Hero: World Tour&quot; and &quot;Rock Band 2&quot; enter our homes, taking over our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">brains and free time, unless we've already given it over to &quot;Spore,&quot; the long-anticipated game by &quot;Sims&quot; creator Will Wright, which carries with it what appears to be a daunting learning curve (players control life ranging from primordial gloop to space exploration).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOOKS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Hillel Italie Associated Press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Election years are supposedly off years for books, when we're all too busy following the news. Author-filmmakeractivist Michael Moore thinks we should even take a break from reading any of the fall releases, including his own, and get out there and work for our favorite (progressive) candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But publishers and booksellers are betting - and praying - that a combination of topical works, escapist tales and a very long look at the business of being a billionaire will lure us from the screen, TV or computer, and back to the printed page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moore's new book, &quot;Mike's Election Guide 2008,&quot; is already a best-seller on Amazon.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A look at five major releases for fall:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The War Within: A Secret White House History 2006-2008,&quot; Bob Woodward (Simon &amp; Schuster): The fourth of Woodward's chronicles of the Bush administration has been billed as the hottest inside Washington document since the Pentagon Papers. It should certainly be the political book of the fall, even if it isn't about presidential nominees Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hot, Flat and Crowded,&quot; Thomas Friedman (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux): The influential New York Times columnist and author of the million-selling &quot;The World Is Flat&quot; calls for the United States to lead a &quot;Code Green&quot; environmental revolution. &quot;America's problem is that it has lost its way in recent years,&quot; he writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brisingr,&quot; Christopher Paolini (Alfred A. Knopf): The third of Paolini's million-selling &quot;Inheritance&quot; fantasy series will get a Harry Potter-style midnight launch, although it's doubtful the book will have Harry Potter-style sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life,&quot; Alice Schroeder (Bantam): Nearly 1,000 pages, Schroeder's authorized biography promises a deep and unprecedented look into the world of the press-shy billionaire investor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Hour I First Believed,&quot; Wally Lamb (HarperCollins): Booksellers are excited about the first novel in a decade from the author of &quot;She's Come Undone.&quot; Lamb's new novel, more than 700 pages, is centered on two teachers at Columbine High School, in suburban Colorado, during the 1999 shootings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Producer: McCain campaign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where to see it: In key markets in Ohio and other crucial states and online at DaytonDailyNews.com/eyeonohio </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: (Announcer) &quot;Education Week says Obama 'hasn't made a significant mark on education.' That he's 'elusive' on accountability. A 'staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's one accomplishment? Legislation to teach 'comprehensive sex education' to kindergartners. Learning about sex before learning to read?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama. Wrong on education. Wrong for your family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(John McCain): I'm John McCain and I approved this message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: As childlike music plays in the background, a series of unflattering photos of Barack Obama appear over black and white school scenes such as lockers, a classroom of empty desks and school buses. When the announcer says &quot;learning about sex before learning to read,&quot; young children sitting at an art table come into focus in the background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: This is a misleading attempt to scare families away from Obama. Parts of it are flat-out wrong. It claims that Obama's one accomplishment for education is passing legislation to teach comprehensive sex education to Illinois kindergartners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 14-page bill passed out of committee in 2003 but never became law. The bill indicated &quot;age appropriate&quot; sex education based on medically accurate information should be taught in kindergarten through high school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first page mandated that pupils whose parents objected not be required to take any sex-ed, and it required school districts to emphasize abstinence as an effective means of preventing unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill did not hand down curriculum to school districts mandating that kindergartners learn about sex before learning to read. When Obama's opponent tried to use this against him in his 2004 U.S. Senate race, Obama stressed that it was meant to protect young children from sexual predators by teaching them about good touch versus bad touch and give them basic information such as storks don't bring babies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no curriculum out there - from a comprehensive sex-education standpoint or from an abstinence-only point of view - that teaches kindergartners to have sex. It doesn't exist,&quot; said Earl Pike, director of the AIDS Taskforce of Greater Cleveland, which advocates for comprehensive sex-education programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Bill Burton said, &quot;It is shameful and downright perverse for the McCain campaign to use a bill that was written to protect young children from sexual predators as a recycled and discredited political attack against a father of two young girls.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If, as seems to be the case, the presidential candidates and their mates - running and otherwise - are going to be in Ohio every other day for the next two months, the question will keep arising: are they worth going to see?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Depends on what you're looking for. If it's information about the issues of the day and the candidates - which is what a lot of people say they are looking for - you can find search mechanisms that are more time-efficient. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who saw Sarah Palin at the Nutter Center a couple of weeks ago or in Lebanon Tuesday heard her say this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I told Congress 'Thanks but no thanks,' for that Bridge to Nowhere up in Alaska. If our state wanted a bridge, we would build it ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's information of a sort, if you consider a crock to be information. C-SPAN has been showing a debate from 2006, when she was running for governor. Everybody can see her saying she was for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are, in fact, lots of other quotes from her to that effect. Maybe she had mixed feelings along the way, even before that. But her effective opposition came only after the idea was publicly discredited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest crock is that business about &quot;build it ourselves.&quot; No state is more dependent on federal money for public projects. Alaska is notorious for its success at getting money from Washington. Always has been. Still is, on her watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might also have heard her say by now that Barack Obama has never authored major legislation in Washington or Illinois. In fact, he has done that in both places. And surely you've heard about the state plane she sold on eBay. Truth is, it didn't sell on eBay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Misinformation is flying around all over the place these days. Some of it has been detrimental to Palin; so now a lot of people don't know what to believe about her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've always had a few guidelines about judging truth and honesty in campaigns:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Don't believe anything the first several times you hear it if it sounds like something one side would dearly want to believe and the other would hate to believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Don't believe anything that comes from partisans until you've heard it confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Don't believe, about political ads, that the candidates couldn't say something if it weren't true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* And now, of course, don't believe anything you've only seen on the Internet (except maybe YouTube).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Don't hold anything against a candidate until he or she has said it multiple times; allow for self-correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Don't be too quick to judge candidates by what some of their supporters are saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* One more: If you really care, if you are really into this stuff, go to factcheck.org. The people there research the charges flying around from a nonpartisan perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site makes mistakes, of course. And it makes judgments that one is free to disagree with; it picks some nits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it has the resources - including the smarts - to really delve. And it'll give you its findings in any level of detail you want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The McCain campaign is now citing factcheck.org in an ad that denounces some slurs against Palin. But factcheck.org is mad, because the ad suggests the site criticizes the Obama campaign, whereas, in fact, the slurs come from elsewhere.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Factcheck puts to rest the line from the Republicans about Barack Obama being the most liberal member of the Senate. And the one about him saying Iran is tiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the site notes that Barack Obama does not, as he insisted in Denver, offset his tax cut fully &quot;by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens.&quot; He raises some taxes. Indeed, his total tax package is an increase in revenues (though a cut for most people).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he is not fair to John McCain when he says McCain says $5 million a year is the middle-class cutoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when Obama says that McCain would tax your health benefits, he ignores a McCain tax credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want to believe that one side is pure, there are plenty of other sites.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain's presidential campaign released a new television ad Tuesday that says Democratic rival Barack Obama is bad for families because he supports sex education for kindergarteners. Obama's campaign called the ad a &quot;shameful&quot; distortion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, which will run in Ohio and elsewhere, says Obama has a weak record on education and that his only accomplishment was legislation to teach sex education to kindergarteners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Learning about sex before learning to read?&quot; the ad says. &quot;Barack Obama. Wrong on education. Wrong for your family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the legislation was not Obama's, it never became law and it would have required age-appropriate information in schools. Obama has said that means warning young children about sexual predators and explaining concepts like &quot;good touch and bad touch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is shameful and downright perverse for the McCain campaign to use a bill that was written to protect young children from sexual predators as a recycled and discredited political attack against a father of two young girls,&quot; Obama spokesman Bill Burton said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton noted that in a recent interview with Time magazine, McCain refused to define 'honor.' &quot;Now we know why,&quot; Burton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers said: &quot;The Obama campaign has not disputed any of the facts in our ad, but if they want to question John McCain's honor and record of service to this country, then that's a debate we welcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign released the ad hours after Obama gave a speech on education and offered proposals normally more popular with Republicans. Obama promised to double funding for charter schools, pay teachers based on performance and replace those who aren't up to the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a state senator in Illinois, Obama voted for the sex education bill in committee in 2003, but he was not a sponsor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measure said schools offering sex education must include medically accurate information appropriate to the age of the students. The lessons were to cover the consequences of unprotected sex, the effects of various forms of contraception and the option of abstinence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also would have allowed parents to pull their children from sex education classes if they wished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full state Senate never voted on the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following year when Obama ran for the U.S. Senate, Republican Alan Keyes tried to make an issue of the sex-education vote, but it never gained traction with Illinois voters. Obama defended the idea of giving kindergarten pupils some basic information that babies aren't brought by a stork, for instance but said those decisions should be left to local school officials and parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's&nbsp;ad is to air in parts of Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Missouri and Wisconsin, as well as on the Discovery channel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama promised Tuesday to double funding for charter schools, pay teachers based on performance and replace those who aren't up to the job, embracing education proposals normally more popular with Republican candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic presidential nominee says both parties must work together to improve education in a pitch to independent voters in this presidential election swing state, where the fight over education reform has been the focus of a longtime partisan battle. It was the first of two days that Obama was spending on education policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days after Republican candidate John McCain talked up the idea of school choice at the GOP convention, Obama proposed to give parents more options, too but not with a federal voucher program to pay for private schools, something McCain has supported. Instead, Obama seeks to create an array of new public schools. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite McCain's rhetoric, he is not proposing a federal voucher plan. Instead, he is proposing only to expand the voucher program in Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal government spends about $200 million a year on charter schools, independently run institutions that receive public money. Obama's proposal would take that up to over $400 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama recognized that charter schools have been a source of debate in Ohio. Past Republican administrations used charter schools and private school vouchers to offer families a way out of troubled public schools. But Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland has been trying to scale back voucher programs to focus taxpayer money on more traditional public schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ohio Federation of Teachers has complained about the management of some charter schools, which has moved money away from the schools where its members work. The union has asked the Internal Revenue Service to investigate for-profit charter school operator White Hat Management for allegedly violating the terms of the tax-free status assigned to some of its schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll work with all our nation's governors to hold all our charter schools accountable,&quot; Obama told an audience that included many educators and members of teachers unions. &quot;Charter schools that are successful will get the support they need to grow. And charters that aren't will get shut down. I want experimentation, but I also want accountability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While teachers unions typically oppose the idea of performance-based merit pay, Obama is embracing the idea along with demands that teachers who don't meet standards are removed from the classroom. Obama's campaign said teacher performance could be judged by peer review, student test results, classroom evaluations or other processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the things we'll have to do, and this is something that I know sometimes is difficult, is teachers who are doing a poor job, they've got to get extra support,&quot; Obama said. &quot;But if they don't improve, then they have be replaced. Because as good teachers are the first to tell you, if we're going to attract the best teachers to the profession, we can't settle for schools filled with teachers that aren't up to the job. That is something that we have to embrace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also is proposing a new $500 million matching fund for technology in the classroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time he called for an end to partisan bickering over education, Obama accused Republican rival John McCain of failing to do anything to improve the quality of public education during nearly three decades in Washington. &quot;Not one real proposal or law or initiative. Nothing,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new Obama television ad contends that the Arizona Republican voted to cut education funding and voted against accountability standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the day, McCain's campaign rolled out a fresh television ad that says Obama's only education accomplishment is legislation to teach 'comprehensive sex education' to kindergartners.&quot; The ad raises the question &quot;learning about sex before learning to read?&quot; and calls Obama &quot;wrong for your family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign called the ad &quot;shameful and downright perverse.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WEST CHESTER, Ohio (AP) On her way in for some quick shopping at the Target store, Kim Benz paused to consider this year's presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm totally confused,&quot; she acknowledged. &quot;Normally, I'm ready to vote Republican right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benz, 40, a married mother of three daughters, lives in Mason, part of a swath of small cities, bedroom communities and exurbs in three southwest Ohio counties that form a crescent over Cincinnati. Fields planted in corn and soybeans a couple of decades ago are now grown over with shopping centers, casual dining chain restaurants and subdivisions, and you find many of their residents at high school football games on Friday night, soccer fields on Saturday morning and in church pews on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Butler, Warren and Clermont counties were rock solid in 2004 for President Bush, voting for him by more than 2-to-1 and delivering a 130,000-plus margin in the swing state where Bush clinched re-election by fewer than 119,000 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are fissures in the GOP base here, with the election two months away and polls indicating Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama are in a tight race in a state that no Republican has reached the White House without winning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some voters remain skeptical about McCain's conservative credentials, and he faces what a political analyst calls &quot;an enthusiasm gap.&quot; Evangelical Christian political activists in the past have felt he hasn't taken strong enough positions on issues such as gay marriage and abortion, and some were alarmed when he suggested he would consider a running mate supportive of abortion rights, even though he isn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has courted the region's conservatives during campaign visits this summer, and his choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for his ticket drew enthusiastic reactions from some activists here. Former U.S. Rep. Rob Portman says he sees McCain picking up key supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Benz, McCain has a big advantage over Obama in experience, but she's concerned about his age 72 which becomes more significant because he would have a first-term governor as his vice president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm kind of questioning his choice,&quot; Benz said. She's watching as more information unfolds about Palin; she approves of Palin's strong anti-abortion position and doesn't think her unmarried daughter's pregnancy should be a political issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, she wonders about Palin's ability to take over for McCain if that became necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the area's best-known elected officials, Butler County Sheriff Richard Jones, isn't ready to commit to McCain, for different reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, I'm staying on the sidelines,&quot; said Jones, a Republican. He said his conservative constituents admire McCain as a war hero, but that won't necessarily mean a big turnout. &quot;There's just no enthusiasm for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When McCain visited his county last month, Jones took out a half-page newspaper ad asking about his immigration plan. Immigrants are a small but visibly fast-growing segment of the area, and Jones has concentrated on battling illegal immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cites McCain's 2006 support in the Senate for a comprehensive immigration bill that included a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants; Jones said he opposes any measure that grants what he says is amnesty for breaking the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain now says he would secure the borders first; Jones wants to hear all the details of his immigration plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evangelicals are a major political force in this area, and that's a group McCain has had trouble exciting, said John Green, director of the University of Akron's Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain has not been as strongly supported by evangelicals at this point in the campaign compared to the kind of support George Bush had in 2004,&quot; Green said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that as in 2004, Ohio '08 is shaping up as a tight election in which every geographic region or voting bloc is potentially crucial. Initial reactions indicate Palin could help close McCain's enthusiasm gap with Christian conservatives, Green said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jane Maines of Hamilton was a strong supporter of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, whose candidacy for the GOP nomination was popular among evangelical Christians in this area. She and her daughter, another Huckabee supporter, attended the Dayton rally in which McCain introduced Palin as his running mate, and they were pleased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel like we now have a conservative to vote for,&quot; said Maines. &quot;It could be a larger turnout than we thought.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She thinks Palin also could help attract swing voters and some women who supported Hillary Rodham Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jami White, 20, a University of Cincinnati student who works at a restaurant near her Butler County home, hasn't decided who will get her first presidential vote. She was intrigued by the Palin choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It might be kind of cool to see a woman for vice president,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darlene Gill of West Chester said she wasn't surprised that McCain chose a female running mate and thought it was a smart move. She made up her mind for McCain long ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish we could all vote now and get it over with,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign recently opened an office in Middletown, in Butler County, and state campaign spokesman Tom Reynolds said it will be active in the area, including on college campuses and in seeking votes from &quot;a lot of disenfranchised Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not conceding any part of the state,&quot; Reynolds said. &quot;Even though these are staunch GOP counties, we feel we can pick up some supporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain backer and former Bush administration official Portman, whose southern Ohio House district included Clermont County and part of Warren, said McCain is gaining momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he's doing well generally in the state and specifically in southwest Ohio,&quot; Portman said. &quot;I do think it's going to be close, and I have always thought that Ohio would be close again ... We're a classic swing state.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh yeah, Barack Obama and John McCain will tell you all about the messages they endorse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I endorse this message,&quot; they will say when Dr. Phil and Judge Judy take commercial breaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other candidates will roll out their endorsements slowly, interrupting your enjoyment of &quot;Will and Grace&quot; and &quot;Everyone Loves Raymond.&quot; I would never do that. Never! Setting your television free will be my first act as president. So to get you to love me even faster, I am going to pull off the Band-Aid brand bandage and tell you all about the message I endorse right now. I am an open book, you see. And the embossed pages of my book are full of opulence and intrigue. Nothing to hide here, friend of friend. Oh no, I am not an underground dance club. I am not a red-light camera. Unlike my opponents, I am a giving giver and a giver who gives. So here in a nutshell are the sort of the messages I endorse:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Grape juice is darn delicious, but it is no orange juice. Would you trust a grape to teach your child trigonometry at 3 a.m.? Re-elect orange juice!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Stacked-heel oxfords - sure they are excellent sources of energy, but can they REALLY reduce our dependence on foreign oil? I question that premise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Sen. Barack Obama's campaign is aggressively fighting an ad airing in Ohio that seeks to tie the Democratic presidential nominee with a former domestic terrorist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Dayton, WHIO-Channel 7, WKEF-Channel 22, Fox 45 and WDTN-Channel 2 are airing the ad.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 60-second spot, released last week by a 501(c) 4 group acting independently of Republican John McCain's presidential campaign, criticizes Obama for his relationship with William Ayers, a Chicago law professor who decades ago was affiliated with the Weather Underground, a radical organization that bombed the U.S. Capitol in 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total ad buy nationally - the ad is also running in Virginia, Michigan and Pennsylvania - is $2.9 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its release, Obama's campaign has fought it vigorously, first quietly airing its own ad to counteract the attack, and also threatening legal action. The campaign argues that because a founder of the American Issues Project, Ed Failor Jr., previously worked for McCain's campaign, McCain is ultimately behind the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact John McCain dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so-called independent committee shows how desperate he is to change the subject from his shocking disconnect with the economic struggles of the American people,&quot; said Tommy Vietor, an Obama spokesman. &quot;He knows that Barack Obama has denounced the detestable crimes that Bill Ayers committed 40 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is being financed through a donation by Texas billionaire Harold Simmons, a fundraiser for McCain's campaign who helped finance the 2004 &quot;Swift Boaters for Truth&quot; campaign that hurt then-Democratic nominee John Kerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why would Barack Obama be friends with somebody who bombed the Capitol and is proud of it?&quot; the script reads. &quot;Do you know enough to elect Barack Obama?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was never a member of the Weather Underground and was nine years old when the Capitol was bombed in 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers and his wife have contributed small amounts of money to Obama's campaign, but Obama has said they are not close, though they serve on a Chicago board together.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cincinnati Enquirer, The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Columbus Dispatch and the Dayton Daily News present Eye on Ohio A look at the candidates' media campaigns in the Buckeye state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;3 a.m.,&quot; 30 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Producer: McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where to see it: It's airing in battleground states, including Ohio, and in Denver during the Democratic National Convention. View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/eyeonohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: Narrator from Hillary Clinton ad that aired in the primary: &quot;It's 3 a.m. and your children are safe and asleep. Who do you want answering the phone?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcer: &quot;Uncertainty. Dangerous aggression. Rogue nations. Radicalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton: &quot;I know Sen. McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House. And, Sen. Obama has a speech he gave in 2002.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcer: &quot;Hillary's right. John McCain for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: &quot;I'm John McCain, and I approved this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: The ad opens with footage from arguably Sen. Hillary Clinton's most controversial - and maybe most effective - ad from the primary. A mother cracks the door to a dark bedroom of a sleeping child. The voiceover asks, &quot;Who do you want answering the phone,&quot; an unsubtle suggestion that Clinton is prepared to be president and Barack Obama is not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The footage then shows tanks barreling over windswept ground, a missile being launched and hooded jihadists on the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next, it's back to Clinton saying Obama's claim to fame is a single speech. Pay close attention and you'll see Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland in the frame to Clinton's left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After showing type saying &quot;Hillary's right,&quot; there's a flattering portrait of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: The McCain campaign is mining and milking Clinton's criticism of Obama during the primary for all it's worth. This is at least its third ad featuring Clinton since Obama announced Saturday, Aug. 23, that he had chosen Sen. Joe Biden to be his running mate. In the previous ads, he's said Obama passed over Clinton for VP because she told the truth about him; in another, a former Clinton delegate declares she's switched to backing McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ad began airing Tuesday, Aug. 26, the second day of the Democratic Convention and the day that Clinton was making her speech appealing for party unity. It's the McCain campaign's reminder that no matter what Clinton is saying now, once upon a time - and not long ago - her criticism of Obama was scathing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Ted Strickland, a prominent former backer of Hillary Rodham Clinton, has an unwelcome cameo in a new ad bashing Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's typical of the rough-and-tumble campaign heating up as Democrats, including Strickland, gather in Denver for their national convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strickland, the first Democratic governor elected in Ohio in 20 years, spoke at the convention late Tuesday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His speech followed the release of the &quot;3 a.m.&quot; ad by the campaign of Republican rival John McCain that uses one of Clinton's own primary ads to attack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original &quot;3 a.m.&quot; ad featured a telephone ringing early in the morning to pose the question to voters who they would want to answer it. The implication was Obama had far less experience than Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ad lifts the opening images from the original ad, including the sound of the ringing telephone. It moves on to pictures of tanks, a rocket lifting off and masked men marching with guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Uncertainty,&quot; an ominous voice says, accompanying the images. &quot;Dangerous aggression. Rogue nations. Radicalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These pictures are followed by footage of Clinton giving a speech during the primary. &quot;I know Senator McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the kicker: &quot;And, Senator Obama has a speech he gave in 2002.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Clinton speaks, Strickland leans briefly into the picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad ends with the announcer saying: &quot;Hillary's right. John McCain for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strickland was one of Clinton's most prominent supporters during the primary. He's credited with helping guide her to an eight-point thumping of Obama in Ohio's March primary by urging her to adopt a statewide campaign rather than focus on heavily Democratic urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strickland also campaigned for Clinton in Indiana, Iowa and Kentucky. He repeatedly said Obama was less experienced than Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Strickland on Wednesday night said he was confident his campaigning for Clinton wouldn't hurt Obama in Ohio in November. He also laughed off his brief inclusion in the McCain&nbsp;ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Quite frankly, I don't care what John McCain does with his ads,&quot; he said from the Democratic National Convention. &quot;I think what he's doing is a little silly and trite. Apparently, he doesn't understand that there's an economic crisis evolving in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strickland has said voters don't care whether he switches gears from supporting one candidate to another. People are much more interested in health care, education and ending the war so troops to come home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are doing everything they can to exploit tension between former Clinton backers and Obama supporters during the Democratic convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee's Denver &quot;war room&quot; on Monday presented a trio of Clinton supporters and a former Democratic congressman, each of whom is supporting McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They included Cynthia Ruccia, a longtime Democratic activist and strong Clinton supporter from Columbus who helped start an organization to oppose Obama. She says she is voting for McCain despite her Democratic background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton supporters are independent voters who want to understand the reasoning of speakers like Strickland and others, said Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO turned McCain adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People will be looking to understand the rationale, besides party loyalty and party unity what is the specific rationale behind his support of Barack Obama,&quot; Fiorina said of Strickland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strickland said he's confident Democrats will leave Denver as a unified party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton demonstrated that the well-being of the country is more important to her than her own political success,&quot; he said, referring to her Tuesday speech to the convention. &quot;The choice right now is between more of George Bush policies and a change in direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAMPAIGN NOTEBOOK:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama and running mate Joseph Biden plan to head to Cleveland after the convention to attend the Saturday funeral of U.S. Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones. Tubbs Jones, a Democrat who was the first black woman to represent Ohio in Congress, died Aug. 20 after suffering a brain hemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Quinnipiac University poll conducted from Aug. 17-24 shows Obama and McCain in a dead heat in Ohio. Of 1,234 likely voters surveyed, Obama had 44 percent compared to 43 percent for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The McCain campaign this week tapped U.S. Rep. Bob Latta, a Bowling Green Republican, as a co-chair of Ohio Sportsmen for McCain, a gun rights group.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DHL article lacked substance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pathetically shallow Aug. 9 Dayton Daily News story (&quot;Obama&nbsp;ad criticizes McCain's handling of 2003 DHL deal&quot;) was woefully lacking in substance. Very little was said about the major role three top-level John McCain staffers, including his campaign manager, Rick Davis, played in putting 8,000-plus Ohio jobs on the chopping block. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These three staffers made money lobbying for a foreign-owned company, Deutsche Post, to be allowed via its DHL to take over Airborne Express, which has resulted in this fiasco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then, to add insult to injury, the &quot;Straight Talk Express&quot; comes to Ohio proclaiming Barack Obama a &quot;job killer.&quot; The article barely addresses these facts, but devoted two paragraphs to quoting a McCain spokeswoman from Wilmington saying how &quot;shameful and horrible&quot; Obama is for using this to &quot;promote himself,&quot; and praising McCain for admitting that he may not be able to help. Huh?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does anyone else see the hypocrisy here? Doesn't the DDN have an obligation to inform readers about major considerations such as these, especially when thousands of local people are being impacted?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know there is only so much space to work with in a newspaper, but the article above this story was all about a woman who chaperones at the Chaminade-Julienne prom and designs clothing to enter in the Ohio State Fair, topped off with a big picture of her ironing (&quot;Prom chaperone wields a needle of propriety&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm embarrassed for our city, state and, mostly, for the Dayton Daily News.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where's the 'straight talk'?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much for &quot;straight talk&quot; from John McCain. I was appalled to learn that McCain's campaign manager was a key player in the 2003 business deal that led to the loss of 8,000 jobs at DHL. In these critical times for working American families, we need to elect a leader who refuses to take lobbyist money, not one whose campaign is run by lobbyists. Barack Obama has proven that he understands what this country needs, shares our values and will set the right priorities to keep jobs where they belong - in America.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">681 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dayton will apparently be John McCain's Springfield, Ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to new reports, the Republican vice presidential pick will be officially unveiled at a McCain rally at the Nutter Center on Friday, Aug. 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The obvious interpretation of this plan is that Sen. McCain is focused on winning what might be the most important swing region (that is, one that might go for either party) in what might be the most important swing state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Montgomery County itself has gone slightly Democratic in the last four presidential elections, the rally won't be in Montgomery County, but just outside. When the whole Miami Valley is counted, Republican presidential candidates do win. But the point, some might say, is that all these calculations are close. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most likely, though, the selection of Wright State's Nutter Center is not simply about winning votes in this region. Other regions have more voters who are up for grabs. (What characterizes swing areas is not unusual numbers of independents, but roughly equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best reason for Sen. McCain to come to a swing area is the symbolism. The trip dramatizes the McCain claim to be reaching out to the political center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The George W. Bush election plan in 2004, under strategist Karl Rove, was to maximize turnout among Republicans, that is, to energize conservatives. The McCain campaign is focusing more on independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's apparent in his television ad moniker - &quot;the original maverick&quot; - and in his selection of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a moderate, as keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention, and in Sen. McCain's public insistence that he has not ruled out as a running mate everybody who favors abortion rights. Sen. McCain's passion for Ohio has survived a lot. On an earlier trip to the state, he was embarrassed by talk-show guy Bill Cunningham's egregious attacks on Sen. Barack Obama. Sen. McCain had to denounce the attack, thus throwing salt in the wounds of the party's staunchest conservatives. Later he had to denounce a prominent central Ohio preacher, a big name in Republican circles, for the pastor's denunciations of Islam. (Given how nasty the presidential campaign has become since then, it's reasonable to wonder if Sen. McCain would still denounce the same attacks. His first response to a new book that rehashes all the old attacks and goes further was to laugh it off, saying people need a sense of humor.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cunningham event was an embarrassment to the McCain Ohio campaign, which is publicly fronted by former U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, with help from House Speaker Jon Husted. But getting the Nutter event - directly in DeWine territory - suggests the Ohio team has been rehabilitated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does scheduling the announcement for Ohio suggest an Ohioan will be on the ticket? Most attention has focused on former Rep. Rob Portman, of Cincinnati, who has held two Cabinet-level positions. Lately, however, people have been saying that Mr. Portman's connections with unpopular George W. Bush are too strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that's the criterion, then a lot of people are ruled out, including, presumably, Pennsylvania's Tom Ridge, the former director of Homeland Security, who has been on the public short lists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is worth watching for Ohioans is not so much what political bullets are dodged at the Nutter, but what connection the vice presidential pick has with values of this swing state. Will the selection be a bow to the conservative - mainly southern and western - wing of the party, or somebody closer to the political center, somebody who knows about the issues that are important to metropolitan areas?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unveiling rally at the Nutter seems likely to have more impact than most on local votes. It would get more attention that most, be discussed more and remembered more. It would give Dayton the kind of national visibility for a day that Springfield, Ill., got over the weekend, which some would appreciate. The rally has to be considered - in advance, at least - a boost to Sen. McCain's chances in Ohio, a challenge to the Democrats to go beyond the norm in pursuit of Ohio.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Jessica Wehrman | Dayton Daily News</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">439 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;Out of Touch,&quot; 30 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Producer: Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where to see it: It's airing on national cable stations. View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/ eyeonohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: Barack Obama: &quot;I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this message.&quot; Male Announcer: &quot;Call it country-club economics. How many houses does he own? &quot;John McCain says he can't even remember anymore. Well, it's seven. No wonder McCain just said the fundamentals of our economy are strong and anyone making less than $5 million a year is middle-class. &quot;Maybe McCain thinks this economy is working for folks like him. But how are things going for you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: The spot opens with a shot of Barack Obama speaking to a smiling elderly woman, then fades to black. It opens again with a shot of McCain riding in a golf cart being driven by the elder former President George Bush. It then cuts to a shot of McCain with the script, &quot;McCain unsure how many houses he owns.&quot; Cut then to a black screen that reads, &quot;John McCain has seven houses.&quot; Next up is a shot of McCain meeting with President George W. Bush. The screen below features a quote from McCain proclaiming that the fundamentals of our economy are &quot;strong.&quot; Then it's back to a shot of McCain and the elder Bush in the golf course. It concludes with footage of what appears to be an ordinary couple sitting on their front stoop. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: This is the second ad that Obama's campaign has put out jumping on McCain's inability to say how many houses he owns. The previous ad, like this one, aims to paint McCain as an out-of-touch elitist - a criticism McCain's campaign and the Republicans have also leveled at Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also seeks to hit McCain on the economy, arguably the most important issue in the 2008 elections. By painting McCain as out-of-touch with the problems of most Americans, Obama's campaign is trying to depict McCain as unable to grapple with the harsh economic realities many Americans face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad's use of the word &quot;anymore&quot; is also notable, because it again gets in the subtle dig that McCain may not know how many houses he owns because of his age. McCain will be 72 next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also seeks to link McCain with George W. Bush, a president who has consistently polled low in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is reminiscent of Republican Ronald Reagan's plaintive question that helped him win the election in 1980: Are you better off than you were four (or, in this case, eight) years ago? Obama's campaign, with this ad, wants to emphasize that McCain - and the Republican Party - aren't aware that many voters aren't better off.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Democrats and Republicans both like Sen. Barack Obama's vice presidential pick, Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats like his experience. Republicans like that Biden criticized Obama as inexperienced earlier in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, a Republican who is leading Sen. John McCain's Ohio campaign, pointed to comments Biden made during the Democratic primary questioning Obama's experience. McCain's campaign leapt on those comments Saturday morning, Aug. 23, quickly sending out a commercial emphasizing those comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the Obama campaign has a problem,&quot; DeWine said, saying Biden's comments are &quot;rather embarrassing for the campaign.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio GOP Deputy Chairman Kevin DeWine said, &quot;The selection of Joe Biden is a blatant admission that Barack Obama lacks the experience to be commander in chief. Just a few months ago Sen. Biden told Barack Obama the presidency is not the place for on the job training. He's right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats, however, are praising Biden's credentials - 36 years in the U.S. Senate and ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Ohio Democratic Chairman Chris Redfern called Biden a &quot;great choice&quot; to be Obama's running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a compelling choice because of his vast knowledge of domestic and foreign affairs,&quot; Redfern said as he arrived at the Curtis Hotel in Denver where the Ohio delegation is staying for the Democratic National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohioans should expect to see lots of Biden on the campaign trail, said Redfern, a state representative from Catawba Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montgomery County Democratic Party chair Mark Owens approves of Obama's pick for a running mate, he said Saturday, Aug. 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's experienced, he's good on foreign affairs, he's good on domestic affairs - he's what he was looking for,&quot; Owens said. &quot;He complements Sen. Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owens said Biden's workingclass background will attract Ohioans who may have initially preferred Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., as the Democratic nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you look at Sen. Biden's background, he's from a working class background, he worked his way up, he's a strong family guy,&quot; he said. &quot;He's the kind of guy Ohioans respect and like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Clayton Luckie, DDayton, said, &quot;He was one of my top choices&quot; and added that Biden's foreign policy credentials will help seal up concerns about Obama's foreign policy experience. He predicted a &quot;humungous&quot; bump in the polls as a result of Obama's pick. &quot;This is going to be such a positive thing - it's going to bump Sen. Obama so far that McCain will never catch up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Tom Roberts, DDayton, said, &quot;I think it's an excellent, excellent selection. I think he rounds the ticket. He brings the experience, the foreign affairs experience. I think (Biden) will be well thought of and well respected as vice president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Duncan, chair of the political science department at the University of Dayton, said Biden's working-class credentials would help attract some of the Democrats who had initially preferred Hillary Clinton over Obama. He also cited Biden's experience as a plus for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a good solid pick for him,&quot; Duncan said. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;Seven,&quot; 30-seconds. Producer: Obama campaign. Where to see it: It's airing on national cable stations. View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/ eyeonohio. Script: Barack Obama: &quot;I'm Barack Obama.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I approve this message.&quot; Male announcer: &quot;Maybe you're struggling just to pay the mortgage on your home. But recently, John McCain said, &quot;The fundamentals of our economy are strong.&quot; Hmmm. Then again, that same day, when asked how many houses he owns, McCain lost track. He couldn't remember. Well, it's seven. Seven houses. And here's one house America can't afford to let John McCain into.&quot; Video: Starts with a shot of Obama speaking to a smiling older woman. Fades to black. Then the video features shots of a child, wearing a bike helmet walking into a middleclass brick house, leaving her bike in the front yard. It cuts then to McCain meeting with President Bush, then a shot of a house with a foreclosure sign, featuring McCain's quote about the strong economy. It cuts then to a shot of McCain, with the screen reading &quot;How many houses does McCain have?&quot; The ad then shows script saying, &quot;McCain unsure how many houses he owns.&quot; The quote is attributed to Politico. It then cuts to a black screen reading &quot;Seven. Worth 13 million dollars.&quot; It closes with a shot of the White House. The script at the bottom of the screen reads, &quot;John McCain. We can't afford more of the same.&quot; Analysis: So much for a new brand of politics. Since McCain fumbled an answer to a question about his real-estate holdings, McCain and Obama have gone back and forth about the issue in increasingly nasty fashion. The ad is based on a question posed by Politico reporters Aug. 20. Asked about his real-estate holdings, McCain came up short. &quot;I think - I'll have my staff get to you,&quot; he told reporters. He was apparently confused about how many condominiums he owned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His staff later told Politico that there are at least four - in Arizona, California and Virginia. Newsweek estimated this summer that the McCains own at least seven properties. The commercial cites tax records from those three states in determining the cost of their property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, McCain shot back quickly by attacking Obama's pad, a three-story Chicago house with a wine cellar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans sent out a press release accusing Obama of paying $300,000 less than the asking price for his mansion while convicted political fundraiser Tony Rezko paid full price for a vacant lot next door on the same day. Rezko later sold part of that land to Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign also pointed out that one of McCain's homes during his lifetime was a prisoner of war camp in Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad makes a few personal digs at McCain. By running an ad emphasizing his inability to answer what appears to be a simple question, it implies that he's too old to remember things such as property. McCain will be 72 later this month.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A conservative nonprofit group with a past link to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign wants to spend $2.8 million on an ad questioning Democrat Barack Obama's relationship to a founder of the 1960s radical group Weather Underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, which is expected to begin airing Thursday in Michigan and Friday in Ohio, focuses on William Ayers, whose Weatherman organization took credit for a series of bombings, including nonfatal explosions at the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol four decades ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Issues Project, the sponsor of the ad, is a nonprofit 501(c)4 organization. One of its board members, Ed Failor Jr., was a paid consultant for McCain's campaign in Iowa last year. The campaign paid his firm $50,000 until July 2007. American Issues Project spokesman Christian Pinkston said Failor has no connection to the McCain campaign now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad signals the emergence of the type of tough advertising by independent organizations that operate outside the financial limits of campaign finance law. It is reminiscent of the Swift Boat ads aired against John Kerry four years ago questioning his military service and are widely blamed by Democrats for contributing to his defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers sought to air the ad on Fox News Channel, but a Fox spokesman said the network declined to run it. He would not say why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers is now a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He and Obama live in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood and served together on the board of the Woods Fund, a Chicago-based charity that develops community groups to help the poor. Obama left the board in December 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also was the first chairman of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, a school reform group of which Ayers was a founder. Ayers also held a meet-the-candidate event at his home for Obama when Obama first ran for office in the mid-1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is friends with Ayers, defending him as, quote, 'Respectable' and 'Mainstream,'&quot; the ad states. &quot;Obama's political career was launched in Ayers' home. And the two served together on a left-wing board. Why would Barack Obama be friends with someone who bombed the Capitol and is proud of it? Do you know enough to elect Barack Obama?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign accused McCain of having a hand in the ad, saying he &quot;dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so-called 'independent' committee.&quot; Federal Election Commission records show the last payment from McCain's campaign to Failor's consulting firm, Targeted Consulting, was July 2, 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Instead of invoking Paris, Britney and obscure sixties radicals, Sen. McCain should take the day off at one of his seven homes to consider whether his support for outsourcing, tax breaks for companies who ship jobs overseas and continued spending of $10 billion a month in Iraq is really putting 'country first,'&quot; Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has distanced himself from the radical activity of the Weather Underground. In an interview with &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; in April, Obama said he &quot;deplored&quot; Ayers' actions in the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Ayers is a 60-plus-year-old individual who lives in my neighborhood, who did something that I deplore 40 years ago when I was 6 or 7 years old,&quot; Obama said then. &quot;By the time I met him, he is a professor of education at the University of Illinois. We served on a board together that had Republicans, bankers, lawyers, focused on education.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the University of Illinois refused to release records relating to Obama's service on the Chicago Annenberg Exchange. The university said the donor of the records that document the charity's work has not yet turned over ownership rights to the material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The university said it is &quot;aggressively pursuing&quot; an agreement with the donor and will open the collection to the public as soon as one is finalized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign has said the senator does not have control over these records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is the first for the American Issues Project. As a nonprofit organization, the group can raise unlimited amounts of contributions, unlike political action committees that are governed by campaign finance laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinkston, the group's spokesman, said it will identify contributions used to pay for the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain in the past has criticized independent groups, even those that support him, that air negative campaign ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Failor, who is executive vice president of Iowans for Tax Relief, said: &quot;When the American public fully understands the close, continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist, we believe it will send a chill down their spines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers was a fugitive for years with his wife, fellow radical Bernadine Dohrn. But after surrendering in 1980, the charges against Ayers were dropped because of prosecutorial misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern got so caught up in his partisan role last spring that he found himself publicly expressing the hope that his state would not have a major primary, because that could hurt the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party headquarters' job is not governing. Not passing legislation. It's preparing for the next election, and the next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the hyperpartisan mindset leads to certain overstatements, well, there's the McCain defense. Asked about an egregious anti-Barack Obama book, and, on a separate occasion, about some of his own negative ads, Sen. John McCain suggested that people need to keep a sense of humor about these things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin DeWine offered the italicized critique of the governor upon the revelation last week that Ohio's unemployment rate has reached numbers unheard of during this hard decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A press release coming out of party headquarters began, &quot;Gov. Ted Strickland's jobless rate reached its highest level in 15 years last month, hitting 7.2 percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humor, apparently. Not just anybody could keep a straight face while blaming a governor of 19 months for a state's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DeWine is the state representative from Beavercreek, Fairborn and Xenia (and a cousin of the betterknown Mike DeWine). He is term-limited at the end of this year. The step he choose in furtherance of his career was a job at party HQ. He's No. 2, slated for No. 1. He's become the most visible spokesman. And the hit man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's no easy task when one's own party has lost the recent elections, when partisanship itself is in disrepute, and when the governor is skillfully fostering a nonpartisan image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years ago, DeWine's main role was as the No. 2 Republican in the House, behind Speaker Jon Husted. He showed both partisan and nonpartisan sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Husted is working strikingly well with the same governor whom DeWine is making a living trashing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strickland and Husted worked out a spending program they call an &quot;economic stimulus&quot; package. They say it focuses on projects well-suited to turning Ohio's economy in a modern direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Husted must surely be happy that Strickland is not messing with the CAT (commercial activity tax) and other aspects of the &quot;tax reform&quot; passage that the Republican legislature and governor enacted at the end of the previous governorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Husted is on board for Strickland's reorganization of the state's higher education system (as an economic development initiative).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, of course, there was the famous unanimously passed budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties still have differences, of course. The big one is over who should win the next set of elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For somebody in DeWine's position, it's one thing for individual Republican legislators to get along with the governor. If they want to seek re-election on grounds of bipartisanship, fine. A hard line coming out of party HQ doesn't undermine them. If anything, it helps them distinguish themselves from the more partisan bad guys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a party chairman does have to face these questions: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if we come to the next election (and, after all, they happen every two years, not four), and we haven't made a case against the governor? What if everybody is getting along famously, and everybody is just being nice? How do we make the case for change and more Republicans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, meanwhile, how do we keep our base giving money to our party?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer is humor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You put out the stuff that the most partisan people in the world see as the gospel truth, and you present it to the rest of the world with the unspoken plea, &quot;Hey, do you have a sense of humor or don't you?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Like it or not, DHL has become a political hot potato in the race for the presidency, with letters, ads and rhetoric flying so freely, you'd think we were talking about perennial, national campaign issues like Social Security or health care instead of a proposal that could cost upwards of 8,000 jobs in southwest Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the proposal by the German-owned company to hire rival UPS to carry its domestic air freight has become a potent campaign issue speaks both to Ohio's power as a swing state, but also to the symbolism of a small Ohio city wracked with the worry of even more job loss. For Ohio, this election is largely about the economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain and Barack Obama know this. That's why we've seen both presidential candidates meet with DHL employees or Wilmington residents affected by the proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's also why we've seen Democrats positively leap on reports that McCain and his campaign manager, Rick Davis, were the forces that helped push a Senate deal that allowed DHL's parent company, Deutsche Post World Net, to buy a U.S. air company and enter Wilmington in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's also why we've seen two ads by Obama's campaign - one radio, one on television - in the week since McCain met with DHL workers in Wilmington. The Ohio Democratic Party has also weighed in, with its own Web ad critical of McCain's role in bringing DHL to the United States, and the AFL-CIO sent out a mailer on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, meanwhile, has argued that Obama is trying to use the issue to his political benefit. Of course he would. The candidate who convinces Ohio that he can fix their economy may be the candidate who holds the key to winning the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain also disputes, justifiably, the Democrats' argument that he is at least partially to blame for the proposal and the possible loss of more than 8,000 jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he did fight an amendment that would have blocked DHL's location in Wilmington, McCain said he opposed that amendment because it was a special project inserted into an unrelated bill, not because he wanted to help DHL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And truthfully, even if he had opposed the amendment to help DHL, he'd be hardpressed to know that the ultimate result would be DHL yanking jobs from Wilmington and crippling the town's economy in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both rhetoric and correspondence have been heavy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few weeks before McCain's visit to Wilmington, Obama sent a letter to a White House staffer in charge of the DHL issue, urging the White House to look askance at this proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, meanwhile, sent two letters of his own last week. The first, to Sens. Herbert Kohl, D-Wisc., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the respective chairman and ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, urged the men to hold an antitrust subcommittee hearing on the proposal. Hearings in the House are set for September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second, co-signed by U.S. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Centerville, urged Frank Appel, chairman and CEO of Deutsche Post World Net to visit Wilmington. Follow this</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;Taxman,&quot; 30-seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where to see it: It recently began airing in battleground states, including Ohio. View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/eyeonohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Producer: McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: Narrator: &quot;Celebrity? Yes. Ready to lead? No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's new taxes could break your family budget. The press warns the 'taxman cometh.' Obama's taxes mean 'higher prices at the pump.' Obama's taxes a 'recipe for economic disaster.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Higher taxes. Higher gas prices. Economic disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the real Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: &quot;I'm John McCain, and I approved this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: The ad opens with footage of Obama before a huge crowd and camera flashes while people chant his name. It cuts to video of a family with two young children and a stack of bills on the table, a worried-looking white couple standing at a window, and a young couple. Each scene has ominous quotes from newspaper editorials along the bottom of the screen. Then it goes to a smiling Obama and flashes, &quot;Higher Taxes,&quot; &quot;Higher Gas Prices,&quot; &quot;Economic Disaster.&quot; It ends with a photo of McCain, with softer lighting and music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: Once again, the McCain campaign is branding Obama as a celebrity and a tax-hiker. Viewers are hit over the head with the suggestion that Obama lacks substance and that he is dangerous. The narrator warns that Obama's new taxes could break your family budget, but leaves out the part that the families most likely to see tax increases under Obama would be making more than $250,000 a year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Obama and McCain offer starkly different approaches to tax policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has proposed extending the Bush tax cuts for all but the wealthiest Americans, and he wants to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, expand the child-care tax credit and eliminate taxes for senior citizens making less than $50,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's tax policy calls for cutting taxes for all income groups, extending the Bush tax breaks for everyone, including the wealthy, and chopping corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 25 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the &quot;Taxman&quot; ad was unveiled, the Obama campaign responded that Obama will cut taxes for the middle-class, while McCain will give new tax breaks to big business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson Browne doesn't want John McCain running on anything fueled by his lyrics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The singer-songwriter sued McCain and the Ohio and national Republican committees in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday, accusing them of using his song &quot;Running on Empty&quot; without his permission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawsuit claims the song's use was an infringement of his copyright and will lead people to conclude he endorses McCain. The suit says Browne is a lifelong liberal who is as well-known for his music as for being &quot;an advocate for social and environmental justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertisement mocks Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's contention that if U.S. drivers got regular tuneups and drove on properly inflated tires, they could save the same amount of oil that would be gained by offshore drilling. According to the suit, &quot;Running on Empty&quot; plays in the background of the ad criticizing the remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Bennett, chairman of the Ohio party, said the ad was pulled when Browne objected. He called the lawsuit a &quot;big to-do about nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Brian Rogers disavowed the ad, saying it wasn't a product of the Republican presidential candidate's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browne's lawsuit contends the Ohio Republican party released the ad on behalf of McCain and the RNC. The RNC did not return a phone call seeking comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suit notes that other musicians, including ABBA and John Cougar Mellencamp, have asked McCain to stop using their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browne's attorney, Lawrence Iser, called the ad's use of the song &quot;reprehensible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 59-year-old singer claims his reputation has already been damaged and is seeking more than $75,000 in damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browne released &quot;Running on Empty&quot; the song and an album by the same name in 1977. According to the lawsuit, the album has sold more than 7 million copies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browne's financial success has aided Democratic candidates over the years. Campaign finance records show he contributed $2,300 to Obama's presidential campaign last year and $2,000 to the Illinois senator's campaign coffers in 2004.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where to see it: It begins airing today on national cable stations. View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/eyeonohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script (male announcer): &quot;For decades, he's been Washington's biggest celebrity. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as Washington embraced him, John McCain hugged right back. The lobbyists - running his low-road campaign. The money - billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies, but almost nothing for families like yours. Lurching to the right, then the left, the old Washington dance, whatever it takes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain. A Washington celebrity playing the same old Washington game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: There are lots of shots of McCain with President George W. Bush. They hug, affectionately butt heads, and Bush even kisses McCain on the head. There's also video of McCain with Letterman, Leno and on &quot;The View&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; McCain is shown with lobbyists - at least that's how the Obama campaign identifies them - and aides and in front of an oil rig.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: This is an Obama-strikes-back ad. You called me a celebrity? I'll call you one. Take that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his earlier ad, McCain used video of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears to cast Obama as a well-spoken, but unprepared, empty suit. The Obama&nbsp;ad wants people to know that McCain has had his own fling as the media's favorite politician, although it's a stretch to say that McCain's been &quot;Washington's favorite celebrity&quot; for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's not the real point the ad is trying to make. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal is to drill home the message that McCain and the very unpopular President Bush are head-butting, kissing cousins, politically speaking, and that electing McCain would be the same as giving Bush and the fatcat oil and drug companies four more years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a problem for McCain, a direct assault on his self-proclaimed reputation as a Washington maverick, beholden to no one but the voters and, as McCain puts it, &quot;the country we love.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad might try to do too much. Bush is unpopular, so it makes sense to try to link McCain with him. But Letterman, Leno, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;The View&quot; aren't exactly on the same celebrity low road as Britney and Paris.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The Democrats on Friday, Aug. 8, continued to make hay out of reports that Sen. John McCain and his campaign manager, a former lobbyist, worked to help secure the 2003 deal that allowed DHL to acquire Airborne Express. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said they wish McCain would devote the same energy he spent bringing German-owned DHL to the U.S. to the task of saving the more than 8,000 jobs at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama began airing a radio ad in Ohio blasting McCain for not being as vehement about the lost jobs as he was about allowing DHL to buy U.S.-owned Airborne Express in 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now 8,200 Ohioans are facing layoffs, and foreignowned DHL doesn't care,&quot; the ad claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's&nbsp;ad followed a Web ad the Ohio Democratic Party launched Thursday, also bashing McCain on the issue. McCain, who visited Wilmington on Thursday, told DHL workers in a private meeting that he wants the federal government to investigate whether DHL's proposal to hire UPS for air freight violates laws intended to encourage market competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, McCain admitted even that may not be enough to save the Wilmington jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a conference call Friday, Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, called revelations of McCain's earlier lobbying &quot;the most important development in the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ohio is a must-win state for John McCain,&quot; he said, arguing that this could imperil McCain's chances with Ohio voters already concerned about the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama met with Wilmington activists in July during a campaign visit to Dayton. He has also written a letter to the Bush administration's point man on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign promptly organized a press conference featuring campaign spokeswoman Nancy Pfotenhauer and Mary Houghtaling, a Wilmington resident and cofounder and president of the Community Care Hospice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Houghtaling's husband is a pilot whose job likely will be lost if DHL and UPS go forward with their plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Houghtaling, who first asked McCain about DHL during an earlier campaign swing in Portsmouth, said she likes McCain because &quot;I asked him to come here, he did&quot; to listen to the problems. She said she's angry at Obama for criticizing McCain's honest admission that he might not be able to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am offended ... it's a shameful, horrible thing to use us to promote himself,&quot; she said. &quot;It's not a kind thing to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the occasional references to her in the news media, I never really knew much about Paris Hilton before this week. I understood that she was famous and, judging by her photos, not bad looking. Other than that, though, all I knew is that she apparently spends a lot of her time hanging around with other famous women, all of whom look exactly alike to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason I didn't know anymore about her until now is simple: I never cared. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But since she is running for president, I realized it was my civic duty as an informed American to find out as much as I can about her, starting with an in-depth study of whatever photos there might of her out there on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the unlikely event that you were somehow able to avoid the &quot;news&quot; that Hilton was running for president, here's how it happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, who also is running for president, recently approved a campaign ad claiming that Barack Obama was nothing more than a celebrity, comparing him to Hilton and Britney Spears. So Hilton responded with a video on the Web site Funny or Die (www.funnyordie.com), which she recorded while lounging poolside in a bathing suit and a pair of pumps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey America, I'm Paris Hilton and I'm a celebrity, too,&quot; she declared. &quot;Only I'm not from the olden days and I'm not promising change like that other guy. I'm just hot. But then that wrinkly, white-haired guy used me in his campaign ad, which I guess means I'm running for president. So thanks for the endorsement, white-haired dude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want America to know that I'm, like, totally ready to lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video immediately hit the Internet, including Wikipedia, which reported, &quot;Her response impressed many outside her immediate fans by its eloquence ... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Australian television station reporting on the &quot;socialite's cheeky campaign ad&quot; claimed that she had announced that her runningmate would be Rihanna, her first official act would be to paint the White House pink and that her campaign slogan will be &quot;That's hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hilton, my research discovered, has a long list of credentials that neither McCain nor Obama can match. Her self-titled album was praised as &quot;more fun than anything released by Britney Spears or Jessica Simpson&quot;; a vocalist can't hope for much higher praise than that. Her performance in the movie &quot;House of Wax,&quot; won the Teen Choice Award for &quot;Best Scream.&quot; She also received a nomination for &quot;Best Frightened Performance&quot; at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards.&quot; Not only does she have her own line of perfume, she recently posed nude to promote an Italian wine that is sold in cans. When it comes to posing nude for canned wine, Paris Hilton clearly is a better choice than John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, I suppose, that thing about having to rewrite the Constitution to allow a 27-year-old to become president. But maybe it's time for that. We've been electing guys older than age of 35 for the past 200 years and what good has it done us?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if Paris Hilton throws her hat, or other article of clothing, into the ring, I definitely will get behind her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though I'm not too crazy about her playing the wrinkly, white-haired guy card.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIMA - The old John McCain showed up here in this Republican stronghold, the candidate who sometimes sounds as if he's running against his own party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't work for a party. I don't work for a president. I don't work for a special interest,&quot; McCain said to frequent applause before about 1,400 participants in a town hall meeting at the Veterans' Memorial Civic and Convention Center. &quot;I don't work for myself. I work for you and the country we love.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a reprise from McCain's unsuccessful 2000 quest for the Republican presidential nomination as he cast himself this time as the independent-minded underdog against Democrat Barack Obama, the Illinois senator, in this year's race for the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, RUrbana, introduced McCain, who was accompanied by his wife Cindy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain tried to distance himself from Obama, the Democratically-controlled Congress and Republican President George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday he (Obama) accused me of having President Bush's policies on energy... Sen. Obama voted for that (Bush's) bill and its big oil giveaways,&quot; said McCain. &quot;I know he hasn't been in the Senate that long, but even in the real world, voting for something means you support it and voting against something means you oppose it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isaac Baker, Obama's spokesman, lashed back. &quot;The facts speak for themselves. John McCain voted with George Bush 95 percent of the time and has proposed $4 billion in additional tax giveaways to big oil,&quot; said Baker. &quot;Sen. Obama has a serious plan to end our dependence on foreign oil by investing in a range of alternative energies that will boost Ohio's economy and create good-paying new jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said if he were president he'd call Congress back from its five-week recess and not let members go until they came up with an energy plan to reduce America's independence on foreign oil. He pushed for offshore oil drilling, clean coal technology, nuclear power and alternatives such as wind and solar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aboard his &quot;Straight Talk Express&quot; bus on the way from Marion to Lima, McCain even mixed it up long distance with Butler County Sheriff Richard K. Jones. Jones, a fellow Republican, criticized McCain in a half-page newspaper ad on Thursday for not speaking out against illegal immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know he's a very busy man,&quot; McCain said of Jones. &quot;He ought to tune into CSPAN&quot; to hear what McCain's been saying about immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the town hall meeting, McCain said his top priority for reforming immigration is to secure the borders. A guest worker program also is needed and there must be a &quot;com-</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain called Thursday for a federal investigation into plans by the DHL shipping company that could cost 10,000 jobs here, as he and his campaign manager took criticism for helping DHL complete a key corporate merger in 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Democrats and labor groups blaming McCain and his campaign manager Rick Davis for their role in the threat to local jobs, McCain moved to demonstrate his concern about possible job losses in this critical swing state that gave President Bush the electoral votes needed for re-election in 2004. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican presidential candidate called on the Justice Department to begin an antitrust investigation into DHL's plans to puts its packages aboard the planes of a rival, United Parcel Service, before delivering them in DHL trucks. Because UPS flies out of Louisville, Ky., the plans call for shutting the DHL shipping hub here that uses the Wilmington airport and eliminating up to 10,000 jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain met with elected officials and residents of the southwest Ohio city to discuss the DHL plans. &quot;I can't assure you that this train wreck isn't going to happen, but I will do everything in my power to see that we avert it,&quot; McCain told the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Should this happen, DHL will cede significant elements of cost and quality to one of its chief competitors. Consumers all over America would suffer,&quot; McCain told reporters later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Congress may need to intervene and, if DHL is allowed to proceed, he would like to see a rapid response to help displaced workers and to try to attract other commercial development at the Wilmington site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer broke the story, Democrats and labor groups have been eagerly pointing out that five years ago McCain and Davis aided German-owned DHL in completing its purchase of U.S.-owned competitor Airborne Express, which had long operated the Wilmington shipping hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a campaign visit last month, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama met with Wilmington Mayor David Raizk to pledge his help if elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2003, McCain, as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee urged then-Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens to abandon a proposed bill to prohibit foreign-owned carriers from flying U.S. military equipment or troops. Airborne Express said the bill was aimed at torpedoing its merger with DHL, the U.S.-based shipping unit of German postal service Deutsche Post AG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, when he was a lobbyist, Davis helped persuade Congress to accept the merger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis took a leave of absence from his lobbying practice to work for McCain. A campaign spokesman said Davis had not worked with DHL since 2005, long before DHL announced plans to move its work out of Wilmington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Thursday, McCain, who has contended that Obama is willing to lose in Iraq to win the election, said his rival would forfeit the war as part of an agenda that also promotes big government and high taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain told those gathered for a town hall meeting in Lima, in northwest Ohio, that Obama is a talented orator with an agenda that could be boiled down to simple policies the Arizona Republican opposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government is too big, he wants to grow it. Taxes are to high, he wants to raise them,&quot; McCain said during the meeting. &quot;Congress spends too much and he proposes more. We need more energy and he's against producing it. We're finally winning in Iraq, and he wants to forfeit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIMA Ohio</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's efforts to define Barack Obama have been well cataloged in recent days, from the substantive (calling Obama a tax raiser slow to offer an energy plan) to the silly (comparing the Illinois senator to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's less apparent are McCain's efforts to define himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP presidential hopeful has adopted a new campaign slogan, &quot;Country First,&quot; a paean to his years in the military and decades in Congress. He's begun speaking more openly about his years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. And despite his wealth and elite legacy as the scion of admirals, McCain has tried to cast himself the embodiment of middle-class, middle-American values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new effort was in full swing Thursday, when he spoke at a town hall meeting in northwestern Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the heartland of America!&quot; McCain proclaimed repeatedly, saying there is no more patriotic part of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator then repeated his usual litany of complaints about Obama, warning, &quot;We don't need another politician in Washington who puts self-interest and political expediency ahead of problem solving.&quot; But in closing, McCain offered supporters a more personal glimpse into his own history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will always, always, always put my country first. I have done that from the time I was in prison and was offered a chance to go home before my comrades,&quot; McCain said, explaining that he refused to leave because the military code of conduct said prisoners must leave in order of capture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I put my country first then and will continue to put country first,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a new twist on a time-honored GOP strategy for McCain, who continues to trail Obama in national and most state battleground polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, Republican presidential candidates have successfully cast their Democratic rivals as big spenders and out-of-touch elitists, an approach McCain is heartily embracing this time. Among other things, he's mocked Obama's popularity in Europe while his campaign manager has noted the Illinois senator's fondness for protein bars and organic tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new McCain&nbsp;ad unveiled Friday shows Obama on the cover of several national magazines, including Vanity Fair, and contends that the Democrat would raise taxes on the middle class and small businesses. In fact, Obama's proposal would raise taxes on couples making more than $250,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain has not established a recognizable personal identity. President Bush was already a well-defined figure in his own right in 2004 when he began making mincemeat of rival John Kerry's alleged policy flip-flops and penchant for windsurfing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's aides said their polling indicates voters have a generally favorable impression of McCain, but know little about his biography or life story. So he's begun retelling that history, using it as a double-edged weapon to cast himself as a selfless patriot and Obama as shallow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence the &quot;country first&quot; slogan, which has gradually supplanted McCain's earlier theme of &quot;Reform, Prosperity and Peace.&quot; Asked if the campaign was suggesting McCain puts country first while Obama puts himself first, senior adviser Charlie Black replied, &quot;That's a fair characterization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan said, &quot;While there's no doubt Senator McCain has served his country with honor, the agenda he's supported over the last eight years has not served the nation as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many other Democrats believe McCain has put his heroic personal tale to use in a way that differs little from past GOP efforts to frame the Democratic Party's presidential hopefuls as unpatriotic and weak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's about John McCain. It's about making Obama different, foreign, other,&quot; said Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, who saw his former client, Kerry, wither under a hazing at the hands of Karl Rove and others on Bush's political team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shrum called McCain's strategy &quot;warmed-over Rovian stew&quot; unlikely to be effective this year. &quot;These people are running a bad version of the last campaign 2008 is not 2004,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The examples McCain uses are telling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He often speaks of his early support last year for sending an additional 30,000 troops to Iraq, a relatively lonely position at the time and one many analysts predicted would cost him the election. His willingness to stand for a once-unpopular position showed he put patriotism over self-interest, McCain argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said at that time I would much rather lose a political campaign than lose a war. Senator Obama took a different path,&quot; McCain told supporters in Cincinnati. &quot;He doesn't understand this isn't a political issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter of McCain's incarceration in Vietnam is complicated, placing him on rhetorical ground he has claimed in the past he'd prefer not to exploit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Naval aviator, McCain was shot down during a bombing mission over North Vietnam in 1967 and held as a prisoner of war until 1973. He was repeatedly tortured and turned down early release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has written a best-selling memoir that include vivid descriptions of his experiences in Vietnam, but has generally been reticent about discussing the matter on the trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's changed markedly in recent days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His tale of refusing early release has become a staple of his stump speech. Visiting football practice Wednesday at Marshall University in West Virginia, McCain told the players he'd learned the value of teamwork during his incarceration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we didn't work as a team they broke us down ... we were a team and we had leaders,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign has also broadcast two biographical television ads in the last two months, although neither is currently on the air. Aides say another biographical ad will likely debut after the Republican convention next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The double-edged use of his history was on display in one of the biographical ads aired earlier this summer. It described McCain's experience in Vietnam and contrasted it with images of the so-called Summer Of Love hippie slang for the summer of 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Half a world away, another kind of love, of country. John McCain: Shot down. Bayoneted. Tortured.&quot; the ad said, implicitly tying the 47-year old Obama to the 60s-era culture wars even though he was only six years old in 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An analysis by the Wisconsin Advertising Project found that over 90 percent of the ads Obama has aired in the last two months are positive, not mentioning McCain by name. Approximately a third of the McCain's are negative, drawing contrasts between himself and Obama.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;Pocket,&quot; 30 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Producer: Obama for America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where to see it: It's airing in several key states, including Ohio. View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/eyeonohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: Announcer: &quot;Every time you fill your tank, the oil companies fill their pockets. Now Big Oil's filling John McCain's campaign with $2 million in contributions because, instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers, McCain wants to give them another $4 billion in tax breaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After one president in the pocket of Big Oil, we can't afford another. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama: A windfall profits tax on Big Oil to give families $1,000 rebate. A president who will stand up for you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: &quot;I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: The video begins with shots of people filling their tanks at gas stations, then cuts to McCain. Then it's back to shots of high gas prices, lines of traffic and McCain. Grim, serious music plays behind a gravesounding commentator. Over these shots is text: $143 billion in profits over the last year, $2 million in oil contributions, $4 billion new tax breaks for oil, all citing sources in smaller text below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then it's a shot of President Bush which slides over to reveal McCain, standing next to him. The ad then cuts to Barack Obama talking to a rally, a crowd of people, individuals in a restaurant booth, then standing before a big, placard-wielding crowd. There's text here, too: $1,000 energy rebate and NewEnergyForAmerica.com, a site that highlights Obama's energy plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: Once again, the presidential debate parallels the congressional debate: Republicans say that Democrats are too worried about hugging trees to drill for new sources of oil, and Democrats counter that Republicans are in the pockets of oil companies and that's why they want to drill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ad, timed to coincide with the release of Obama's New Energy for America Plan, which would give middle-class families a $1,000 rebate funded by a windfall profits tax on oil companies, highlights the latter argument and also throws in a visual dig reiterating their argument that a vote for McCain is actually a vote for a third Bush term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we're going to be picky, McCain didn't actually receive $2 million from oil companies - companies themselves are barred from contributing directly to a candidate. Rather, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, McCain has received $1.3 million from individuals who represent or work for oil or gas companies or political action committees that represent them. (He got the most money from retirees, according to the center: more than $18 million.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center, in a fact sheet on its Web site, said that Obama's campaign appears to have added its $1.3 million figure with one from a Washington Post story reporting the amount of oil and gas money given to a separate fundraising organization that is giving money to McCain, the Republican National Committee and various state parties, to get the $2 million figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama campaign's method for calculating the total amount that McCain's campaign has collected from the oil and gas industry may result in some double-counting,&quot; according to the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil and gas didn't make Obama's top 20, according to the center. Still, oil and gas interests gave Obama $394,465.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign also retorts that Obama voted for a 2005 energy bill that included billions for oil and gas production. McCain voted against that bill. An Obama spokesman told the Associated Press that the Illinois Democrat voted for the bill because it invested in renewable energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's claim that McCain wants to cut taxes for oil companies by $4 billion also doesn't tell the whole story. McCain actually has proposed cutting the tax rate on all U.S. businesses - including oil and gas companies - from 25 to 35 percent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YOUNGSTOWN - During his recent Ohio campaign stops, Sen. Barack Obama has learned to appreciate a few things about the Buckeye state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Aug. 5, he got another treat: homegrown peaches. After a town meeting outside Youngstown, Obama made an impromptu stop along with fellow Democrats Sherrod Brown and Ted Strickland at Stahl's Farm Market near Ravenna. He bought one bag of apple fritters - and three bags of peaches. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is all on me,&quot; Obama joked when it came time to pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a light moment in a day devoted to more serious topics like energy independence and Republican John McCain's&nbsp;ad campaign, which Obama characterizes as negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain wants to talk about Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. That's his idea of a really relevant campaign,&quot; Obama said, referring to a McCain campaign ad that paints Obama as a celebrity. &quot;But I don't have time to deal with that mess because America is facing some serious problems. America is facing some serious challenges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech similar to one he delivered in Dayton last month, Obama called for a $150 billion investment over 10 years in clean energy alternatives, a mandate that Americans get more of the electricity from renewable resources, and a push for more fuel efficient vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He criticized McCain's call for a gas tax holiday - saying it might save consumers $28, if oil companies pass along the Learn about</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The truth is we wouldn't see a drop of oil from John McCain's plan for at least seven years. It's not a real solution, it's a political answer of the sort Washington engages in every few years,&quot; Obama told the crowd of 2,300 supporters. Although Obama spokesman Isaac Baker said the Democrat would consider off-shore drilling as part of a comprehensive approach to energy issues, McCain's camp quickly dismissed Obama's commitment to drilling. &quot;While Americans are hurting, Barack Obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for Big Oil that he's campaigning against today,&quot; said McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds. Obama said he'd offer a $1,000 tax break per family, paid for by a tax on the record oil profits, as a way to ease the pain at the pump. ?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama blamed Republican energy policies for some of the nation's economic woes Tuesday as his GOP rival John McCain advocated a large expansion of nuclear power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates roamed the economically depressed Rust Belt touting their energy plans as concerns about $4-a-gallon gasoline and job losses have emerged as the presidential campaign's hottest issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama told an audience in Youngstown, Ohio, that the Bush energy policy, crafted in large part by Vice President Dick Cheney, an ex-oilman, tilted to provide tax breaks and favorable treatment for Big Oil and that McCain would expand oil industry tax breaks by $4 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has proposed an excess profits tax on Big Oil to finance a $1,000-per-family energy rebate to deal with high fuel costs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exxon-Mobil &quot;makes in 30 seconds what the typical Ohio worker makes in a year,&quot; Obama said. &quot;We need more jobs and economic development. Why don't we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work? Nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside Detroit, another depressed Rust Belt city, McCain became the first presidential candidate in recent memory to tour a nuclear plant. His energy proposals include building 45 nuclear power plants by 2030 to reduce the nation's reliance on oil imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants 'doesn't make sense for America.' He also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing. I couldn't disagree more. I have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants. That means new jobs, and that means new energy. If we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug-in electric cars, we need electricity to plug into,&quot; McCain said at the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, nuclear power alone is not enough. Drilling alone is not enough. We need to do all this and more. That is why I am calling for an 'all of the above' approach.&quot; Like Obama, McCain has multibillion-dollar, long-term plans to reduce oil imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to safety concerns that have long stalled the nuclear industry's growth, McCain boasts that the Navy, in which he served as a fighter pilot, has safely operated nuclear power plants in aircraft carriers and submarines without an accident in 60 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet recent events somewhat undercut that message. Last week, the Navy announced that one of its nuclear-powered submarines, the USS Houston, had leaked minimally radioactive water into harbors since March as the sub traveled around the Pacific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two candidates sparred as an Associated Press-Ipsos poll released Tuesday showed that solid margins among women, minorities and young voters have given Obama a 6-percentage-point lead over McCain. Obama is ahead 47 percent to 41 percent among registered voters, the poll showed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain led by 10 points among whites and is even with Obama among men, groups with whom Republicans traditionally do well in national elections. He has a 17-point lead with white men and was running strongly among married men, rural residents and white evangelicals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama led by 13 points among women, by 30 points among voters up to age 34, and by 55 points among blacks, Hispanics and other minorities, the poll shows. He also is doing well with unmarried men, moderates and city dwellers, and has a 12-point lead among those saying they definitely plan to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With polls showing increasing numbers of voters favoring oil drilling off the U.S. coast, Obama has scrambled in recent days to add new elements to his overall long-term energy policy of promoting fuel-efficient autos and developing alternate energy sources. He dropped his total opposition to more oil drilling if a limited, environmentally careful offshore plan would help pass a long-term energy bill. He also reversed himself to advocate release of oil from the nation's strategic reserve to help drive down gasoline prices in the short-run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama emphasized the key role of Cheney, the unpopular vice president, in President Bush's energy policy, Republicans were quick to point out a contradiction in his criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, he had an energy policy. He turned to Dick Cheney and he said, 'Cheney, go take care of this,'&quot; Obama said. &quot;Cheney met with renewable-energy folks once and oil and gas (executives) 40 times. McCain has taken a page out of the Cheney playbook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama voted for a 2005 energy bill backed by Bush that included billions in subsidies for oil and natural gas production, a measure Cheney played a major role in developing. McCain opposed the bill on grounds it included billions in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has said the Illinois senator supported the legislation because it included huge investments in renewable energy. And Obama aides emphasized Tuesday that Obama at the time had voted for an amendment to strip the legislation of the tax breaks for the oil and gas industries. When the amendment was defeated, he voted for the overall measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said, &quot;Barack Obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for Big Oil that he's campaigning against today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuing to criticize McCain's energy program at an afternoon town hall at Baldwin Wallace College in Berea, Ohio, Obama noted that his energy policy had won the support of oilman T. Boone Pickens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;T. Boone Pickens is about as conservative a guy as there is. That's a serious Republican. Oil man. Driller. He says we can't drill our way out of the problem. I think he knows more about it than John McCain,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickens said Monday he was &quot;strongly encouraged by Sen. Obama's speech on America's energy future. Foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickens has been on a $58 million publicity tour to promote his plan to erect wind turbines in the Midwest to generate electricity, replacing the 22 percent of U.S. power produced from natural gas. The freed-up natural gas then could be used for transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also produced a new TV ad that emphasized his independent streak to counter Obama's charges that he's the same as Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Washington's broken. John McCain knows it. We're worse off than we were four years ago,&quot; says the ad. &quot;He's the original maverick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also tried to cast McCain, a four-term Arizona senator, as a change agent, a claim Obama has made for himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only McCain has taken on big tobacco, drug companies, fought corruption in both parties,&quot; the ad says. &quot;He'll reform Wall Street, battle Big Oil, make America prosper again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It does not mention areas where McCain and Bush agree, like tax cuts, the Iraq war and free-market economics, a point the Obama campaign highlighted in its response to the ad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that very issue of The New Yorker magazine that had the cover showing Barack and Michelle Obama in terrorist gear - intended as a sendup of dumb charges, but appearing to some as a dumb charge - there happened to be a piece dealing with political satire. Writer Hendrik Hertzberg began:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the World Wide Web's most distinguished organs of fake news, the Borowitz Report, leads its current issue with this flash: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; 'The liberal blogosphere was aflame today with new accusations that Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., is trying to win the 2008 presidential election.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Borowitz Report was making fun of the born-yesterday bloggers who were fainting in shock every time Sen. Obama did anything that seemed political, like reneging on his promise to accept federal campaign money, or endorsing a centrist bill on anti-terrorist surveillance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the following complaint is in the same mold as those bloggers, in that it is premised on too-high expectations for a candidate. Nevertheless:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's campaign so far is a disappointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once upon a time, he seemed - didn't he? - like a guy who would resist turning to the slash-and-burn tactics associated with the likes of Karl Rove. He talked about wanting a &quot;respectful&quot; campaign. He invited his opponent to share the stage with him at multiple events. He trashed certain kinds of charges made against Sen. Obama, such as those made by Ohio talk show host Bill Cunningham and Columbus-based preacher/activist Rod Parsley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But look at what's happening now. A nonpartisan Web site named FactCheck.org monitors campaign ads for truth. It is widely respected. Here's a list of five of the six most recent postings as this editorial was being researched:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;A new McCain&nbsp;ad calls Obama a celebrity (true) who says he'll raise taxes on electricity (false).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;A McCain TV spot falsely insinuates that Obama canceled his visit (to injured troops) because 'the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras.' &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;Under-the-radar (McCain) Web ad quotes the Cuban's (i.e., Fidel Castro's) praise but omits his criticism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;McCain&nbsp;ad says Obama's the guy to thank for emptying our wallets at the filling station. We say that's ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;A McCain TV ad says Obama 'voted against funding our troops.' He did, once. Every other time he voted in favor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohioans have been exposed to more of these silly ads than just about anybody, because the campaign are focusing on certain states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's tough stuff at the Fact-Check site about pro-Obama ads, too, and there will be more. (Indeed, one of the downsides of the McCain approach is that it invites the opposition to the low road.) But you get the idea about who's setting the campaign tone now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One day Sen. Obama is a possible socialist; the next, he proposes a tax on electricity that Sen. McCain opposes; or he's Fidel Castro's guy; or he &quot;would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign;&quot; or he wants to raise taxes on people making less than $32,000; or he's responsible for high gas prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumably there will come a time when the McCain campaign returns to the high road, touting its own guy as a man of exceptional, demonstrated character and a not-so-partisan, not-so-political figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when that time comes - dictated by the views of professionals as to what the moment calls for - it will mean less because of what is happening now.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes this job is just too easy. So here we have Ken Blackwell calling Barack Obama &quot;radical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You gotta love it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the same J. Kenneth Blackwell who got a spectacularly low 37 percent of the vote in his bid for governor of Ohio in 2006 after being forced to back off his beloved antitax proposal - his calling card - because so many of his fellow Republicans saw it as - what's the word? - radical. Yes, that's it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blackwell spent much of his life trying to position himself as far to the right as he could without becoming a laughingstock. Some might say he miscalculated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He gambled that being consistently more conservative than the Ohio leaders of the more conservative party - and always being at odds with moderates - would cause him to be seen by voters as principled, not radical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being defeated, he went to work with, among others, the Family Research Council. Radical? That's the organization founded by Dr. James Dobson, the religiousright figure who has said he will sit out the election rather than vote for John McCain, that notorious liberal. (The current head of the FRC is on board for McCain, though reluctantly.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Blackwell, Obama is successfully uniting his party behind him. His views on the issues are no problem in that regard. Anybody who watched the &quot;debates&quot; during the presidential primaries - with a dozen or some such number of Democrats all in a row - knows that candidates were peas in a pod, with Obama fitting right in. If there was a Ken Blackwell there, calling his party away from the center, it was Dennis Kucinich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only is Obama not the Blackwell of his party, he is practically the opposite. His pitch is that the ideological warriors are among the nation's problems. He says he is all about getting beyond all that, to what unites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, he has a liberal voting record. And, yes, some hair-splitting measurements of voting records show him as the &quot;most liberal&quot; in the Senate in certain ways during a short period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;radical&quot; stuff doesn't even come up for votes in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The simple truth is that no fairminded and knowledgeable person sees Obama as anything other than a generic Democrat on the issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some of the warriors on the right have given up on the word &quot;liberal.&quot; It just doesn't seem to frighten or anger enough people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blackwell is front-and-center in a campaign effort being put together by a conservative group calling itself Citizens United. A &quot;documentary&quot; called &quot;Hype: The Obama Effect&quot; is in the works. The idea is that the senator is an unexamined media darling. As of now, there's a 30-second television ad and a trailer for the documentary at the Web site (citizensunited.org).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ad and trailer, Blackwell doesn't use the word radical. He just talks about the need to &quot;peel back the layers&quot; on Obama's appealing facade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a quote highlighted on the Web site, he makes clear that what he sees underneath is &quot;a disturbing pattern of his radical agenda that is measurable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort seems to be aimed at Dobson conservatives. The idea is to convince them that, whatever they might think of McCain, Obama is so much worse. He's a &quot;socialist of the worst kind&quot; in the words of Armstrong Williams (the radio talker who took government money to promote Bush administration policies).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One might think that the funders of this tripe would worry that some conservative voters would take it as an insult to their intelligence. But, whatever. It's their money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the talking heads in the trailer - most of whom are just right-wing warriors doing their thing - is the indisputably respectable writer and scholar Shelby Steele (who really needs to be more careful about the company he keeps).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He doesn't say much more than &quot;Obama is not a conviction politician.&quot; It's a slam, yes, but almost the opposite of &quot;radical.&quot; Indeed, it's the same conclusion that Obama's critics in the liberal blogosphere are coming to: that he's one who looks for the political center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Steele is saying is that Obama is no Ken Blackwell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK, I guess I have to get back to work now.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have you ever thought about bringing an 8-foot-tall burning torch to a political rally? What about drinking John McCain-brand juice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those gestures may sound creepy today, but burning torches were one of the first examples of American campaign memorabilia in the 1800s. And presidential nominees in the 1960s had their names emblazoned on juice cans, including Barry Goldwater's &quot;gold water&quot; &quot;The right drink for the conservative taste.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't all witch-hunting and thirst-quenching; there was plenty of potty humor, too. In fact, early American campaign memorabilia makes today's wry slogans on T-shirts look tame. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some trinkets were signs of the times never to be seen again, like the McKinley parasol, the Eisenhower cigarette pack and the Kennedy paper dress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others have evolved. The political button may have gotten its start as coat buttons like the ones made to commemorate Washington's inauguration in 1789, said Sara Henry, deputy director and chief curator of the Museum of the City of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This brass button says 'Long live the president,' and this one has his initials in the middle,&quot; she said, pointing to the encased artifacts. The buttons are part of the exhibit &quot;Campaigning for President: New York and the American Election,&quot; which is open at the museum through Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was not until the middle of the 19th century when all white men got the vote as opposed to just land owners that political parties used memorabilia to &quot;sell&quot; candidates to the masses, Henry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tall torches adorned with photos of candidates were passed out during rallies and parades to light the dark streets. Paper lanterns decorated with a candidate's picture, a rare item because most burned, were also used for campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Henry Harrison, elected in 1840 after a political career in Ohio, is said to be the first candidate to actively campaign for president, said Larry Bird, curator of the Division of Politics and Reform at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. In addition to torch poles topped with his signature log cabin, the campaign made domestic items such as women's brushes and sewing boxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was plenty of negative campaigning, too. One of the earliest examples at the New York exhibit is the Grover Cleveland and Allen Thurman chamber pot from 1888. Then there are the William McKinley pigs. Playing on the phrase, &quot;In a pig's ass, I'd vote for McKinley,&quot; the little pigs have a hole at the rear that you can look through and see a picture of McKinley, an Ohio native.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You do see a lot of potty humor in American politics,&quot; Henry said. &quot;We haven't included a lot of it in the exhibit because much of it is just so juvenile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Jennings Bryan, a candidate known for his long speeches, was frequently represented by a coffin along with the phrase, &quot;Talked to death.&quot; And then there's the McKinley doll. The porcelain and cloth doll, when held upright, is McKinley. When turned upside down, it's an African-American baby, referring to the accusation he fathered an illegitimate black child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1944, a poster impugned vice presidential candidate Harry Truman by drawing him in a Ku Klux Klan outfit. More functional items are the Reagan slippers, the comb to &quot;Comb Nixon out of your hair,&quot; and the Kerry flip-flops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The post-World War II era was the heyday of memorabilia, says Bird. &quot;I like Ike&quot; nylon stockings were created at a time when women started to expose more of their legs. And as technology advanced, so did the political button, which started off as a lithograph printed directly on metal, says Mort Berkowitz, who has thousands of buttons going back to the 1800s and is also known as &quot;the Button Man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the '60s came the quirky juices like Goldwater's and the Lyndon Johnson juice can &quot;A drink for health care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was political but also social,&quot; Bird said. &quot;That's what's changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When campaigning on television became standard, the focus began to shift. Buttons got bigger, presumably to play to the TV cameras. Candidates spent more money on commercials than tchotchkes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bird recalls being unable to get a button at the New Hampshire campaign office for Democratic candidate Paul Simon in 1988, although he could watch a video of the candidate's biography. &quot;If I'm a candidate, I'd rather have a million people wearing my button than I would have someone just watch my television commercial,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's impossible to know which products from today's campaigns will be collector's items, although we may go ahead and decide that the Barack Obama thong was a bad idea. But Bird says despite all the changes, the underlying purpose always remains the same: to feel a part of it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a need for people who want to participate to have material with which to express themselves,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was smart to decline financing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until recently, I was an ardent supporter of Sen. Barack Obama. That is, until I saw a television ad that informed me that he is singularly responsible for the high prices at the gas pump. Wow, he's one powerful man! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All kidding aside, I'm sure there's at least a small segment of the population that now believes that to be true, and good luck in convincing them otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you doubt that, consider the fact that there are people who still believe the Internetgenerated rumor that he's a Muslim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is why Obama was smart to decline public financing and rely on private campaign donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's going to need as much money as possible to try to set the record straight when nonsensical ads like this appear.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama editorials help fuel bigotry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re &quot;Obama flip-flop rationale flops,&quot; June 24: I was amazed that, in denouncing Barack Obama's decision to not accept public financing, the Dayton Daily News failed to mention that the candidate has said he will not take lobbyist or PAC money, which does, in fact, really change a lot in Washington. This means that Obama would not come into office owing major favors to the large donors that represent special-interest groups. How can you talk about this issue and not include such vitally important information?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An even worse example of a poorly argued opinion was the July 1 editorial, &quot;He's not Muslim, not that there's anything wrong...&quot;. The DDN complains that Obama has not visited mosques. It makes no mention of the fact that John McCain does not visit mosques; George W. Bush surely did not visit mosques in his campaigning, nor do the majority of candidates. Yet, the DDN points out that Obama doesn't visit mosques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, the smear campaigners have made that a slippery issue - darned if you do, darned if you don't. But what would the DDN have Obama say in the public speech that it suggested on the order of John Kennedy's &quot;Catholic&quot; speech or Mitt Romney's &quot;Mormon&quot; speech? Shame on the newspaper for fueling the fire of those trying to confuse the voters on this fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is a true Christian who invites one and all to the table.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quotes from people in the United States on Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama's trip to Europe and the Middle East:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This trip overseas has an opportunity to backfire on him, because it looks like they're giving him so much attention, they're ignoring John McCain, the war hero.&quot; Terry Alexander, 60, a teacher from Columbia, Mo., speaking about the media attention Obama has drawn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They should vote on who he is and what he does rather than where he goes or what he sees.&quot; Rena Anabtawi, 20, a pharmacy technician from Tampa Bay, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's a political stunt.&quot; Nathaniel Breznau, 25, a sales representative from Manchester, N.H.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's showing his inexperience, which is a concern for a lot of people, especially Democrats like myself who liked Hillary Clinton.&quot; George Londono, 42, now an Obama supporter from Merrimack, N.H.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think dialogue at this point is a good thing.&quot; Michael Holdowski, who was pleased Obama met with Palestinian leaders. Holdowski is president of the Upper Valley Jewish Community, a Hanover, N.H., congregation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seeing the picture ... that's pretty inspiring. That says a lot.&quot; Evan Fontana, 22, a Jewish voter and college student from Atlantic City, N.J., on images of Obama laying a wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not going to be able to gain the experience he needs between now and November.&quot; Tiffany Jackson, 31, a commercial insurance agent from suburban Cincinnati, who had supported Obama's primary rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, but is leaning toward Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've seen finally that after six, seven years, almost eight, that the U.S. is trying to reach out to the world and get them to go back on track and like us instead of hating us.&quot; Amer Almadani, 41, an owner of a towing company who is originally from Jordan, but is a U.S. citizen living in Bristow, Va.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraq war veteran Bill Rausch says Sen. Barack Obama's stance on the war is better foreign policy and better for troops in the field. Fellow Iraq war veteran Josh Mandel couldn't disagree more, arguing that Sen. John McCain has the &quot;gut instinct&quot; needed to lead the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio veterans are taking sides in a presidential campaign in which the Iraq war, now well into its sixth year, continues to divide voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, the Democrats' presumptive presidential nominee, visited Iraq and Afghanistan this week as part of a congressional fact-finding tour that also included a trip to the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rausch and Mandel laid out their positions Monday in dueling news conferences. McCain supporters announcing Ohio Veterans for John McCain made it clear they believed the Republican's military background and experience make him the stronger candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their backers included Senate President Bill Harris, a former Marine and Vietnam veteran who criticized Obama for &quot;making decisions before he actually visited any of the areas where he's complained so much about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama supporters say the Democrat is just as supportive of troops as McCain and downplay his lack of military experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't feel everybody has to serve in the military,&quot; said Army veteran David Jenkinson, 61, of Columbus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats suggested a new McCain&nbsp;ad knocking Obama's failure to visit Iraq was a bit of a cheap shot given that Obama was on his way there when the ad appeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His stance on the war in Iraq is a larger part of our foreign policy, is something that is better for not only our national security but it's better for the men and women who are serving overseas,&quot; said Rausch, an Army captain in Iraq and now director of veterans issues for the Ohio Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rausch, 28, is a 2002 West Point graduate who served in the U.S. Camp Victory headquarters in Baghdad from May 2006 to September 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandel, a state representative who served two tours of duty in Iraq, said McCain has a &quot;gut instinct&quot; that makes him by far the better candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gut instinct cannot be taught,&quot; Mandel said. &quot;Gut instinct cannot be bought. It's something that's developed over time through making tough decisions under mental pressure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandel, 30, served as an intelligence specialist with the Marines in Al Anbar Province from February to October 2004 and again from September 2007 to April 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama favors withdrawing troops from Iraq at the rate of one or two brigades a month for a total of about 16 months, then leaving a residual force in place. McCain says troops should stay until success is determined by commanders on the ground. He's resisted laying out any time tables for departure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates favor a stepped up effort in the war on terror in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a survey conducted in April by The Associated Press and Yahoo News, 63 percent of voters said they want the next president to make removing troops from Iraq a high priority, including 37 percent who want it to be an extremely high priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would seem to favor Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet last month, another AP-Yahoo News poll found that voters believed McCain would do a better job in Iraq than Obama if elected by a margin of 39 percent to 33 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of those surveyed, more than twice as many 44 percent to 20 believe McCain can better handle terrorism than Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are voters who want the troops home siding with McCain over the candidate who's spoken more forcefully about a withdrawal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People don't make the connection between Obama's position on troops and their own position on the war,&quot; said Baldwin-Wallace College political scientist Tom Sutton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if people do make the connection, there's a credibility issue mostly with his inexperience,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think anything can be said about McCain that will take away from voter perception about his abilities to handle foreign policy and military leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAMPAIGN NOTEBOOK:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chairman of &quot;Ohio Veterans for John McCain&quot; is retired Air Force Col. Tom Moe, who spent several years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam with McCain. Moe was shot down and captured by North Vietnamese troops in January 1968. Like McCain, Moe also refused offers from his captors for early release from the so-called &quot;Hanoi Hilton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ohio Democratic Party has created a full-time position for mobilizing the state's Jewish community in support of Obama. Matt Ratner of suburban Cleveland will serve as the party's Jewish Outreach Coordinator. Ratner has worked for the Obama campaign in Chicago and as a caucus organizer in Iowa.</SPAN></P>

View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/eyeonohio. Script: Female announcer: Gas prices - $4, $5, no end in sight, because some in Washington are still saying no to drilling in America. No to independence from foreign oil. Who can you thank for rising prices at the pump? Chant: Obama, Obama! Announcer: One man knows we must now drill more in America and rescue our family budgets.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">eyeonohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">es of a lone gas pump, then flashes between the image of the pump and the pump's price skyrocketing. It then superimposes a picture of a grinning Barack Obama at the pump as its price soars. Then the ad cuts to shots of McCain talking to crowds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: The political battle on how to solve the energy crisis has intensifed the debate about whether to increase domestic oil production. Obama opposes lifting the moratorium on offshore drilling; McCain supports lifting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A consortium of state newspapers takes a look at the candidates' media campaigns in the Buckeye state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain supported the moratorium during his 2000 presidential campaign, but changed course in mid-June. He still opposes drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Bob Ebel of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the high price of oil is spurred by a number of factors, among them booming economies in India and China and geopolitical problems in oil-producing countries such as Nigeria and Venezuela. He said that while there's no one &quot;silver bullet&quot; to bring prices down, an increase in supply could help. But ending the moratorium would not produce new oil for at least five to seven years. And other factors - speculators, OPEC, geopolitical forces - might still impact prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, a report by the Energy Information Administration released last year projected that drilling in the Pacific, Atlantic or eastern Gulf regions &quot;would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That report indicated that because oil prices are determined on the international market, impact on prices &quot;is expected to be insignificant.&quot; That agency falls under the jurisdiction of President George W. Bush, who himself called for lifting the moratorium last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and McCain have decried America's dependence on foreign oil; the two differ on where to go from there. Besides more drilling, McCain supports expanded use of nuclear energy and investing in alternative energy. Obama would invest $150 billion over 10 years to advance the next generation of biofuels and fuel infrastructure, as well as double fuelefficiency standards within 18 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One particular line in the ad is laughable: When the announcer asks, &quot;Who can you thank for rising prices at the pump?&quot; the crowd chants Obama's name. McCain on July 7 delivered a speech in which he said the nation's dependence on foreign oil was &quot;30 years in the making.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The health insurance industry is entering the campaign debate over how to make health care more affordable while retaining a large role for the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry lobbying group, begins a nationwide tour in Columbus on Tuesday to seek comment on its ideas from uninsured Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry, whose famous &quot;Harry and Louise&quot; TV ad campaign helped scuttle President Clinton's efforts to reshape the health care system in the 1990s, says it wants to be less partisan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates for universal health coverage, who recently launched their own campaigns, say the industry listening tour is just a sham designed to impede reform once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't trust insurance companies to fix the health care mess,&quot; says an ad by Health Care for America Now, a coalition of unions that includes the Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, and liberal groups such as the Campaign for America's Future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The insurance industry says its recent proposals will provide access to affordable coverage for all and bring down the costs of health care. It is also on the offensive trying to counteract charges that its profits have grown as more and more Americans have been unable to afford health coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group will run advertisements that draw many of the same conclusions its opponents do that it's unacceptable for 47 million Americans to be uninsured, and that losing your job shouldn't mean losing your insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry no longer wants to simply respond to proposals from Republicans and Democrats and instead wants to drive the debate over health care reform itself, said Karen Ignagni, president and chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can make a contribution to this discussion by bringing solutions to the table,&quot; she said. &quot;We are listening to people, learning what they have to say, as opposed to it being a one-way dialogue or one-way conversation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The insurance industry and its opponents both advocate a combined public-private approach. But the industry, while calling for a modest expansion in the eligibility limits for the State Children's Health Insurance Program and a greater role for Medicaid, leaves private insurance as a driving force in health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry is calling for a health tax credit for up to $500 for families who get insurance for their children, for health accounts through which families can pay for medical expenses with pretax dollars, and for a $50 billion federal grant to help states come up with programs to expand coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health Care for America Now, the labor and liberal coalition, wants strict regulation of the private insurance industry, including limits on when they can deny coverage for pre-existing conditions, and on how high premiums can go. The industry has proposed its own plan to accommodate those whose existing conditions have made it difficult or impossible to find coverage in the private market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're not really interested in covering uninsured Ohioans,&quot; Richard Kirsch, the coalition's national campaign manager, said of the insurance industry. &quot;Americans understand that they put profits before people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health Care for America Now also wants Americans to be able to choose between a government or private health care plan, which would represent a greater emphasis on government in solving the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither the industry nor its opponent plan to advocate for a specific candidate in the presidential campaign, although Health Care for America Now says Democrat Barack Obama's plan meets many of its principles while Republican John McCain's does not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINIONS; Pg. A24</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">734 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's speech at Stivers School for the Arts on Friday, July 11, wasn't anything like his rally at the Nutter Center last spring for sheer size and excitement. That was the biggest, most obviously successful campaign event in Dayton for a least a quarter of a century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after the Nutter event, Obama lost the primary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a sort of rhythm to these campaign events. You don't want to peak too soon. Obama's big Dayton event for the general election is still to come (assuming Ohio continues to be seen as crucial).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday seemed largely to be about rallying the troops, the people who will be working phones and otherwise contributing their labor to the Obama cause. Tickets were distributed through various local Democratic headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the speech wasn't the typical list of applause-generating one-liners. (Actually, a teacher in the audience might have delivered the best applause line of the day when she referred to the &quot;Every Child Left Behind policy.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama wanted to give a speech outlining his energy policies, and he apparently thought Dayton was as good a place as any. (He had decided to approach energy as a security issue; he was introduced by a retired Air Force general.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was a decision not to milk the event for every possible bit of partisan emotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Obama got in his share of swipes at the other side, and his share of uplift. His supporters seemed reasonably happy, even if they didn't leave floating on a cloud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never mind that he said &quot;Strivers.&quot; Actually, &quot;Strivers&quot; isn't all bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's odd to me about the Obama campaign's approach to the Stivers event was how it differed from the campaign's approach to its television ad campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Stivers, the premise was that this is not the end, only a certain stage. On television, the premise is there's no tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama and the McCain campaigns are pouring money into television in Ohio (and a few other states) as if votes are on the line right now. The ads are trashing candidates so absurdly and so often - in prime time - that the consultants seem not to have entertained the possibility that people will get fed up and move. They should.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One gets the impression that the two candidates have agreed to do their best to live down the charge that they are both good men. When some people say, &quot;This is one campaign which nobody can see as a choice between two evils,&quot; they say, &quot;Oh, yeah? Wait till you see this!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For campaign planners who sometimes do seem to have a sense of timing, this obsession with ads in July is amazing. After all, nothing in the whole wide world will have less impact on the outcome of the November election than ads in July. Nothing. Not the outcome of the World Series. Not whether &quot;My Name is Earl&quot; gets renewed. Nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have just come through a season in which, just about every time an outcome was reported in a hotly contested primary, somebody pointed out that the big spender lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are entering a contest which will have the highest profile in the history of elections. This is exactly the kind of election in which the impact of paid advertising is positively known to be at its lowest level, because people are getting input in so many other ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political consultants know that TV viewers are harder and harder to find, because they spread so widely over the cable spectrum, and because they don't record commercials or else they fast-forward past them or else don't even notice them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know that the voters whom the candidates are trying to reach - the not-very-political-people - are skeptical of politicians as a class and doubly skeptical of commercials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet the politicos are frantically dedicated not only to the task of getting huge numbers of ads on the air, but to doing it now, in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This money is just flatly wasted. The Democrats might as well give it to their favorite poor people. The Republicans might as well give it to their favorite rich people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wasting money is one thing. It's an American pastime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But wasting money frantically? Staying up nights to raise money; hiring people to raise it; raising money to raise money, just so that you can spend it as fast as you can on something that has absolutely no value whatsoever?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeah, right, that's the kind of president we're looking for.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINIONS; Pg. A15</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">562 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;Love,&quot; a 60-second television commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Producer: John McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where to see it: It started running Tuesday, July 8, in Ohio and other battleground states. You can view it at DaytonDailyNews.com/eyeonohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: (Male announcer) &quot;It was a time of uncertainty, hope and change. The 'Summer Of Love.' Half a world away, another kind of love - of country. John McCain: Shot down. Bayoneted. Tortured. Offered early release, he said, 'No.' He'd sworn an oath. Home, he turned to public service. His philosophy: before party, polls and self ... America. A maverick, John McCain tackled campaign reform, military reform, spending reform. He took on presidents, partisans and popular opinion. He believes our world is dangerous, our economy in shambles. John McCain doesn't always tell us what we 'hope' to hear. Beautiful words cannot make our lives better. But a man who has always put his country and her people before self, before politics, can. Don't 'hope' for a better life. Vote for one. McCain.&quot; McCain: &quot;I'm John McCain and I approve this message.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: Opens with scenes of San Francisco in the 1960s, then goes to a plane in flight, presumably in Vietnam, then pictures of young John McCain in uniform and gear and in a hospital bed, interspersed with other Vietnam images. Then come pictures of McCain's political career, featuring the likes of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan and even Ohio's John Glenn. McCain giving speeches, meeting voters, looking pensive. Saluting. Smiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: Even back in 2000, when McCain was running for the Republican presidential nomination, his supporters often said that, whatever problems he might have in Republican primaries, he would be a stronger candidate in November than George W. Bush. What they had in mind was the pitch made here: He has a heroic military record and an independent political record that is presumably attractive to independent voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Republican primaries of 2008, McCain went out of his way to downplay the whole &quot;maverick&quot; thing, promoting the contrary image of himself as a &quot;foot soldier in the Reagan revolution,&quot; a phrase he uttered again and again. Just how much he turned his back on his old ways is an issue in the general election. Barack Obama has said &quot;the wheels have come off the 'Straight-talk Express,' &quot; the name of McCain's 2000 campaign bus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain certainly has taken an independent posture on campaign finance reform over the years, pushing for new regulations against all manner of Republican opposition. As for &quot;spending reform,&quot; that's apparently a reference to his work against &quot;earmarks&quot; and &quot;pork-barrel spending&quot; (generally seen as amounting to about 1 percent of the federal budget). &quot;Military reform&quot; is a vague term sometimes associated with the effort to reduce the number of stateside military bases, which he has supported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In declaring &quot;our economy is in shambles,&quot; McCain is trying to distance himself from the president. But he has recently embraced the core of the administration's economic policies, the Bush tax cuts. His references to &quot;hope&quot; are swipes at Obama, who has associated himself with the word. McCain is also saying that just because Obama gives better speeches doesn't mean he'd be a better president.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFL-CIO is mobilizing union members in Ohio and other states who are military veterans to work against Republican presidential candidate John McCain and other office seekers it opposes, officials said Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Sweeney, the president of the labor federation, announced the creation of a Union Veterans Council during a teleconference in this western Ohio city. He was scheduled to discuss the initiative at a downtown rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union, which endorsed Democrat Barack Obama for president last month, plans to form state councils of union veterans in key election battlegrounds, including Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Colorado and West Virginia. Later, it plans to organize in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the Republican National Committee said it is no surprise the AFL-CIO is coming to Obama's assistance and attacking McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big Labor bosses have answered the call for liberal Democrats for decades, but they're mistaken if they think they can use hardworking workers' money to malign a war hero who has dedicated his life to serving his country,&quot; said Blair Latoff, spokesman for the Republican National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new council will include close to a dozen state affiliates and will coordinate other veterans groups &quot;to raise the profile of veterans issues and lead the way in securing an economy that works for all,&quot; Sweeney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the formation of the Union Veterans Council, veterans will be front and center in the effort to put our country back on track,&quot; Sweeney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said key issues will include money for the Veterans Affairs Department, health and education benefits for veterans, and job growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wes Wells, executive director of the Dayton-Miami Valley AFL-CIO, said the council will bring together union veterans from around Ohio to work on electing leaders who will put the concerns of working people first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union also launched an ad that will air Thursday that features a Vietnam combat veteran criticizing McCain's stance on the war in Iraq and on veterans issues. The ad will air for three weeks on national cable and in Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin, union officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outreach effort will include door-to-door canvassing and visits to worksites by veterans to talk to union members about issues in the election. The union also plans to identify and track union veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFL-CIO estimates it has 2.1 million members who are either veterans or are serving in active duty in the military.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first negative ad of the general election campaign, Democrat Barack Obama said John McCain is &quot;part of the problem&quot; of high gas prices and tried to parry Republican criticism of his own energy policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second commercial is a direct response to a Republican Party ad launched this weekend. The GOP spot airing at a cost of $3 million in four states accuses Obama of offering no new solutions to solve high gas prices and global warming. Obama's&nbsp;ad will run in the same states where the Republican National Committee placed its ad Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, his campaign said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's sharp retort comes as worried voters have made the spiking cost of fuel one of the top issues in the presidential campaign. The ad fight also flared amid evidence that Americans appear to be more receptive to some of McCain's proposed solutions, including increased oil drilling in the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On gas prices, John McCain's part of the problem,&quot; the Obama&nbsp;ad states. &quot;McCain and Bush support a drilling plan that won't produce a drop of oil for seven years. McCain will give more tax breaks to big oil. He's voted with Bush 95 percent of the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama will make energy independence an urgent priority. Raise mileage standards. Fast-track technology for alternative fuels. A $1,000 tax cut to help families as we break the grip of foreign oil. A real plan and new energy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Bush want Congress to lift the ban on drilling on the continental shelf. If Congress agrees and states then permit it, energy experts say it would take at least five to seven years before new drilling could begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's claim that McCain would give more tax breaks to oil companies is based on McCain's proposal to cut overall corporate tax rates. The campaign cited a study by the Democratic-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund that concluded McCain's proposal to cut corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 25 percent would cut taxes on the top five U.S. oil companies by $3.8 billion a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, however, did vote against a 2005 energy bill backed by President Bush, saying at the time that it included billions of dollars in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil industry. Obama voted for the legislation. While Obama's&nbsp;ad correctly states that McCain voted with Bush 95 percent of the time in 2007, his support for Bush's position on legislation in 2005 was a low of 77 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama today launched the first attack ad from either campaign in this election, which follows a string of calculating position changes proving that Barack Obama's commitment to a new type of politics is officially over,&quot; said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds. &quot;Even worse, Barack Obama actually voted for the Bush-Cheney energy bill and its big-oil tax breaks that he is attacking, so let's end the pretense that Obama is anything other than a typical politician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign disputed Bounds' claim that the commercial is the first negative ad from either campaign. It cited a Spanish-language McCain radio ad last week that stated that &quot;the other candidate has just discovered the importance of the Hispanic vote.&quot; Another McCain&nbsp;ad on the Web site of the Jerusalem Post shows pictures of Obama and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and poses the question: &quot;Is it OK to unconditionally meet with anti-American foreign leaders?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past several weeks, as fuel prices continued to rise, both candidates have staked out ever more specific positions on energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poll released last week by the Pew Research Center showed that nearly one of every two Americans now rate energy exploration, drilling and building new power plants as the top priority all of them stands embraced by McCain. Only 35 percent gave those steps top priority five months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, a USA Today-Gallup Poll released last month showed that nine in 10 people said energy, including gas prices, would be very or extremely important in deciding their presidential vote in November. People surveyed also said Obama would do a better job than McCain on energy issues by 19 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rising support for drilling, however, has put Democrats on the defensive. The Senate Democratic leadership on Tuesday issued a statement responding to Republican demands to lift the moratorium on offshore exploration. Democrats pointed to Interior Department statistics that show that 32.5 million acres of outer continental shelf lands are under lease but not producing oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite Republican spin to the contrary, Democrats have supported efforts to expand domestic production of oil and gas,&quot; the statement issued by the Senate Democratic Conference Committee said. &quot;Democrats want oil and gas companies to drill for oil on the leases we have given them - both onshore and offshore - and we believe any oil found needs to stay in the U.S.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;Purpose,&quot; 30 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where to see it: It began airing on Ohio television stations on Friday, June 27. View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/eyeonohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: (Announcer): &quot;American technology protected the world. We went to the moon, not because it was easy, but because it was hard. &quot;John McCain will call America to our next national purpose: Energy security. &quot;A comprehensive bipartisan plan to: &quot;Lower prices at the pump. &quot;Reduce dependence on foreign oil through domestic drilling. &quot;And champion energy alternatives for better choices and lower costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Putting country first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: The commercial begins with a collection of familiar photos highlighting this country's dominance in space exploration. It fades to an animated McCain giving a speech with three American flags in the background. Next up are shots of gas pumps, oil wells, solar panels and wind farms. The spot ends with a flattering portrait of the 71-year-old McCain framed in bronze tones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: McCain deftly throws everything but the kitchen sink in this snappy 30-second clip. He invokes American innovation and technological prowess, appealing to Americans' pride and patriotism. He highlights a problem that's on everyone's minds - gas prices - and promises that a McCain administration - in concert with Democrats - will bring prices down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial splashes &quot;Energy Security&quot; on the screen, but, of course, energy independence is inextricably tied to economic security and even national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tone is hopeful and futuristic, aiming to reassure uneasy Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who supports a mandatory limit on greenhouse gas emissions for the country, has proposed establishing a $300 million prize for the innovator who invents a longlasting car battery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama belittled the idea, saying, &quot;When John F. Kennedy decided that we were going to put a man on the moon, he didn't put a bounty out for some rocket scientist to win. He put the full resources of the United States government behind the project.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who has called for a $150 billion investment in alternative energy, attacked McCain this week for advocating to lift the ban on offshore drilling. McCain, who opposes drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, admitted that capturing offshore oil is years away, but said the decision would have a &quot;psychological benefit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reference to nuclear power is absent from the commercial, though McCain supports expanding that industry; Obama is not opposed to it, though he's less enthusiastic than McCain, raising concerns about cost and safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial wraps up with &quot;Country First,&quot; a theme that the McCain campaign thinks it can't overdo in light of their candidate's heroic military service in Vietnam as a naval aviator and then as a prisoner of war for five years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS - Republican John McCain is returning to Ohio to mine for presidential support in two important lodes - undecided voters in Cincinnati and Hillary Clinton-friendly Trumbull County in the Mahoning Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also will raise money at fundraisers in Cincinnati on Thursday, June 26, and in Hunting Valley, a Cleveland suburb, on Friday, June 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's trip comes after a Quinnipiac University poll released June 18 showed Democrat Barack Obama leading McCain, 48 percent to 42 percent in Ohio in the race for president. McCain kicks off the two-day swing on Thursday with a noon town hall meeting at Xavier University in Cincinnati with undecided voters selected by Direct Response Group, a telephone marketing firm. The campaign pays the company from $8,000 to $10,000 per town meeting to select undecided voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sample of undecideds for the Xavier meeting excluded backers of McCain and Obama and voters who said they were either &quot;strong Democrats&quot; or &quot;strong Republicans,&quot; according to a memo from Sarah Simmons, McCain's director of strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a clear swipe at Obama, who packs in thousands for his large-hall rallies, Simmons said, &quot;Rather than giving lofty speeches to the converted behind a teleprompter, John McCain will continue to participate in town hall meetings across the country in an effort to speak to undecided voters and raise the level of dialogue in the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Speaker Jon Husted, R-Kettering, said undecided voters would see McCain as somebody who is &quot;passionate about trying to solve the problems that face America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, these voters will know that McCain is willing to sit down personally with them while Obama &quot;hasn't been willing to show up,&quot; said Husted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign declined McCain's invitation to participate in 10 or more joint town hall meetings this summer. Obama's campaign proposed a town hall meeting on the economy in July and a foreign policy debate in August, but the campaigns couldn't reach agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently they would rather contrive a political issue than foster a genuine discussion about the future of our country,&quot; said David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama last week met with a group of seniors in Columbus that included undecided voters. He spoke and answered questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, McCain will visit the GM plant in Lordstown in Trumbull County, a Democratic stronghold but a county where Hillary Clinton clobbered Obama in the March 4 Democratic primary, getting 62 percent of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a lot of Democrats who didn't vote for Barack Obama who will vote for John McCain in the general election,&quot; said Husted. &quot;... If you get to know what John McCain is about, he's one of the most patriotic, loyal Americans there is. ... He's willing to put America's interests ahead of his own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isaac Baker, Ohio spokesman for Obama, however, predicted McCain &quot;is going to find a very frosty reception&quot; in Lordstown. Baker, who worked for Clinton in the primary, said Democrats are unified going into the general election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain reacted cautiously Thursday after President Bush announced easing economic sanctions against North Korea, a world troublespot one of them will inherit after the next presidential inauguration in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet if history is any guide, McCain would take a hard line against the regime in Pyongyang, in part reflecting his age and military background. Obama, meanwhile, would take a more flexible course, reflective of his legal training and belief that dialogue should underpin U.S. diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in practical terms, both approaches may lead to the same place regardless of who emerges as president: an incremental &quot;actions for actions&quot; approach that was the hallmark of Democrat Bill Clinton's policy and has more recently been adopted by the Republican Bush administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under that policy, Bush lifted trade sanctions against North Korea and moved to remove it from the U.S. terrorism blacklist after the Communist leadership handed over a long-awaited accounting of its nuclear work to Chinese officials. That act fulfilled a key step in the denuclearization process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As long as the strategy looks like it's working in the sense of limiting North Korea's (nuclear) capacity, the next president is going to be so focused on dealing with problems in the Middle East that no one is going to want to pick a fight unnecessarily in northeast Asia,&quot; said Gary Samore, a former North Korea arms negotiator who now serves as vice president of the Council on Foreign Relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reacting to the news, McCain said the six-party talks between China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, the United States and North Korea had obviously yielded some results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My overall impression is that we should be very cautions, as I've said a number of times in the past, but I'll be very interested in hearing all the details of the administration's new position, evolving position on this issue,&quot; the Arizona senator said as he campaigned in Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama struck a similar chord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the words of Ronald Reagan, we have to trust but verify,&quot; the Illinois senator told the FOX Business Network. &quot;But this issue of nuclear nonproliferation is critical. We've let it slip away for too long. Now is the time for us to get back together with other countries around the world and make sure we do not have the kind of proliferation that can fall into the hands of terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At age 71, shaped by his own experience fighting in Vietnam and being held as a prisoner of war, McCain has favored a tough approach with the North Korean regime. Earlier this week, during a town-hall meeting in Fresno, Calif., he waxed poetic about the &quot;Forgotten War&quot; between the United States and Korean Communists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It resulted in a divided peninsula but, in McCain's view, played a pivotal role in stopping the Cold War spread of communism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has also earned accolades from some conservatives for maintaining an even harder line than Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must use the leverage available from the U.N. Security Council resolution passed after Pyongyang's 2006 nuclear test to ensure the full and complete declaration, disablement and irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear facilities, in a verifiable manner, which we agreed to with the other members of the six-party talks. We must reinvigorate the trilateral coordination process with Japan and South Korea,&quot; McCain and Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., wrote last month in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, 46, has used the language of his Harvard Law School education as he has called the six-party talks &quot;ad hoc&quot; and said he favored bilateral negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator has spoken broadly about boosting diplomatic engagement with other countries, even those that have been hostile to the United States like North Korea. He has criticized Bush for limiting diplomatic relations with such nations, often invoking President John F. Kennedy's maxim, &quot;We should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last summer, during a Democratic primary debate, Obama answered &quot;I would&quot; when asked if he would meet without preconditions the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea. His chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Rodham Clinton, quickly jumped on the comment, calling it &quot;irresponsible and, frankly, naive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echoing Clinton, McCain has since said Obama's position shows he lack the experience to serve as commander in chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since clinching the nomination, Obama has sought to clarify his view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Contrary to the claims of some, I have no interest in sitting down with our adversaries just for the sake of talking,&quot; the senator said earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his campaign Web site, Obama also pledges to &quot;forge a more effective framework in Asia that goes beyond bilateral agreements, occasional summits, and ad hoc arrangements such as the six-party talks on North Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's explanation for breaking his word and declining to limit his campaign spending is bogus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he's worried that the Republicans will &quot;Swift Boat&quot; him, meaning run a campaign of ugly, untrue attack ads that are not paid for by the candidate or the party and are, therefore, not subject to campaign spending limits. In fact, however, that threat was more alive when he first made his commitments about campaign finance than they are today. Now there are no Republican 527s (the committees that fund that kind of independent ad) at work or in the works, unlike this stage in 2004. (Yet the Democratic side's MoveOn.org has huge amounts of money.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal government offers a major-party presidential nominee $84 million to run a general-election campaign, on the condition that the candidate foregoes any other kind of money. If the candidate rejects that money, the campaign may spend as much as it can raise, limited only by the fact that contributions by one person may not exceed $2,300. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea behind offering the federal money is partly that nobody should ever be able to say that a candidate bought the presidency. The idea is also that presidential candidates should not have to call bigmoney people for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy has generally worked. Presidential election outcomes seldom get discussed in terms of who had the most money from the most dubious sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in recent elections, these independent organizations have arisen, muddying the water. The Swift Boat campaign against Sen. John Kerry is the most high-profile example. Some people believe (erroneously, in all probability) that the campaign defeated Sen. Kerry. So the question gets asked: Doesn't limiting the candidates as to spending have the effect of making these independent players more important?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, until this year, all presidential nominees have accepted the federal money and the restriction that comes with it. Sen. Obama should have, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason he has rejected it is obviously that he can raise unprecedented amounts of money. Three million contributors have already given unprecedented amounts. (More than 90 percent of those contributions were for less than $200.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He apparently didn't see this phenomenon developing back when he said he'd take the public money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he did know about it more recently, when he repeatedly said he would work something out with Sen. John McCain. He didn't do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most political people seem to believe that Sen. Obama has done what anybody in his position would do. That's probably true. The political community is also virtually united in believing his decision gives him a major advantage. That's probably not true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money is not decisive in highprofile races. The more exposure that candidates get through the news media, the less impact television ads have. This has been seen over and over in the primaries, with the best funded candidates like Mitt Romney losing, and virtually unfunded candidates like Mike Huckabee and John McCain (at certain stages) winning. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton did best in the phase when she was in financial trouble, at the end of the primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet, if Sen. Obama wins in November, his victory will be widely attributed to his money. That's the sad part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Obama believes that, because his money comes from individual idealists, not business interests groups, nobody can say that he is somehow selling out to high bidders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK. But it's a relatively fine point. The larger truth is he is standing up for a system built around competition as to who can raise the most money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a guy who wants to be seen as a reformer and, presumably, as a man of his word, that's a shame.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS - The John McCain presidential campaign opened its Ohio-Pennsylvania regional headquarters in Columbus on Thursday, June 19, and urged volunteers to start making phone calls, putting up yard signs and bumper stickers on their cars. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, McCain's honorary Ohio campaign chairman, said, &quot;I think he has great appeal to people who are concerned about national security and there's no comparison of who has experience in national security - and we are electing a commander in chief.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is expected to do a two-day swing through Ohio next week, stopping in Cincinnati, Youngstown and Cleveland for fundraisers, DeWine said, and he likely will make one or more public appearances as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Barack Obama campaign, which is expected to start airing a 60-second ad in Ohio and 17 other states today, June 20, has yet to open its Ohio campaign headquarters, a spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franklin County judge tosses out campaign law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS - A Franklin County judge on Wednesday, June 18, tossed out a state law that limits awarding state and local government contracts to campaign contributors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Common Pleas Judge John Bender said the law violated the Ohio Constitution, which prohibits lumping more than one subject into a bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Auto Workers and Ohio AFL-CIO challenged the law, passed in the dead of night during a special legislative session in December 2004. The law, sponsored by state Rep. Kevin DeWine, R-Fairborn, raised campaign contribution limits and put limits on how labor organizations could use dues money for political purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The courts have twice struck down the law: once because the governor, speaker and Senate president signed the wrong version and sent that to the secretary of state and a second time because it included a retroactive provision. Lawmakers then rolled the campaign finance provisions into a budget bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorney general's office has not decided whether to appeal the latest ruling, spokesman Jim Gravelle said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad: &quot;Country I Love,&quot; 60 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Producer: Barack Obama campaign. Where to see it: It begins airing Friday, June 20, in 18 states, including Ohio. View it at DaytonDailyNews.com/ eyeonohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script: &quot;I'm Barack Obama. America is a country of strong families and strong values. My life's been blessed by both. &quot;I was raised by a single mom and my grandparents. We didn't have much money, but they taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland where they grew up. Accountability and self-reliance. Love of country. Working hard without making excuses. Treating your neighbor as you'd like to be treated. &quot;It's what guided me as I worked my way up - taking jobs and loans to make it through college. &quot;It's what led me to pass up Wall Street jobs and go to Chicago instead, helping neighborhoods devastated when steel plants closed. &quot;That's why I passed laws moving people from welfare to work, cut taxes for working families and extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I approved this message because I'll never forget those values, and, if I have the honor of taking the oath of office as president, it will be with a deep and abiding faith in the country I love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: The ad opens with video of Obama sitting in a living room wearing a sport coat and soft guitar music playing. It cuts to childhood photos of Obama and then footage of him hugging a supporter, meeting with workers around a kitchen table and shaking hands with a soldier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: The ad is a biographical piece that introduces the candidate to voters, emphasizing hard work, personal responsibility and humble roots. Obama all but puts on work boots and goes to a construction site to show what a regular guy he is. The ad leaves out some of the exotic and elite biographical details: a father from Kenya, part of his childhood spent in Indonesia and a law degree from Harvard University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from being a personal introduction, Obama tells viewers that he loves his country. This is in response to the fact that Sen. John McCain's campaign ads have focused on his time as a POW and his status as a Vietnam War hero. In addition, Obama's wife, Michelle, has been hammered for making a statement that this year was the first time she has been proud of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle Obama this week appeared on The View, a talk show popular with women, to say, among other things, that she is proud of this country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sierra Club said Thursday it will endorse Democrat Barack Obama for president, a decision it said was made easier by Republican John McCain's support this week of repealing a moratorium on offshore drilling and expanding nuclear power. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The contrast, which was already pretty sharp, just got razor sharp this week,&quot; the environmental group's executive director, Carl Pope, told The Associated Press. &quot;At the end of the day, John McCain just signed up with the Bush policy of giving the oil industry what it wants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A formal announcement by the Sierra Club was scheduled Friday in Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign earlier this week unveiled an ad touting his environmental record, which includes his support for a mandatory reduction in greenhouse gases to reduce global warming. President Bush and most Republicans oppose requiring a reduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many environmental groups held off on endorsing presidential candidates in the 2008 election until the Democratic primary was over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, Friends of the Earth came out in support of Obama after initially backing former Sen. John Edwards for the Democratic nomination. The group said its decision was made when Obama opposed a gas tax holiday supported by McCain and Democratic Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The League of Conservation Voters and Defenders of Wildlife have yet to announce their endorsements.</SPAN></P>

If you missed Broadway's big night, &quot;In the Heights&quot; won for best musical. Wirdzek even stole a bit of that thunder when he warned the folks who live somewhere called Cranberry Heights that high winds were on the way. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LENGTH: 30 seconds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AIRING: National cable and broadcast markets in Colorado, Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Iowa. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCRIPT: Announcer: &quot;John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming, five years ago. Today, he has a realistic plan that will curb greenhouse gas emissions. A plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment. Reform. Prosperity. Peace. John McCain.&quot; McCain: &quot;I'm John McCain and I approve this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KEY IMAGES: Jarring music and a quick black and white succession of video images heavy traffic, smokestacks belching smoke, glaciers collapsing into the ocean, capped by a color clip of the sun setting. McCain then appears on screen behind a microphone above a superimposed newspaper headline: &quot;McCain climate views clash with GOP.&quot; The music softens amid images of windmills, water turbines and solar panels. The ad concludes with McCain outdoors, pines and mountains behind him as a breeze ruffles his untucked shirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANALYSIS: The ad is built on a foundation of five central words: &quot; ... stood up to the president.&quot; Democrats have been trying to portray the Republican presidential candidate as an extension of President Bush. McCain and the Bush administration have clashed over how to control greenhouse emissions. And with McCain embracing Bush's current policies on the Iraq war and tax cuts, the issue of climate change gives him a chance to distance himself from the unpopular president. McCain has favored a plan that would see greenhouse gas emissions cut by 60 percent by 2050 and supports more nuclear power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ad aired a day after McCain's announcement Monday that, like Bush, he favors lifting the federal moratorium on offshore drilling. The announcement, a reversal from his position in his first presidential campaign in 2000, when he said he favored the ban, upset environmental groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also had indicated he was open to a windfall profits tax on the oil industry, but on Tuesday criticized Democratic rival Barack Obama for demanding the same thing. The Democratic National Committee criticized McCain's environmental record, noting his policy changes and some votes against tax credits for alternate energy sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second ad in McCain's expanded general election media campaign. The first described his family's tradition of military service and his more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. If there is a narrative in the ads it is to establish his biography as a war hero and independent politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain currently has the airwaves to himself. Obama has yet to begin broadcasting his general election themes. McCain is spending at least $2 million a week on the ads, a modest expenditure that focuses on key battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain often has said he aspires to be as great a conservationist as his role model and fellow Republican, Theodore Roosevelt. While the ad sought to assure independent and environmentally conscious voters, global warming also stands as an important issue with the evangelical and Christian conservative voters McCain is trying to court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major labor union and the liberal organization MoveOn.org are joining forces to air a provocative new ad portraying John McCain's Iraq policy as a prolonged presence that would involve a new generation of Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paid for by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and by MoveOn.org, the commercial represents an expansion by Democratic-leaning groups of a campaign against McCain. It also targets one of McCain's major assets his public credibility on national security issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad will begin airing nationally Wednesday on CNN and MSNBC, and in Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin markets. It will run for a week at a cost of $543,000. In the ad, an actress with an infant child speaks as if she were addressing McCain, the likely Republican presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hi John McCain,&quot; she says. &quot;This is Alex. And he's my first. So far his talents include trying any new food and chasing after our dog. That, and making my heart pound every time I look at him. And so, John McCain, when you say you would stay in Iraq for 100 years, were you counting on Alex? Because if you were, you can't have him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has stressed that his goal is to reduce American casualties, shift security missions to Iraqis and, ultimately, have a non-combat U.S. troop presence in Iraq similar to that in South Korea. He has speculated that such a presence could last 100 years or more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, McCain aired his own commercial where he asserts, &quot;I hate war.&quot; The ad is biographical, recalling his family's military service and his more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign referred questions about the ad to the Republican National Committee, which said the country needs a president who listens to his commanders, not partisan groups like MoveOn.org. &quot;Bringing peace and security to Iraq will require a commander in chief who won't allow partisanship to cloud his judgment,&quot; said spokesman Alex Conant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show that while a large majority of the public opposes the war, they split almost evenly between McCain and his likely Democratic opponent, Sen. Barack Obama, over who would better handle Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ad aims to give voice to so many people who are frustrated that we seem to be stuck in Iraq,&quot; said Eli Pariser, MoveOn.org's executive director. &quot;It speaks to the worry that people have that we'll be sending another generation of young men and women to Iraq if we continue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFSCME-MoveOn effort unites two forces that were on opposite camps during the Democratic primary. AFSCME backed Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, while MoveOn backed Obama, who clinched the nomination this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Booth, executive assistant to AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee, said the union has not yet endorsed Obama but said the ad illustrates &quot;progressive forces coming together of the same mind about McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MoveOn and AFSCME are paying for the ads through federally regulated political action committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama does not accept financial contributions from political action committees. He has called on outside nonprofit groups not to air ads in the presidential campaign. But his admonition has been aimed at groups that receive unlimited contributions, mostly from wealthy individuals. Political action committees, however, are restricted to receiving contributions of no more than $5,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The umpteen months of campaigning and commercials were barely the opening dance number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Ohioans, the real campaign for the White House begins this week with Barack Obama's visit to the Columbus area, the first trip to the state by either candidate now that both have tallied enough delegates for the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio, in case you hadn't heard, is a must-win state on the road to the White House. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, beaten handily by Hillary Rodham Clinton in the state's Democratic primary in March, is on a two-week tour of swing states focusing on economic issues. He'll visit a Columbus nursing home Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement of the trip to Ohio came just a day after Obama's campaign said it would be the first in a generation &quot;to deploy and maintain staff in every single state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a grand pronouncement but as Obama himself points out, not all that surprising. After all, the volunteer network and organizing infrastructure created during the primary on behalf of Obama and Clinton gave him a big step up with the general election under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain, meanwhile, is playing catch-up in Ohio. While Obama had his state headquarters for months needed for the competitive primary the McCain campaign only recently set up shop in Columbus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Paul Lindsey, McCain's Ohio spokesman, also is handling similar duties in Pennsylvania for the campaign. But he downplays the significance of Obama's statement, and said the campaign will have offices throughout the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will have the resources necessary to be successful in Ohio,&quot; Lindsey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While McCain may have some catching up to organizationally, he's got the edge on recent trips to Ohio, which has voted for every successful presidential candidate since 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has been in Ohio three times since clinching the Republican nomination to Youngstown, Cleveland and Columbus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's Obama's first trip to Ohio since visits to suburban Columbus and Nelsonville two days before the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has some patching up to do with women who supported Clinton, a big job in a state where Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland supported her all the way to the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain must improve his jobs message, equally crucial given Ohio's anemic economy and stagnant population growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both also have considerable strengths from Obama's message of change to McCain's emphasis on American values, said Suzanne Marilley, a Capital University political science professor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We may be in for the campaign of our lives,&quot; she said. &quot;You've got two very compelling cases that come right out of the story of American distinctiveness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ohio State Auditor Mary Taylor has interrupted her self-imposed ban on political statements to announce support for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's asking Ohio voters to join &quot;Citizens for McCain,&quot; an effort headed by U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Democrat-turned-Independent, encouraging Americans of all political parties to support McCain's candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor was the only Republican to win a statewide office during the Democrats' 2006 sweep of elected positions. She has kept a low political profile since and focused on her work as the state's top examiner of public financial records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland has been asked so often about his potential to be the next vice president a job he says he doesn't want, and won't take that he's started cracking jokes about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what I'm really pushing for is ambassador to the Bahamas. OK? Now you've gotten it out of me, breaking news, I can read it on the trailer: 'CNN Breaking News: Strickland new ambassador to Bahamas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama and McCain won't have to worry about Ohioans paying attention to speeches about the economy. The Ohio Poll sponsored by the University of Cincinnati finds 53 percent of Ohio residents rated the state's economic conditions as poor and 79 percent said it was getting worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The random telephone poll of 1,340 adults, conducted between May 16 and June 4, has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One day this past January, Mary Kim Titla's parents left their home on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in southeastern Arizona and drove across the desert to Phoenix with a single purpose in mind getting an up-close glimpse of a long shot named Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With them they brought two things: handmade signs that said &quot;Apaches for Obama&quot; and their grandson, Titla's nephew, a third grader. Carefully, they told him why he was there that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This man,&quot; they told the little boy, &quot;is going to make history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the republic, we're hearing it everywhere in recent months, weeks and particularly in the days since Barack Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee: In America, people say, the winds of history are blowing. And many are excited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, history became a buzzword. Jon Stewart mashed up clips of pundits rhapsodizing about history lessons. &quot;Historic Choice: Obama,&quot; trumpeted the Richmond Times-Dispatch, one of many. &quot;Barack Obama enters the history books,&quot; enthused CNN anchor Tony Harris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is one of the most significant moments in American history,&quot; says Francine Childs, who in July 1956, at 14, sat at a Dairy Queen window every day for 30 days until she was served ice cream at the whites-only counter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is the most obvious historical figure. But he, John McCain and Hillary Rodham Clinton have each spent months vehemently rejecting the old ways, promising that change is at hand. Each has professed to be the one to maneuver us through what they all call a pivot point in history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America, this is our moment,&quot; Obama said last week as his winning delegate count became apparent. &quot;This is our time our time to turn the page on the policies of the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But historic moments have everything to do with history both what has happened in the past, and the instant or era when things change. And each of the major candidates this year is deeply connected with some unhappy aspect of our past, and the urge to move on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Barack Obama, it is the American tradition of racial discrimination and finally hurdling it. For Hillary Rodham Clinton, it has been gender inequity and the promise of a woman in the White House. For John McCain, it is the legacy of Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In American history, certain years 1776, 1865 and 2001 among them have revealed themselves as obvious crossroads. But not since 1968 have we had a presidential campaign and candidates that summon so many of the fundamental tensions of our history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's worth asking amid the sense of wonder: Is this election year a pivot point? When we talk about making history, can we really ever learn from our yesterdays? Are there lessons from the past for the candidates to carry into the fall campaign and the administration beyond?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The past is never dead,&quot; William Faulkner, one of America's greatest writers, once wrote. &quot;It's not even past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so it is in America in 2008. We are riding history's unpredictable currents no matter how passionately we want to move on, no matter how much control we think we have, no matter how loudly our would-be leaders insist that tomorrow is where our priorities lie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIUMPHANT HISTORY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is happening in American politics this year is linked, in the oddest of ways, with Commonwealth of Kentucky Death Certificate No. 26469, a bare-bones account of the Nov. 4, 1930, gunshot murder of a 60-year-old &quot;colored&quot; carpenter named Ed Doneghy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ed Doneghy Killed at Louisville Polls,&quot; the Chicago Defender, a black newspaper, reported a couple of days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the Rev. Martin McMickle, 59, of Shaker Heights, Ohio, cannot stop looking at the smeared ink of the words on that death certificate. When McMickle was doing his family history several months ago, he learned of his link to Doneghy and followed up. He found out that the man was killed for trying to register to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in August, 78 years after a lethal gunshot at a Kentucky poll felled a man who wanted to vote, Doneghy's relative, Martin McMickle minister, teacher, civil rights activist will travel to Denver as a delegate to cast a vote for Obama as the Democratic nominee for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pivot point in history? You bet. And not just because of Obama's triumph, either. To McMickle, this is a historic moment because of Clinton and McCain, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Clinton: &quot;I'm also mindful that my mother, who was born in 1914, was born into a country where women did not have the right to vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On McCain: &quot;The whole idea that a person who is a senior citizen but has the energy and the vigor to sustain so far the primary campaign and is on the verge of beginning the general campaign says an awful lot about senior citizens and about when people ought to consider their active life has ended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So,&quot; McMickle says, &quot;I think there's a wonderful biography in all three of them that can be instructive for the broader public: voting rights for African Americans, voting rights for women in America, and the importance of people continuing to live long beyond the artificial time lines of 65 or 70.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This sense of something special afoot with Obama emerging last week as the most visible engine, but also including the other firsts of this unusual primary season is part of why people who have had their own brushes with history feel a sense of it right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have had candidates who are not well known. We've had candidates who are African-American. We have had women. We have had a public which is disaffected from politics. But we've never had them all together. And in that sense, I think that makes it historic,&quot; says Natalie Davis, a political scientist who ran for the U.S. Senate in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul J. Matthews, a retired pharmaceuticals executive in Houston, has seen history and studied it. And he puts Obama's achievement in a very personal context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1967, Matthews was a college student, a black man marching in a green ROTC uniform on a Prairie View A&amp;M campus fired up by the battle for civil rights. He began to wonder about his choice to serve a nation that continued to treat blacks like second-class citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He resolved his doubt by combing through books on military history. There, he found two paragraphs about the famed Buffalo Soldiers the black regiments formed in the wake of the Civil War, comprised of men determined to show their worth as Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It changed his attitude, and Matthews shipped off to Vietnam two years later. He logged 11 months, 29 days in a medical battalion, where he tagged the bodies of war dead and wrote notification letters to their families back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Matthews runs the institution he founded: the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum, a place where people discuss not only blacks' experience in that war but the larger issue how American blacks over the centuries have served a system that scorned them. And now ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so elated that starting from a situation where blacks couldn't serve in the military to the possibility of having a black man as commander in chief. ... That's quite a leap,&quot; he says. &quot;If that's not a teachable moment, we'll never have one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what history provides, says David Anderson: tangible, valuable tools for us all. It offers reserves of strength for a candidate, particularly one like Obama, who owes it to America to be a man of color rather than downplaying his race, Anderson says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson, 78, the great-grandson of an Alabama slave, spends his days portraying Frederick Douglass, the iconic 19th-century abolitionist, in Rochester, N.Y. History, insists Anderson, is not a burden. Just the opposite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't leave it behind,&quot; Anderson says. &quot;It is NOT baggage. It is strength and it is essential knowledge. And the more you have of it, the better you can understand who you are and what you're capable of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After visiting West Africa several years ago, Anderson decided to add something to his name &quot;Sankofa,&quot; a word from the Akan language that translates loosely to &quot;go back and take.&quot; Anderson interprets it to mean this: &quot;Retrieve from the past that which you can use to frame the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Learning from history, in other words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNEASY HISTORY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History, of course, can be a burden. Because the past is not even past. It's still with us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most prominently, Barack Obama faces the heritage of three torturous centuries of racial unease and injustice and continuing racism in some quarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, Hillary Clinton grappled with the benefits and detriments of being a female front-runner. John McCain faces a nation increasingly obsessed with youth and detached from military culture that wonders whether, at 71, he can govern robustly and how relevant his Vietnam POW experience is to today's discourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More generally, America and its past have always had an uneasy relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We fashion elegies to a simpler, more unified and politically pure past yet often brush our real history aside in the name of an optimistic, forward trajectory that is part of the basic American DNA. We are quick with the word &quot;historic,&quot; using it for everything from celebrity trials to new-and-improved snack foods, but rarely do we pause to consider what something historic really is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates don't always help, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see history abused so much in the political process,&quot; says Seth Masket, who spent part of the Clinton administration answering letters sent to the president and fashioning his written communication the written equivalent of a speechwriter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of these historical metaphors are strained, a lot are inaccurate,&quot; says Masket, who now teaches political science at the University of Denver. People's relationship to history, he says, is visceral: &quot;It's an exciting time to be alive, but it's also very scary. People who like the idea of tradition aren't sure what to cling onto anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, there is the uncomfortable feeling that no matter what we do, we can't quite shake off the past. Andreas Killen, for example, surveys 2008 and sees 1973, all over again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The themes in Killen's 2006 book, &quot;1973 Nervous Breakdown: Watergate, Warhol and the Birth of Post-Sixties America,&quot; sound familiar today: an unpopular president presiding over a divisive war; a country full of malaise and nervous energy trying to make sense of the civil rights and women's movements; rising gas prices, a faltering economy and an expanding unease about the government and the American message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A generation later, every single item in that list weighs upon Barack Obama and John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been many moments over the past few years when I've felt like we were reliving the early 1970s,&quot; Killen says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heritage of the early 1970s war, malaise could hamper the next administration &quot;no matter how much of a mandate for change that president has,&quot; Killen says. History isn't always willing to let go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes the intricacies of history can be summed up succinctly. Consider Mary Ann Vecchio, 52, who earned a place in the national consciousness at age 14 in 1970 when her cry of anguish during the National Guard shootings at Kent State was captured by a photographer's lens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her message to the candidates of 2008 is brief. And potent, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What can they learn from the past?&quot; she says. &quot;Don't repeat it. Don't repeat it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPPORTUNITIES FROM HISTORY?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, there is this, too: We are raising a generation less mindful of the American past and its messages than any that came before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, students can graduate from the nation's top 50 colleges and universities without ever taking a course in U.S. history. And the National Geographic-Roper Survey of Geographic Literacy found in 2006 that only 37 percent of young Americans can find Iraq on a map. A recent national news broadcast, showing a screen on the famed 1858 debates between Abraham Lincoln and Sen. Stephen Douglas, put up photos of Lincoln and ... Frederick Douglass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Baby Boomers were forced as college students to take Western Civilization or to take American history. This new generation never had to do any of that,&quot; says Davis, who teaches undergraduates at Birmingham-Southern College in Alabama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These folks are in the moment. They cannot line up three presidents in the 20th century in terms of order,&quot; she says. &quot;They are absolutely ahistorical. .... It's about them the world that surrounds them at that moment. And there's no looking back because they don't know what to be looking for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And of course there is that niggling thing Americans have to deal with every day the ravenous beast called the present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We care about politics. On the other hand, we're not going to spend that much time worrying about it,&quot; says John Hinshaw, a historian at Lebanon Valley College in Pennsylvania. &quot;We're worried about $4 a gallon gas and what's going on in our kids' lives. It's intensely interesting to certain groups, but a lot of it is just not what we do all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet ... there are times when Americans make history, or at least appreciate that they are witnesses to it. Times like 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States of America is an extraordinary country,&quot; Condoleezza Rice said at the State Department the other day, reacting to the flurry of Obama news. &quot;It is a country that has overcome many, many, now years, decades, actually a couple of centuries of trying to make good on its principles. And I think what we are seeing is an extraordinary expression of the fact that 'We the people' is beginning to mean all of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means the Rev. Martin McMickle, staring at a death certificate that chronicles an injustice and preparing to rectify it in some small way. It means Paul J. Matthews and David Anderson, preserving parts of the American past that they believe must be remembered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It means Mary Kim Titla, whose parents journeyed from the reservation to see Obama. Two decades ago, she became the first American Indian TV reporter on the air in Arizona. This year, she is campaigning to be the first American Indian woman ever elected to Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It means Marshall Trimble, a cowboy poet who is also Arizona's state historian. &quot;Young black people or young women, young girls, young boys who say, `Hey, there's hope now. It can actually happen. It just isn't something that my parents talked about or that my school teacher said might happen. It did happen. It actually happened in America.' Think how that's going to provide inspiration to so many people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it means Francine Childs, the black girl at the Dairy Queen counter who grew up into a student activist, professor, author, world traveler. &quot;Did I ever think this would happen?&quot; she says. &quot;It was something I'd always dreamed about, but (I was) never sure I would see that dream fulfilled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is 2008 shaping up to be a historic crossroads? It's always difficult to judge from within; in presidential election years, history is never far away and &quot;historic&quot; flows easily from the lips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this is, most certainly, a teachable moment for the candidates and for the people they presume to lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country defined by fast-forward but never all that adept with rewind, it's a chance to move ahead with real change not merely to leave our national scars behind but to fashion ways to carry them with us. An opportunity to show that we can do more than lose ourselves in our own history; we can find ourselves there, too.</SPAN></P>
