<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REVIEW-JOURNAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today - after years of thinking about the plight of the nation, months of meeting and listening to the candidates in person, weeks of being bombarded by fliers and commercials, and days of going to the polls - Nevadans' choice for the next president will finally be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps never before has Nevada been the focus of so much national political attention as it has this year, from the January caucuses in which 150,000 Nevadans expressed a preference for their parties' presidential nominees - and chose neither Democrat Barack Obama nor Republican John McCain - to a general election season in which the Silver State was hotly contested by both sides from the beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people have had enough. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am fed up with politics to my last nerve,&quot; barked a woman who answered the door - briefly - at a North Las Vegas home visited by two Obama canvassers Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before slamming the door, she said she was planning to vote but hadn't yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half the state's active registered voters cast early or mail-in ballots over the past two weeks. Officials expect total turnout to hit historic highs of more than 80 percent when today's votes are counted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This election is different than anything else we've seen,&quot; Clark County Registrar of Voters Larry Lomax said. &quot;There's so much interest in it. It's hard to believe turnout could get up to 85 percent, but it looks like it will happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lomax expects around 250,000 to vote in Clark County today, putting total turnout at 700,000 of the county's 815,000 voters. In 2004, the biggest election to date, fewer than 550,000 people propelled Clark County to a record 80 percent turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. today, 339 polling places will be open in Clark County, manned by more than 4,000 poll workers staffing more than 4,000 electronic voting machines. Lomax expects things to go smoothly and recommends voters avoid the morning and evening rushes if possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who encounter problems at the polls should ask to speak to the team leader at the location. To find a polling place, voters should consult their sample ballots. Individuals can look up voter registration information online at www.accessclarkcounty.com/elections; or call the election department at 455-VOTE (8683).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidency is not the only choice facing Nevada voters today. Also on the ballot are the state's three seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, where two incumbents, Republican Reps. Jon Porter and Dean Heller, face strong challenges. Voters also are being asked to choose justices for two seats on the state Supreme Court; members of the state Assembly and Senate; two candidates for open seats on the Clark County Commission; and a bevy of local judges and education officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, voters elsewhere will be deciding matters of interest to Nevada's two U.S. senators, who are not on the ballot themselves. Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., has spent a frustrating two years as head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, trying to keep GOP seats from slipping away. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has watched Ensign's task become more difficult as his majority stands to increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the bigger picture, today's election stands to be a referendum on Nevada's political complexion. Will the state remain a bastion of leave-me-alone conservatism, bucking a national tide that has turned against the Republican Party? Or will Nevada's pendulum swing in a more liberal direction, nudged by the demographic changes that have reshaped the American Southwest in recent years?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, most political watchers expect it to be close. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Obama and McCain campaigns, today is a sprint to the finish in an election that has been unfolding in slow motion since early voting began Oct. 18. Both campaigns have competed madly for Nevadans' attention. McCain and running mate Sarah Palin made the state their last stop before returning to their home states, Arizona and Alaska, on Monday night. Obama made his 20th trip here on Saturday, and his wife, Michelle, held a rally in North Las Vegas on Monday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the McCain campaign's West Coast regional headquarters in Henderson, three men picked up a folder and set out in a car: Las Vegan Howard Curtis, 60; 43-year-old Christopher May, a McCain constituent from Scottsdale, Ariz.; and Mark Turina, 23, who lives in Los Angeles but is here to pound the pavement for five days because &quot;I am very passionate about McCain being our president for three reasons: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They arrived at Canyon Willow Pecos Condominiums near Pecos and Russell roads, a &quot;55 and over community.&quot; Their folder presented them with a baffling list of condo numbers. At No. 101, an Obama flier already hung from the door handle. &quot;That shows you what's going on in Nevada this season, doesn't it?&quot; May cracked as he hung a McCain flier over it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At another unit, a man wearing shorts and his wife both said they'd changed their minds and voted for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, at the second-to-last condo on their list, 82-year-old Ann Armstrong told them, &quot;You've got three votes here. My husband, my daughter and me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the Las Vegas Valley, in the neighborhood where the fed-up woman named Lila slammed the door on the canvassers, there was a bit of a pall over the Obama campaign with the news that the Nevada state director, an effusive New Yorker named Terence Tolbert, had died of a heart attack Sunday night. Tolbert was 44.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was still work to be done for 17-year-old high-school senior Betsy Navarro and 55-year-old Conchita Foster. They set out from a cavernous campaign office off Civic Center Drive north of Lake Mead Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staffer Gaby Baca gave Navarro and Foster their packets - maps of the neighborhood they'd canvass, with lists of names and houses. Like the McCain canvassers, they wouldn't knock on every door, just the ones the campaign's data gurus had highlighted as housing potential Obama voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people spoke Spanish in the neighborhood near Eastern and Washington avenues. Navarro and Foster caught 44-year-old Gloria Torres in her garage, unloading her old Cadillac. In Spanish, she said she had already voted for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gracias, senora,&quot; Foster and Navarro said before moving on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were more than 50 houses on their list. It would take hours. They would need every single vote.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">VISALIA Calif.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting ready to cast her first vote, 19-year-old Elizabeth Jimenez considers all that's at stake in her choice of president: the tanking economy in which she'll start her career. The dwindling medical benefits that support her bedridden sister. The failed promise of immigration reform to help her Mexican-born father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so much bigger than myself,&quot; said the sophomore at College of the Sequoias, in Visalia, Calif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspaper headlines promise layoffs and record the death toll in wars where Jimenez has friends and a cousin. The pressure of keeping her 10-person household afloat threatens her goal of becoming a doctor. The din in the living room where she sleeps and studies makes it hard to do homework. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in spite of the deep uncertainty facing those just starting out in life, young, first-time voters interviewed around the country are eager to participate. Yes, times are tough, they say, but casting a ballot is an act of hope, a bet on a better future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America's always been the place where dreams come true,&quot; says Jimenez, who will become the first in her immigrant family to hang hopes on a ballot. &quot;Our votes can add up, make sure it stays that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Halfway across the country, 21-year-old Sahar Meghani is also upbeat and pragmatic despite the country's gloomy outlook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You just have to go after your own opportunities. They won't come to you,&quot; said the University of Houston finance major, whose dark pantsuit and pearls telegraphed her drive to find a job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying students should &quot;study the candidates just like we study for a test,&quot; she notes that soon &quot;we'll be the ones in control of the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political debut Tuesday for young voters like these comes in an election already marked by historical firsts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young voters broke turnout records. They doubled and in some cases tripled their presence in caucuses like Iowa, energized by the heated contest deciding whether, for the first time, a woman or a black candidate became the Democratic nominee. They responded to intensive youth outreach from Republican and Democratic campaigns by volunteering, and used social networks to amplify their own opinions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In cafes, dorm rooms and at work, they dissected candidates' positions on the economy, the wars, and everything else. In 2008, building on trends in the last two election cycles, the potent mix of personally relevant issues and charismatic candidates could mark the under-25 crowd's breakthrough as political players with clout, experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have factors that will likely result in the highest youth vote on record,&quot; said John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard University's Institute of Politics. Its survey of political attitudes among 18- to 24-year-olds found nearly seven in 10 saw political engagement as an effective way of solving the country's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Sean Barry, a political science major preparing to graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, and start looking for a job come May, sitting on the sidelines was not an option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of us are thinking about jobs after we graduate, what we're going to do about health care,&quot; said the 21-year-old, pushing aside the notes he was studying for a midterm exam. &quot;I'm definitely concerned about the economy, about the war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He'll cast his first vote for president for Sen. Barack Obama, but he's already done a lot more. He went to New Hampshire for the primary contest, worked the phones from California to reach voters in states where Obama needed a boost, and drove to Nevada to get out the vote before that state's January caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drive to be a part of politics has peaked this year among students, Barry said, noting it's not just about voting but &quot;stepping up, volunteering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian Osmena, who is graduating from UC Berkeley in December, noticed students' engagement in everything from the long lines streaming from voter registration booths to political discussions that flared up in unexpected places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's something cool about getting involved this year,&quot; said Osmena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A strong supporter of Sen. John McCain his first vote for president was an absentee ballot cast for the Republican candidate Osmena still credits Obama's charisma and his campaign's outreach to young voters with fueling much of that drive to participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osmena noted the grass-roots energy around Obama, and acknowledged of his candidate, &quot;It is harder to be hip and to be cool when you're 72.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many of his generation, Osmena skips over newspapers and television and gets most of his information about politics online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've done a huge amount of organizing using the Internet, and we've used new technology in ways that really captured young voters' attention,&quot; said Kirsten Searer, spokeswoman for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidate's face is ubiquitous on social networking sites like Facebook.com and in YouTube videos. The campaign has relied on text messages to communicate with voters. They stumbled over the initial plan to announce the vice-presidential pick directly to supporters' cell phones and e-mails, but found the short blurbs are an effective way to advertise early voting locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Hysen, 19, a Harvard sophomore, developed a Facebook application that provided voters, many of them young, with similar reminders. &quot;It's just a lot easier to get involved in politics,&quot; he said. &quot;The stakes are higher than they've been before. This will probably be one of the most important elections of our lifetime, and it's our first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Internet tools and texting have made it simple and cheap to reach young voters, what holds their attention is the reality waiting for graduates as soon as they're handed their diplomas or already facing young voters who moved straight into the job market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nineteen-year-old Daniel Lipps works full time at a restaurant in Portland, Maine. It's not a dream job, but it pays the bills. He's frustrated watching Congress bail out investment banks. &quot;They're just kind of throwing money away,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really want to see some changes,&quot; said Lipps, who in his first vote is leaning toward Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emerging from an Army recruiting center in a Raleigh, N.C., strip mall, Lee Watson, 20, wore a broad smile. He'd made his decision and looked forward to taking his oath as a soldier. He's long planned to follow his father into the Army, and even two ongoing wars weren't enough to change his mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic crisis only reinforced his decision. A KFC restaurant where he'd recently worked in Alabama closed down. On the drive up to North Carolina, Watson was struck by the number of homeless and panhandlers he saw along the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The military is something that'll never go out of business. So I'm never worried about being unemployed now,&quot; he said, standing beside a window festooned with posters offering &quot;Great Educational Benefits&quot; and cash bonuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watson cast an absentee ballot for McCain. As a black man, he knows some might expect him to vote for Obama, but he wanted his first vote to go to &quot;someone who's at least served in a military branch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having a job already lined up at their family farms didn't completely ease the worries of two first-time Iowa voters who remain undecided, unsure which candidate has the interests of agriculture in mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correy Rahn, an Iowa State University senior, will return to his family's Illinois farm to raise cattle and grow corn, soybeans and alfalfa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main issue I would be concerned about is acquiring financial support at a low interest rate,&quot; Rahn said. With credit tight, he may well have to look to older generations for help getting started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chet Hollingshead, also an ISU senior, is heading back to his family's 1,500-acre farm in Ogden, Iowa, to raise hogs, cattle, soybeans and corn when he graduates. McCain, he says, didn't make many friends in Iowa with his pledge to cut food prices by eliminating ethanol subsidies and tariffs on imported ethanol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without those important tax credits, the ethanol industry wouldn't have gotten off the ground,&quot; Hollingshead said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stumbling stock markets, shrinking credit, a monster bailout for the financial sector young voters know the outlook is grim as they start careers and families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But buddies Nathaniel Jones and Alex Hurst, both 20, chatting after class near the intersection of Success Way and Ability Drive at the Wake Technical Community College in Raleigh, weren't daunted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, the economy's doing terribly right now,&quot; said Jones, who is voting for McCain. &quot;I have several friends who've lost jobs because of it. But I think the only way the economy can go is up right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hurst, who is going for Obama, took the long view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historically, this was bound to happen,&quot; he said of the economic crisis. &quot;And, historically, we always work it out. It will work out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contributing to this story were Allen G. Breed in Raleigh, Monica Rhor in Houston, Clarke Canfield in Portland, Maine, and Nigel Duara in Iowa City.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have factors that will likely result in the highest youth vote on record,&quot; said John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard University's Institute of Politics. Its survey of political attitudes among 18- to 24-year-olds found nearly seven in 10 saw political engagement as an effective way of solving the country's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Sean Barry, a political science major preparing to graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, and start looking for a job come May, sitting on the sidelines was not an option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of us are thinking about jobs after we graduate, what we're going to do about health care,&quot; said the 21-year-old, pushing aside the notes he was studying for a midterm exam. &quot;I'm definitely concerned about the economy, about the war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He'll cast his first vote for president for Sen. Barack Obama, but he's already done a lot more. He went to New Hampshire for the primary contest, worked the phones from California to reach voters in states where Obama needed a boost, and drove to Nevada to get out the vote before that state's January caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drive to be a part of politics has peaked this year among students, Barry said, noting it's not just about voting but &quot;stepping up, volunteering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian Osmena, who is graduating from UC Berkeley in December, noticed students' engagement in everything from the long lines streaming from voter registration booths to political discussions that flared up in unexpected places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's something cool about getting involved this year,&quot; said Osmena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A strong supporter of Sen. John McCain his first vote for president was an absentee ballot cast for the Republican candidate Osmena still credits Obama's charisma and his campaign's outreach to young voters with fueling much of that drive to participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osmena noted the grass-roots energy around Obama, and acknowledged of his candidate, &quot;It is harder to be hip and to be cool when you're 72.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many of his generation, Osmena skips over newspapers and television and gets most of his information about politics online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've done a huge amount of organizing using the Internet, and we've used new technology in ways that really captured young voters' attention,&quot; said Kirsten Searer, spokeswoman for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidate's face is ubiquitous on social networking sites like Facebook.com and in YouTube videos. The campaign has relied on text messages to communicate with voters. They stumbled over the initial plan to announce the vice-presidential pick directly to supporters' cell phones and e-mails, but found the short blurbs are an effective way to advertise early voting locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Hysen, 19, a Harvard sophomore, developed a Facebook application that provided voters, many of them young, with similar reminders. &quot;It's just a lot easier to get involved in politics,&quot; he said. &quot;The stakes are higher than they've been before. This will probably be one of the most important elections of our lifetime, and it's our first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Internet tools and texting have made it simple and cheap to reach young voters, what holds their attention is the reality waiting for graduates as soon as they're handed their diplomas or already facing young voters who moved straight into the job market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nineteen-year-old Daniel Lipps works full time at a restaurant in Portland, Maine. It's not a dream job, but it pays the bills. He's frustrated watching Congress bail out investment banks. &quot;They're just kind of throwing money away,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really want to see some changes,&quot; said Lipps, who in his first vote is leaning toward Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emerging from an Army recruiting center in a Raleigh, N.C., strip mall, Lee Watson, 20, wore a broad smile. He'd made his decision and looked forward to taking his oath as a soldier. He's long planned to follow his father into the Army, and even two ongoing wars weren't enough to change his mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic crisis only reinforced his decision. A KFC restaurant where he'd recently worked in Alabama closed down. On the drive up to North Carolina, Watson was struck by the number of homeless and panhandlers he saw along the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The military is something that'll never go out of business. So I'm never worried about being unemployed now,&quot; he said, standing beside a window festooned with posters offering &quot;Great Educational Benefits&quot; and cash bonuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watson cast an absentee ballot for McCain. As a black man, he knows some might expect him to vote for Obama, but he wanted his first vote to go to &quot;someone who's at least served in a military branch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having a job already lined up at their family farms didn't completely ease the worries of two first-time Iowa voters who remain undecided, unsure which candidate has the interests of agriculture in mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correy Rahn, an Iowa State University senior, will return to his family's Illinois farm to raise cattle and grow corn, soybeans and alfalfa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main issue I would be concerned about is acquiring financial support at a low interest rate,&quot; Rahn said. With credit tight, he may well have to look to older generations for help getting started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chet Hollingshead, also an ISU senior, is heading back to his family's 1,500-acre farm in Ogden, Iowa, to raise hogs, cattle, soybeans and corn when he graduates. McCain, he says, didn't make many friends in Iowa with his pledge to cut food prices by eliminating ethanol subsidies and tariffs on imported ethanol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without those important tax credits, the ethanol industry wouldn't have gotten off the ground,&quot; Hollingshead said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stumbling stock markets, shrinking credit, a monster bailout for the financial sector young voters know the outlook is grim as they start careers and families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But buddies Nathaniel Jones and Alex Hurst, both 20, chatting after class near the intersection of Success Way and Ability Drive at the Wake Technical Community College in Raleigh, weren't daunted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, the economy's doing terribly right now,&quot; said Jones, who is voting for McCain. &quot;I have several friends who've lost jobs because of it. But I think the only way the economy can go is up right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hurst, who is going for Obama, took the long view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historically, this was bound to happen,&quot; he said of the economic crisis. &quot;And, historically, we always work it out. It will work out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contributing to this story were Allen G. Breed in Raleigh, Monica Rhor in Houston, Clarke Canfield in Portland, Maine, and Nigel Duara in Iowa City.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five months and thousands of weddings after California's highest court sanctioned same-sex marriage, anxious eyes around the nation will closely follow voters Tuesday as they decide whether to turn back the clock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the state's size and influence, the vote on a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage has become a referendum on sexual orientation and civil rights. Both sides call it the &quot;Gettysburg&quot; of the power struggle between the gay rights movement and the Christian right, with the victors capturing momentum in other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As California goes, so goes the nation,&quot; Mayor Gavin Newsom boldly predicted at a City Hall celebration the day the state Supreme Court legalized marriages of gays and lesbians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race has tightened over the last six weeks and is expected to be close. A Field Poll released Friday found 49 percent of likely voters oppose the ban and 44 percent favor it. In mid-September, the measure was losing by 17 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the minds of many people, Proposition 8 is the most important thing nationally on the ballot,&quot; said Tony Perkins, president of the Washington-based Family Research Council, which supports the measure. &quot;We have survived bad presidents. But many, many are convinced we will not survive this redefinition of marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious and civil rights groups, wealthy philanthropists and middle-class donors have poured $69 million into campaigns for and against Proposition 8, making the initiative the most expensive election question this year outside the race for the White House. Almost $21 million has come from campaign contributors outside California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the presidential candidates weighed in on Proposition 8: Sen. John McCain endorsed it and Sen. Barack Obama opposed it. Former President Bill Clinton recorded a telephone message that went to millions of California households Friday asking voters to defeat the measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of opinion leaders in the state, including almost every major newspaper, the League of Women Voters, the state NAACP, and moderate politicians such as Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein oppose the measure, which critics say unfairly denies one group a basic right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporations that normally shy from contentious issues also have come out against it. The founders of Google, Yahoo and Adobe Systems took out a newspaper ad Friday encouraging Silicon Valley residents to reject it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the most intense and expensive social issues fight we have ever seen. And I think the real reason is because it's very rare in American life (that) we have ever put existing rights on the ballot,&quot; said Patrick Guerriero, a former leader of the gay Log Cabin Republicans who now directs the &quot;No on 8&quot; campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the measure's opponents have found a formidable foe in the coalition of religious and social conservatives who sponsored the initiative. Since leaders of the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints appealed to members to back the ban, Mormon dollars and volunteers have streamed into California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L. Whitney Clayton, the church's liaison with a coalition called ProtectMarriage.com, said the religious right and Mormons see a threat to the fundamental underpinnings of their faiths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The impact upon society over the long run is something that makes people very apprehensive,&quot; Clayton said. &quot;What will our children be taught in school? What will happen to the freedom of religion? What will people be able to preach and believe, and will they be able to do the things that they are accustomed to doing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California Roman Catholics, at the urging of bishops, also have stepped up with money and manpower, as have evangelical Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative's backers contend that people of faith will be forced to embrace same-sex marriage if the ban loses, and teachers will be required to inform children about gay relationships, an assertion denounced by state education officials. They also argue that opponents of same-sex marriage are unjustifiably being painted as bigots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measure, which would change the California Constitution to limit marriage to a woman and a man, marks the first time voters have been asked to ban same-sex unions retroactively. If passed, it would overrule the state Supreme Court decision in May that said preventing gays from marrying was unlawful discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many couples have hurried to tie the knot before Election Day despite uncertainty over whether their unions would remain valid if voters approve the measure. Attorney General Jerry Brown has already opined that the ban would not be retroactive, but legal scholars have expressed uncertainty and said the matter would almost certainly be litigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond what that might mean for already married couples, the measure's adoption or rejection could affect the pace at which other state courts and legislatures move to legalize same-sex marriage. Depending on how the vote goes, it could also reinvigorate efforts to get Congress to consider a law extending nondiscrimination workplace protections to gays and lesbians or a federal constitutional gay marriage ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gay couples are expected to begin marrying this month in Connecticut, the third state after Massachusetts and California to allow same-sex weddings. The Iowa Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in a similar case next month. Meanwhile, gay rights activists have been lobbying lawmakers in New York, New Jersey and New Hampshire to take up marriage legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If those who favor man marrying man were to win in California, it would be a big boost to their movement and a big loss to our efforts to preserve the definition of marriage as its always been known in our country and Western civilization,&quot; said Tim Wildmon, president of the Mississippi-based American Family Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A setback for same-sex marriage in California would deprive the gay rights movement of the opportunity to show mainstream America what happens when gay couples can marry, said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter where you sit in this country, it moves the hearts and minds of all when we have a big slice of the nation to watch and see gay people can get married and not one thing has changed,&quot; Solmonese said. &quot;Those dire warnings about the end of the world as we know it just aren't coming true.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leave it to Review-Journal columnist Jane Ann Morrison to illuminate Las Vegans to the horror of attending a Sarah Palin rally as a member of the liberal media elite (Oct. 23 column). Those nasty &quot;white&quot; Republicans with &quot;a smattering of minorities&quot; and &quot;one Mexican-American Catholic&quot; had the nerve to shout &quot;move the cameras&quot; to the media. Never mind that Ms. Morrison and her media peers arrived late and blocked the view of those Republicans who came early. How dare these Republicans expect to catch a glimpse of their vice presidential candidate!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Morrison and her friends were there to do their job - bash Republicans. How can we expect Ms. Morrison and her peers to respect the rights of those with opposing viewpoints when there is an election to be won? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We forgive you, Ms. Morrison. Your disappointment at not hearing any &quot;racial epithets&quot; is palpable. That column would have written itself. How discouraging it must be to anticipate such lawlessness and bigotry for your big column, only to come away with nothing but reasonable people asking you to not rudely block their views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next time you wrongly fantasize about &quot;getting the ever lovin' crap beat out of you&quot; should you wear a Barack Obama button to the Republican rally, as you so pretentiously &quot;contemplated,&quot; try to remember how wrong your presumptions about Republicans were this time. In one of those humorous ironies, the only presumptions you did manage to prove was that you and your media peers do not need Obama buttons to advertise your politics, and the aforementioned liberal media are indeed so elitist that they believe it appropriate to impede the views of others.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third-World paradise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Review-Journal columnist Vin Suprynowicz wants to live in a place where there's no Medicare, no income tax, no speed limits and you can carry a machine gun around (Sunday, &quot;We want regulation! It makes us safer!&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have news for you, Mr. Suprynowicz: Places like that already exist. They are called The Third World.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please do many of us a favor by packing your bags and leaving this &quot;socialist&quot; country you seem to detest so much and moving to an African country where there are no pesky medical regulations preventing you from calling for the voodoo doctor of your choice, and where even teenagers can roam the streets carrying machine guns. Is Africa too far away? Then try Haiti, Mr. Suprynowicz.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain as Scrooge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never taking his constituency for granted, Santa Claus appears at the mall every holiday season, campaigning for a Christmas that most Americans will celebrate anyway. Sen. John McCain, however, prescribes to a different philosophical view. He has essentially chosen to skip the traditionally red state of Nevada in his campaign, not stopping by to yuck it up about the 45 nuclear power plants that he intends to build so Nevadans can sleep peacefully next to the waste-hauling, straight-talk express.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess Sen. McCain doesn't understand that we Nevadans live typically in one home - not nine, in this traditionally red state - and that we know firsthand that the fundamentals of the economy are not strong, because unlike past holidays, save for those of us fortunate to land a job wearing a red suit, we do not plan to frequent the mall as much this forthcoming season. Rather, we have developed an early list that requires very little shopping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, all we want for Christmas is our two front teeth, a job with medical relief and a picture of our next president, Barack Obama, gift-wrapped under the tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vernard Williams</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Las Vegas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Happy Halloween</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation will celebrate Halloween today. As usual, children in their favorite &quot;scary&quot; costumes will be knocking on doors, trick-or-treating for sweets and other goodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a night of childish fun enhanced by consumerism and the onslaught of commercialism. Probably most have forgotten or don't even know the origin of Halloween: the vigil of All Saints Day, a memorial for the saints and the dead who have gone before us. Today, business and material interests have turned this annual feast into a masquerade for the young - and a sales bonanza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witness the rows and rows of store shelves and aisles filled with ghoulish costumes, horror house props and plastic skulls - most, if not all, of course, made in China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I surmise the Chinese who make the stuff must wonder: &quot;What in the world are those crazy Americans doing with all that crap?&quot; Only in America!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JESS CARLOS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAS VEGAS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FINAL WORD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will not be a perfect president. But I can promise you this - I will always tell you what I think and where I stand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama in a campaign ad aired simultaneously on seven networks Wednesday night. Sen. Obama, left, no longer grants interviews to individual journalists, routinely dodged questions in debates with GOP Sen. John McCain by responding with excerpts from unrelated stump speeches, and effectively blacklisted an Orlando, Fla., TV station after one of its reporters posed tough questions to running mate Joe Biden - questions Sen. Biden refused to answer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call invariably comes at night typically right at dinner time or prime time: A prerecorded voice promotes a candidate or initiative, or issues a stinging criticism of the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, the so-called robocalls are as annoying as they are ubiquitous at election time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also happen to be illegal in California. That has hardly stopped campaigns and candidates from exploiting legal loopholes to use them, including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has recorded one himself, and the redistricting initiative he supports, Proposition 11, also is using them. Dozens of others, including legislative and congressional candidates, are ramping up their use of automated calls in the final days of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technically, it is illegal for campaigns and companies to send automated messages to Californians unless a live person introduces the call and asks for permission to play the message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robocalls that come from out-of-state call centers aren't subject to the rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vast majority of campaigns if not all of them use that tactic because the agency that oversees telephone communications, the California Public Utilities Commission, can regulate only calls initiated inside the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission does virtually nothing to enforce its own regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a prerecorded message this week on behalf of San Ramon Mayor Abram Wilson, Schwarzenegger tells voters in the 15th Assembly District in the eastern San Francisco Bay area that Wilson's &quot;financial management skills are sorely needed in the Legislature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson's campaign manager, Matthew Del Carlo, makes no apologies. He notes that Wilson's opponent, Democrat Joan Buchanan, also is using robocalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great way of letting people know about Abram Wilson and that the governor's endorsing him,&quot; Del Carlo said. &quot;If they weren't effective, we wouldn't be doing them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Del Carlo said he did not know where the calls originate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abram campaign paid a company called politicalcalling.com to make its robocalls. A man who answered the phone at the company, based in Davis, a university town just west of Sacramento, said all its calls are generated outside California. He declined to give his name or make a company spokesman available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Buchanan campaign has paid a Lowell, Mass.-based firm for its robocalls, according to campaign finance reports filed with the Secretary of State's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because they're automated, the calls are a relatively cheap way to reach large numbers of voters. Campaigns also use them to target particular groups of voters that might be inclined to support their candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former state Sen. Dede Alpert questions whether the calls work. Alpert, who is campaigning for Proposition 11, said she has recorded many of the messages herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that mostly they're annoying,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm not sure they're terribly effective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Alpert said she was among those who did not know the calls aren't allowed by the Public Utilities Commission unless they're made by call centers located out of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said clarity is needed in the rules governing the calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There also is little evidence that the Public Utilities Commission, whose members are appointed by the governor, does anything to intervene when consumers complain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission spokeswoman Susan Carothers said the agency has had 45 &quot;consumer contacts&quot; this year about robocalls. She said the callers are urged to contact their telephone carrier about the problem. She said she could not immediately provide further information about the consumers' complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency has had only one formal investigation into robocalls, a 2004 complaint from an SBC customer over an illegal automated call, Carothers said. SBC California was ordered to &quot;contact the offending party&quot; an unnamed political campaign to educate its contractor about the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Robocallers are not regulated companies. The fact that commercial businesses and political-nonprofit organizations generate the calls (quite possibly out of state) instead of the carriers that we regulate makes enforcement a challenge,&quot; Carothers said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California law allows a fine of up to $500 or disconnection of a phone line for violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robocalls are getting attention this year for reasons beyond regulatory concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain was criticized for using automated calls in swing states linking Democrat Barack Obama to former 1960s radical William Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in California's 1st Congressional District, which stretches from north of Sacramento to the state's northern coastline, about 100,000 would-be voters received a breathy, sexually suggestive robocall this week from the campaign of long-shot Republican challenger Zane Starkewolf, 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a whispering voice, a woman urged voters to back Starkewolf, saying U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, a Democrat, has &quot;been a bad boy.&quot; The message ended with a climactic &quot;Vote YES for Zane!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 4th Congressional District race in Northern California, Democrat Charlie Brown filed a complaint Thursday over robocalls from the campaign of Republican Tom McClintock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint to the Federal Election Commission accused McClintock of failing to include a federally required disclaimer that states who paid for the automated call. McClintock spokesman Bill George dismissed the complaint as &quot;a desperate ploy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Hefner, a spokesman for the campaign opposing the redistricting initiative, criticized robocalls from the Schwarzenegger-backed campaign even if all campaigns do it. He said Schwarzenegger should be held to the highest standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The governor is paying for those calls that are both misleading and illegal on the face of it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proposition 11 spokeswoman Molly Weedn said the campaign's calls are not illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our calls weren't subject to PUC jurisdiction because they originated out of state,&quot; Weedn said. She could not say where the calls originated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hefner's own firm, Polka Consulting, has taken advantage of the same legal loophole. Earlier this year, its campaign to recall Republican state Sen. Jeff Denham paid a Jackson, Miss., company more than $30,000 to make automated calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hefner acknowledged the contradiction. He said the firm has since stopped making robocalls after learning they are prohibited unless they are made out of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm doing four campaigns this year and we're not doing robocalls for a single one,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's spot-check. Bearing down on E Day, three half-hour newscasts on KTNV-TV, Channel 13, KVBC-TV, Channel 3 and KLAS-TV, Channel 8, sampled at random recently, divvied up election stories this way: Channel 13, two stories on the prez campaign, one on local races, but hey, as a consolation, there were 14 political ads; Channel 3, three prez stories, no local, 12 ads; Channel 8, three prez stories, no local, two &quot;in-their-own words&quot; spiels from local candidates (admirable, but it's more free ad time than news coverage) and 10 ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some stories are tagged for selected newscasts so coverage fluctuates, but the pattern doesn't. Beyond linchpins like &quot;Nevada Week in Review&quot; and Vegas' Great White Shark of Political Journalism, Jon Ralston, story count is fairly dismal day to day. It's not that they aren't there.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts have predicted that new voters, young voters and Hispanic voters will turn out in record numbers in this election. But as Nevadans continue to flock to the polls, turnout among those three groups is lagging, at least in the early going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While turnout statewide was nearly 25 percent through Sunday, it was just 20 percent among Hispanic voters, 14 percent among voters under 30 and 15 percent among those who didn't vote in the last three elections, according to an analysis of state early voting records through Sunday prepared by America Votes, an organization that works to mobilize voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data provide a glimpse into the composition of the more than 300,000 Nevadans who had taken advantage of early voting over the first nine days of the 14-day period. The information comes from proprietary databases that political action groups purchase from commercial vendors, cross-referenced with the public data the state releases showing who has voted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditionally, older people, whites and people who vote consistently tend to turn out at the highest rates overall, said David Damore, a political scientist at UNLV. But this year, much has been made of the idea that the youth vote, the Hispanic vote and first-time voters would turn out at unprecedented rates, galvanized by a heightened political climate and the candidacy of Democratic nominee Barack Obama.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would have expected those numbers to be a little higher,&quot; Damore said. &quot;At the same time, the people who come out for early voting may tend to be the tried and true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that the electorate will be radically reshaped this year remains an open question, he said, and it's possible the Obama campaign faces a challenge turning out the untested voters it's relying on to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent polling shows Obama leading in the Silver State by varying margins. Democrats' hopes have been boosted by a tectonic shift in voter registration that has left them with more than 110,000 more registered voters than Republicans, but the GOP insists there's hope because the election will be decided by who votes and how.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What Republicans have been saying is that registration is only half the game, and they have the tried and true model to get people out,&quot; Damore said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Hilda Solis, D-Calif., was in Las Vegas on Tuesday working to rally Hispanic voters for Obama. She said she expects high Hispanic turnout this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of them are registering to vote for the first time; they may be immigrants, and many are not familiar with the process here,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An important part of the Obama campaign's outreach to Latinos is clarifying how voting works, she said: making sure they understand that filling out a registration form is not the same as casting a vote, that early votes count just like votes on Election Day, and that they cannot vote over the phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deceptive phone calls targeting Hispanic Obama supporters in Nevada have tried to trick them into &quot;voting&quot; by phone and not going to the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early voting turnout continues to be high overall. Through the end of voting Monday, more than 334,000 voters had cast ballots statewide, including 242,000 in Clark County and 59,000 in Washoe County. Statewide turnout is up to 29 percent, according to the secretary of state's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the urban counties, Democrats continue to turn out at higher rates than Republicans. In Clark County, 54 percent of those who voted through Monday were Democrats, 29 percent Republicans. In Washoe County, 51 percent of voters through Monday were Democrats, while 33 percent were Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Partisan statistics were not available for the 15 rural counties, home to less than 15 percent of the electorate, which tend to be heavily Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a Las Vegas early voting site on Tuesday, the effects of high turnout were clearly visible. About 25 people waited in line to get into a trailer on the grounds of the Las Vegas Athletic Club near the intersection of Sahara Avenue and Decatur Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I haven't voted since I was 18, but it's time to start making a difference,&quot; said Denise Farrell, a 42-year-old black woman with braided hair who had just gotten off her graveyard shift as a housekeeping manager at a Strip resort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she was voting for Obama because &quot;he's focusing on the middle class, not so much the rich. They're already rich. They don't need help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Janet Soldan, a 56-year-old real estate agent who is white, said she's a registered Republican who has never voted Democratic before, but this year, &quot;I just want change. I just don't feel we can take it any longer. It's time to try something new.&quot; She, too, said she voted for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Collopy also said he was voting for change, but in his case that meant McCain. The 50-year-old white man, a Las Vegas limo driver, said he considers himself a conservative Republican, &quot;but I'm not a happy Republican. I think McCain's going to be President Bush all over again, and I'm not a fan of Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collopy said he's concerned that the government spends too much money and doesn't pay any attention to the little guy. He was disgusted by the Wall Street bailout. But he said he figured McCain was the lesser of two evils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three new polls released this week find Obama with a lead over Republican John McCain in Nevada. A Rasmussen Reports poll released Tuesday put Obama at 50 percent, McCain at 46 percent. The automated poll of 700 likely voters was conducted Monday and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poll conducted by Boston's Suffolk University and also released Tuesday found a bigger lead for Obama: He had 50 percent of the vote to McCain's 40 percent. That poll of 450 likely voters was conducted Thursday through Monday and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 4.6 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poll Zogby International released Monday put Obama at 48 percent and McCain at 44 percent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend's rallies by Barack Obama, both here in Nevada and in the Intermountain West, were remarkable considering the landscape of the electoral map hanging in my office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2004 election results are as damning to progressives as suffering under eight years of George W. Bush. The map isn't just the red state-blue state one everyone has seen, it's a look at the presidential race in each of the nation's counties. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada has the lightest of blue in Clark County against a red sea elsewhere. Utah, Nebraska, Oklahoma are completely red. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the reality of four years ago, the current map is hard to believe as polling estimates suggesting the Obama-Biden ticket could finish with as many as 375 electoral votes, winning in previously inconceivable places such as Virginia, Colorado and even just Nevada, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's rally Saturday at Bonanza High School had the same purpose as Sarah Palin's rally in Henderson earlier in the week. To use a poker analogy, it's like a huge bet by the big stack at the table designed to show strength and scare the other players out of the pot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this case the rally was designed to show force and numbers as a signal to voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's Sunday declaration that &quot;I'm going to win it&quot; was designed to keep some of his voters energized enough to actually turn out next Tuesday. If you're a Republican outside the Palin camp, it can be daunting to look at national polls suggesting you're ticket is trailing badly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his 19th visit to Nevada, Obama drew an estimated 29,000 voters statewide to his two appearances in Reno and Las Vegas - the smallest crowds of his recent Western swing. Still, his speech at Bonanza was the perfect mix of policy assurances for the undecided and urgent pleas to the faithful to get out and vote and volunteer for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain has been throwing everything he's got at us, including the kitchen sink - all seven of those kitchen sinks,&quot; Obama said. &quot;He's even called me a socialist for suggesting that we focus on tax cuts not for corporations and the wealthy, but for the middle class.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, for his part, was in neighboring Western states before heading to must-win Ohio. His campaign suggests he won't be back in Nevada before Election Day. He hasn't been here since August, when he made a quick stop in Northern Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the strategy will work. McCain can drum up a small crowd with his tax scares, but the average Republican here doesn't like him any better than he does the cross-dressing former mayor of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And trying to win the Hispanic vote with radio ads that suggest he's more liberal than Obama when it comes to immigration doesn't help a bit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the pro-Yucca Mountain forces don't seem to have the numbers to lift him. The Palin voters I've talked with sure are proud of the ticket, hoping Palin can influence policy, judicial selections and even step into the big job herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so while we won't see McCain - or Obama - again, we will probably get the robo messages and the door knockers from neighboring Utah and California where the election results aren't in question. One of McCain's fellow prisoners of war is appearing in a new robo message suggesting, &quot;A weak president, will, indeed, be tested. Obama and Democrats' politics endanger American lives. They are not qualified to lead our military and our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tell that to Gen. Powell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody's out there suggesting McCain is weak for following the most disastrous foreign policy in modern times - policies that have cost thousands of Americans their lives and tens of thousands more their bodies, mental health and families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, as McCain supporter Orson Swindle (I am not making that name up) was making his &quot;weak&quot; assault, Obama was making what his campaign called a closing argument to the people of Ohio, and in a sense, to the rest of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In one week, you can put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election; that tries to pit region against region, city against town, Republican against Democrat; that asks us to fear at a time when we need hope,&quot; Obama said at a rally in Canton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevadans may ultimately see the election the way the Elko Daily Free Press did in an honest endorsement of McCain, offering support for the &quot;man behind the mask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The moderate, reform-minded man of integrity Sen. John McCain, has turned himself into a Frankenstein in order to scare up voters from the Republican base,&quot; the paper wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Obama finishes with the same message he began with: change and hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The electoral map is already starting to accept it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic state Senate candidate Allison Copening used to have an A rating from the National Rifle Association. Not anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pro-gun lobby lowered its grade to B last week after learning that Copening agrees with the slew of independent ads on her behalf that slam her opponent, incumbent Republican Bob Beers, for his proposal to allow grade-school teachers to carry weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrie Herbertson, the NRA's state liaison, said local members wanted to know why Copening deserved an A given all those Democratic Party-sponsored television and mail advertisements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The A was based on Copening's answers to the NRA's candidate questionnaire, which the association keeps confidential but which included a question about guns on campuses. Though the question specified universities, the association believes it should also apply to grades K-12, Herbertson said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of our big issues is allowing concealed carry on university campuses,&quot; Herbertson said. &quot;If you're a trained concealed-carry permit holder, you should be able to carry every&shy;where. Safety is safety, and if anything, our younger kids are more vulnerable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beers, who in 2007 sponsored the gun bill in question, has an A+ rating from the NRA and the group's endorsement. The Democrats' ads call him dangerous for wanting to &quot;allow kindergarten teachers to carry loaded weapons in the classroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herbertson talked to Copening to give her a chance to explain herself and was &quot;disappointed&quot; with her answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously she did not put the ad out, but she did not repudiate it, and if you are not repudiating it, you're endorsing it,&quot; Herbertson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copening said she agrees with the NRA that adults who have concealed weapon permits should be able to take guns onto university campuses, but &quot;there's a vast difference between that and a situation with children. I respect the NRA and their members, but at the very core of my being, I don't believe there should be guns in elementary school classrooms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FROM GUNS TO COPS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone attempting to referee that state Senate race between Beers and Copening would have tired arms and a worn-out whistle by now. Another dispute centers on whether Beers can claim to be supported by law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent mailer to some Beers constituents stamps a &quot;FALSE&quot; legend on one of Beers' own mailers and says, &quot;Senator Beers would like you to believe he has the support of the men and women who put their lives on the line every&shy;day to keep our community safe. But it is simply not true.&quot; The pro-Copening flier is from the Southern Nevada Conference of Police and Sheriffs, or SNCOPS, an umbrella organization of Clark County law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mailer tagged with the &quot;FALSE&quot; stamp features Beers and the badge logo of the Peace Officers Research Association of Nevada, or PORAN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Beers mailer contends, &quot;In the race for state Senate District 6, law enforcement is split. Peace officers endorse state Senator Bob Beers. Unions endorse PR spokeswoman Allison Copening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beers does indeed have PORAN's endorsement, but David Kallas, president of SNCOPS, said he is making too much of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has an endorsement from PORAN, a Northern Nevada group, none of whose officers work in or live in our community,&quot; Kallas said. The &quot;peace officers&quot; of the group's title, he said, include fish and game wardens, cattle brand inspectors and gaming control board agents, but not police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He does not have the support of a single police organization in Clark County for one reason, and that's that he does not support us,&quot; Kallas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beers' crusade against public employee salaries has long drawn the ire of police and other government unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beers said he sees a distinction between police associations that are concerned mainly with salaries, which he sees as essentially labor unions, and those that are &quot;concerned about policy issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PORAN, he said, includes many enforcement agencies that &quot;function statewide,&quot; and he considers them police. &quot;They carry badges and guns,&quot; he said. &quot;They're post certified. To say no police support me is silly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NO JUSTICE FOR ENSIGN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He may be a member of the same political party, but Sen. John Ensign of Nevada didn't mince words last week about what he thinks of President Bush's Department of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an appearance Tuesday at the National Press Club, Ensign lambasted the department's handling of its case against Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who is charged with lying on Senate financial disclosure statements to hide $250,000 in home renovations and other gifts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevens is in a tight race for re-election. Ensign is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and his job is to save Stevens' seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've had this evidence way ahead of time and to wait, and to have this happen right during the election when there's really no time to defend yourself - I thought it was pretty outrageous for our Justice Department to do that,&quot; Ensign said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensign also said the department waited until the last day it could to press charges against Stevens, &quot;and I thought that that was pretty unfair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first time Ensign has lashed out against the Justice Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the senator charged the department &quot;completely mishandled&quot; the dismissal of Daniel Bogden, who was one of seven U.S. attorneys fired in a controversial move that led to the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OF PORK AND PLUNGERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is what they call the silly season in politics, and the campaign of Republican presidential nominee John McCain has cornered the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the campaign is scheduled to hold an &quot;Iron Chef Nevada&quot; competition. Unlike the television show, the two competing chefs, a couple of campaign staffers, know the secret ingredient in advance: It's pork, satirizing Democrat Barack Obama's record on pork-barrel spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past few weeks, the campaign has handed out tire gauges at gas stations labeled &quot;Obama's Energy Plan,&quot; ridiculing the Democrat's suggestion that monitoring tire pressure could save just as much gas as the United States could potentially get from offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has held barbecues with 94-cent hot dogs (in honor of Obama's 94 votes for higher taxes) and $1.30 hot dogs (mocking his nearly 130 &quot;present&quot; votes in the Illinois state Senate). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And lest you forget that Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, once said he thought it was &quot;patriotic&quot; for rich people to pay more taxes, the hot dog and hamburger prices were augmented with a &quot;non-optional Biden patriot tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign spokesman Rick Gorka said, &quot;You try to have as much fun as possible while conveying a serious message. When you get a serious message out there in a tongue-in-cheek manner, that allows it to be more memorable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign held a &quot;Carve for Change&quot; pumpkin-carving event last week, but that's whimsical, not sardonic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokeswoman Kirsten Searer said that there's nothing wrong with lightening things up sometimes, but that the McCain camp's stunts reflected a desperate campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gorka denied that stunts cheapen the political discourse. &quot;We spend a lot of time talking about serious issues,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a way to have a little fun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're interested, the Iron Chef contest is at 6 p.m. today at the campaign's headquarters in Henderson. It's at 8935 S. Pecos Road., near the intersection with Interstate 215.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAS VEGAS </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressman Jon Porter, with his low-key Midwestern temperament and approachable vibe, has the look of a good listener. He certainly does a lot of it these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, to his constituents whose home values are plummeting and jobs disappearing. Then there's his quick-witted opponent, Dina Titus, a longtime Democratic state legislator not known for her short memory or brief remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps loudest is the undeniable din of a district shifting. It's ringing in Porter's ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic registration has surged in Porter's suburban district, fueled by dissatisfaction with President Bush, the Iraq war and, most recently, the implosion of a local economy that runs on tourism and development. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strip malls, gated communities and tract housing that encircle Las Vegas are not what they were when Porter first ran for Congress in 2002 after seven years in the state Legislature and four year as mayor of Boulder City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homes are empty, malls vacant and growth nearly halted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 53-year-old former insurance salesman feels the mood shifting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Go back two weeks and it was energy and gas prices,&quot; Porter said earlier this month. &quot;Then the mortgages were still a priority. ... now we move in to the existing economy challenges, with 401Ks and pensions and businesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this environment, it's changing daily,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not all that's changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Porter was first elected in 2002, Democrats have added 50,000 voters to their rolls in Nevada's 3rd District. The biggest flood came as a result of a high-profile Democratic presidential caucus that inspired the party to begin combing the Las Vegas suburbs for voters two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have not stopped. Democrats have a 30,000-voter lead over Republicans in registration in the district, and they're outpacing GOP turnout at the polls in early voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most opinion polls show the candidates nearly even.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so to hold on to his seat, Porter must hold on to the voters who've left his party, as well as those who wouldn't dream of it. He must separate himself from the reliable Republican foot soldier he was during his party's rule in the House and show leadership on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also must defeat the strongest, best known opponent he's faced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus isn't making the job easy. The 58-year-old political science professor who served in the state Senate since 1989 has kept to sharp and familiar rhetoric. She borrows lines from presidential candidate Barack Obama. She promises change and doesn't miss an opportunity to link Porter to the unpopular president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything is crumbling like a house of cards,&quot; she recently told a crowd of union members. &quot;It's a scary time and that is why we've got to turn this around. We cannot take four more years like the last eight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has funded a massive ad blitz on Titus' behalf. And while the National Republican Congressional Committee is giving up its efforts in other tight districts around the country, it has not abandoned Porter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The congressman often notes he's been targeted like this before. His district was never a Republican safe haven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the recent Democratic surge, it was locked in with nearly equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans, but independents leaned conservative and carried the day. Porter defeated his last opponent by just 4,000 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, Porter has broken ranks with Republican leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first two terms, he supported most major Bush administration efforts, including the Bush tax cuts and the war in Iraq. He sided with hard-liners on immigration reform, and then realigned himself with a more moderate bill. Bush campaigned for Porter in 2006. (Democrats don't miss an opportunity to wave the photos to prove it.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porter has increasingly bucked his party, including voting to override presidential vetoes on bills that would have increased funding for children's health insurance and education. He voted with Democrats on a measures that increased funding for college scholarships and another aimed at preventing discrimination based on sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's so distanced himself from the administration that it came as a surprise to some when Porter stood with his party's leadership earlier this month and voted in favor of the $700 billion bailout package that failed in the House. Titus has said she would have rejected that bill, but supported the subsequent version that passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porter insists his political philosophy has not changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think both parties have some good ideas and both parties have some bad ideas,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus sees Porter shifting with the political winds, and running from his record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to blame everybody else. Who's in charge? You've been there. You have to take some responsibility,&quot; she shot back at a recent debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her message is resounding with voters like Paul Paige. The 41-year-old union carpenter and new registrant was just laid off from his job. He's said he's voting for Obama for president because he wants a change. He's had enough of &quot;old, white guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't seem like Porter is effective. He doesn't seem to do anything, or have any of his own opinions,&quot; Paige said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porter's response to the call for change has been a revival of Republicans' most effective message: promising lower taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His barrage of attack ads accuse Titus of voting to quadruple her state pension 19 years ago, before she qualified for it. Another goes after Titus for voting for a massive tax increase in 2003, although the plan was backed by a Republican governor. Mailers sent by the National Republican Congressional Committee label Titus &quot;Queen of Tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican operative Steve Wark sees Porter's strategy as a more effective version of the one employed by Republican presidential hopeful John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porter is a &quot;a firm anchor in an ever-shifting environment.&quot; Titus is a tax-raising liberal, Wark says, paraphrasing Porter's message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he makes the case better than the presidential campaign. Dina Titus has a much fuller record of fiscal liberalism than Barack Obama, she's served longer,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus, of course, rebuts that characterization, but it's a familiar chorus. In 2006, she lost the race for governor after Republican Jim Gibbons branded her &quot;Dina Taxes.&quot; After two campaigns, there is evidence the labels have stuck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm leery of her. I can't put my finger on it,&quot; said Don McCord, a retired Air Force man who has voted for Democrats before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCord approached Porter at a recent candidates' day at the senior community where he lives. He wanted to hear Porter's thoughts about illegal immigration, a still-simmering issue in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCord did most of the talking. Porter nodded in agreement and listened closely for longer than most campaign handlers would consider efficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then promised to make strengthening security at the borders &quot;a top priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what I wanted to hear,&quot; McCord said later.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first, the woman with the ghost in her front yard and tombstones all over the lawn didn't recognize the Hollly&shy;wood star standing on her front porch, asking if Josh was home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Josh went to California this morning,&quot; 40-year-old Melissa McNichol said. Then she realized it was Patricia Arquette, star of the TV show &quot;Medium&quot; who has a long list of movie credits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh my gosh - I just got out of bed - I love 'Medium,' it's my favorite show,&quot; she gushed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arquette complimented her on the Halloween decorations that festooned the lawn in a middle-class neighborhood of Henderson, and asked McNichol if she planned to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she did, and the petite blonde Arquette, who is modest and polite to a fault, thanked her and moved on, along with a local canvasser, Juanita Turner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arquette wouldn't have been thrilled to hear who McNichol plans to vote for: Republican nominee John McCain. Arquette, an ardent supporter of Democrat Barack Obama, was looking for Democrats and independents , seeking to persuade them to get out to the polls on the first day of early voting Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why Josh, McNichol's 19-year-old son, was on the list Arquette and Turner were carrying on a handheld computer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voting kicked off in Nevada on Saturday, sounding the starting gun for political campaigns to start getting their voters to the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnout was heavy in Clark County. By early afternoon, 2004's record of 14,000 voters on the first day had been surpassed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as of about 7 p.m., more than 25,000 people had voted in Clark County, according to county Registrar of Voters Larry Lomax. That's about 3 percent of the county electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The early voting period lasts until Oct. 31. Election Day is Nov. 4. Officials expect at least half of Nevada voters to cast early ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group called America Votes brought Arquette and a busload of other mostly B-list actors from Los Angeles to walk from house to house in local neighborhoods with union organizers like Turner. They came here because their home state of California is not a swing state, but Nevada is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though she wasn't voting Arquette's way, McNichol was impressed. &quot;You don't expect somebody like that to come to your neighborhood and walk around,&quot; she said. &quot;It's fabulous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNichol said she doesn't particularly like either candidate, &quot;but I'm a Republican and I think I'm going to stay Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arquette had better luck finding who she was looking for at the next house, which had an &quot;I Love My Ferret&quot; sticker on the door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathi Stickler, a science teacher in her 50s, said she is still undecided but leaning toward Obama. &quot;I look at McCain and I just think, 'Four more years,'&quot; she said. &quot;That's what goes through my head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arquette talked about Obama's plans to improve education. &quot;You're going to have to make your own decision as a voter, but I just think this is the most crucial time,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stickler, holding Hannah, one of her five pet ferrets, said she planned to wait until Election Day but would definitely vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm so tired of the negativeness,&quot; she said of the campaign. &quot;I saw that Obama got on television and he didn't say anything about McCain, and I was so impressed. Don't tell me about the other person, I want to know what you're going to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, whose campaign has a big cash advantage over McCain's, has been airing both positive and negative commercials on Nevada television in recent weeks. Some are longer spots in which the Democrat speaks directly to the camera, touts his economic plans and does not mention his opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an Albertson's in Henderson where early voting was taking place, a line 10 deep snaked out the door. Kay Allison, 63, said she was there because she didn't want to procrastinate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not likely to get it done if I don't get it done early,&quot; she said. A registered Democrat, Allison said she was voting &quot;Palin-McCain&quot; because &quot;I think we're going to have problems if the other one gets in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priscilla Dea, 59, said she came out to vote on the first day because &quot;I'm so excited I can hardly stand it.&quot; She couldn't wait to vote for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dea has been to see Obama three times and on Friday night went to a rally in Henderson for his running mate, Sen. Joe Biden. An Air Force veteran, grandmother and unemployed hotel worker, Dea said the thousands of like-minded people at the rally were itching to cast their ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We couldn't wait until today,&quot; she said. &quot;We were so ready to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, George W. Bush crushed John Kerry in Stanislaus County, a Republican stronghold in California's Central Valley, by 18 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In neighboring San Joaquin Valley, not far from the San Francisco Bay area, the president's winning margin was 7 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in coastal Ventura County just north of Los Angeles, Bush notched a 2-point victory over Kerry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, however, Democrats hold a registration edge in those places that swung red not too long ago, with Democrats in Ventura even claiming their first advantage over the GOP in two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The turnover in voter registration margins reinforces a vexing trend for Republicans in the nation's most populous state. Once welcoming for its presidential candidates, the GOP has all but surrendered California today in those contests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan all notched wins in California, but the last Republican nominee to capture the state was George H.W. Bush two decades ago. This year, Arizona Sen. John McCain has virtually glossed over the state in his bid for the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;National Republican candidates have developed an unnecessary inferiority complex&quot; about California, said Kenneth Khachigian, a senior adviser in the Reagan White House who ran Bob Dole's 1996 campaign in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Democrats, California is &quot;ground they don't have to defend. McCain's army is all in the other states,&quot; Khachigian said. &quot;The economy and demographics of California have changed, no doubt about it, but it doesn't mean Republican shouldn't see opportunities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent polls have shown Illinois Sen. Barack Obama holding a double-digit edge over McCain in the state. Not surprisingly, the candidates have been scarce, spending virtually all their time in recent weeks in Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Florida and other battlegrounds where the contest will be decided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the outcome in California is all but certain, volunteers have been shipping out to other states where races are tighter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An internal memo shows McCain's California campaign is paying for buses to get volunteers to Nevada, a critical battleground. His California volunteers have been calling Nevada homes on behalf of the candidates, and the state Republican Party is also sending money to help McCain in Colorado and Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another sign of the lopsided California contest, Obama's campaign hasn't run a single TV ad aimed at state voters, typically the only way to reach them effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is limited money and you spend it where you have to have it,&quot; said Obama state director Mitchell Schwartz. In California &quot;we feel pretty strongly where we are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why has California which has the largest prize of electoral votes in the nation, 55 become a foregone conclusion in recent presidential races?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the reason Republicans are dubious about their chances is history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last significant push by a Republican presidential candidate to win California was in 2000, when George W. Bush spent more than $15 million, then lost to Democrat Al Gore by 12 points. Bush didn't contest the state in 2004, losing to Kerry by a double-digit margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats also control both U.S. Senate seats, the legislature and most statewide offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no single reason for the state's political makeover from the days of Nixon and Reagan, but the rapid growth in the number of Hispanic voters stands out a group that leans Democratic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independent Field Poll has found the share of Hispanic voters in the state roughly doubled between 1990 and 2005, from 10 percent to 19 percent, while the percentage share of the white vote dropped 12 points, down to 67 percent. The black vote remained about flat at 6 percent, and the Asian vote nudged up from 4 percent to 8 percent during that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a more dependable Democratic state than before,&quot; said Steve Frank, a longtime Republican activist. &quot;The demographics have changed dramatically over 20 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statewide, Democrats are heading toward the Nov. 4 election holding a 12-point registration edge over Republicans, 44 percent to 32 percent. That's up from an 8-point advantage for Democrats four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Latino voters are the main reason why California has transformed itself from what used to be a competitive state to a blue state,&quot; said Field pollster Mark DiCamillo, referring to the state's Democratic tilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In would be a tough year for a Republican nominee in California, regardless. Bush's approval rating is near all-time historic lows, and most Californians feel the nation is seriously off track. The housing crisis has fueled anxiety, deepened by Wall Street's troubles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The widening Democratic registration edge is partly due to aggressive enrollment efforts by Hillary Clinton and Obama during the primary season. But Democrats also have been sending campaign workers into fast-developing exurban areas like San Joaquin County far-flung residential areas beyond the traditional suburbs where Democrats fared poorly in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the growth of the Hispanic vote, Claremont McKenna College political scientist John Pitney said an important change in the state political complexion is vanishing defense jobs. Thirty years ago, California was an anchor in the defense industry, but many of those jobs have gone away, taking with them workers who tended to be more conservative, Pitney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another factor: independents. The fastest-growing political party in the state is no party at all. Part of Obama's lead in the polls is attributed to his appeal among independents, who in California lean left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shackled by a budget mess in Sacramento, Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has been mostly invisible in the presidential contest, though he might make a late trip to Ohio or another battleground state in a bid to help McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor, a moderate, has attributed the party's shrinking registration to its failure to take the lead on health care reform, global warming and other issues with broad public appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are dying at the box office,&quot; he said last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California also may be on the leading edge of a national shift. Some believe the nation is leaving a conservative era that dates to Reagan's White House years. Some polls suggest young adults the next generation of voters are more liberal-minded than their parents, particularly on social issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts say state Republicans have been hurt by focusing too much on social issues like abortion and gay rights, which turn off swing voters who often decide statewide races. Khachigian said the state's size and expensive media markets can be intimidating for presidential campaigns, but it's a mistake for McCain and the party to write it off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't remember the last time John was here,&quot; Khachigian said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LENGTH: Clinton and patriotism ads are 60 seconds, others are 30 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAID FOR BY: Our Country Deserves Better PAC, a Sacramento-based group formed to campaign against Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AIRING: PAC claims ads are airing in Nevada, Colorado and Michigan with a total ad buy of more than $100,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANALYSIS: The ads are the work of an independent group and are not produced by Republican candidate John McCain's campaign. The exact size of the ad buy is uncertain because it has not yet been reported to federal election officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's goal is to use provocative images to &quot;question the leadership, character and judgment of Barack Obama,&quot; according to PAC spokesman Joe Wierzbicki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wierzbicki said the group does not believe McCain's campaign has been strong enough in its attacks against Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The images and allegations are provocative and, in some cases, unfounded. Many have been circulating in e-mails and on blogs, but have not yet been raised by McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clips from a controversial sermon delivered by Obama's former pastor Jeremiah Wright are used in two ads to charge that Obama doesn't share average Americans' values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another ad questions Obama's patriotism with a video clip in which he does not hold his hand to his heart during the national anthem. A third accuses Obama of sympathizing with Islamic militants. The ad does not support the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PAC was formed in August by California political consultant Sal Russo and former California Assemblyman Howard Kaloogian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCRIPT EXCERPTS: &quot;Obama's Wrong Values&quot;: Announcer: &quot;Barack Obama seems to have different values than most Americans. ... Obama's campaign received $33,000 in illegal donations from Palestinians living the in the Middle East. A top official of the terrorist group Hamas endorsed Obama's campaign. And how can we forget these hateful sermons from Obama's pastor for over 20 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama Awful Tax Policies&quot;: Announcer: &quot;In 2007, Barack Obama was ranked by National Journal magazine as the most liberal member of the U.S. Senate. ... He says he'll raise social security taxes. And Obama even opposed a temporary repeal of the taxes you pay on gasoline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton Rips Barack Obama&quot;: Deborah Johns, conservative activist: &quot;We must oppose Obama. He's says he'll play nicey-nice with Islamic militants who want to kill Americans both here at home and abroad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's Patriotism Problem&quot;: Kaloogian: &quot;If America isn't good enough for Barack Obama then surely Barack Obama isn't good enough for America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KEY IMAGES: Clips of Wright declaring &quot;God damn America!&quot; in a sermon; Obama standing with his hands folded in front of him during what appears to the singing of the national anthem; Hillary Clinton declaring &quot;Shame on you, Barack Obama!&quot; at a news conference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sacramento County Republican Party removed images from its official Web site that compared Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama to Osama bin Laden and urged people to &quot;Waterboard Barack Obama,&quot; after state GOP leaders complained about the content. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sacramento Bee on Wednesday posted an image it said was captured from the Web site that showed Obama in a turban next to bin Laden. It said: &quot;The difference between Osama and Obama is just a little B.S.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Republican Party spokesman Hector Barajas said the party asked Sacramento GOP officials to remove the offensive material on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I indicated that this campaign is a campaign about the issues. Barack Obama is not a Muslim, he's a Christian, and that's been put forth by Sen. John McCain,&quot; Barajas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County Republican chairman Craig MacGlashan did not immediately respond to a telephone message left at his law office by The Associated Press on Wednesday. A home phone listing was no longer in service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Wednesday, the images of Obama juxtaposed with the terrorist who is believed to be the mastermind of the Sept. 11 terror attacks were replaced with cartoon images of the Illinois senator and an altered photo of Obama with the headline &quot;Progressive-Equally-Scary-Commie???&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ridiculous and baseless attacks like this won't work, and will actually remind voters that bin Laden is still out there because of the failed Bush-McCain policy that took our eye off of bin Laden to invade a country that had nothing to do with 9/11,&quot; said Brian Brokaw, a spokesman for the California Democratic party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barajas denied that McCain has fueled such comparisons to terrorists by accusing Obama of lying about his association with 1960s radical William Ayers, a founder of the violent anti-war group Weather Underground. Now a professor in Chicago, Ayers hosted a meet-the-candidate session at his home for Obama as he prepared to run for the Illinois Senate. Later, the two worked with the same charity and social-service organizations in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one's saying that Barack Obama wants to do harm to this country or is a terrorist, but since we have no legislation to go on for his record ... the question does become a question of judgment,&quot; Barajas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger denounced the offensive images originally posted on the county party Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This type of material, in the governor's view, is completely and totally inappropriate,&quot; spokeswoman Julie Soderlund said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacGlashan, the county party chairman, is married to Sacramento County Supervisor Roberta MacGlashan. He told The Bee in a story published Wednesday that he knew what was on the Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people find it offensive, others do not. I cannot comment on how people interpret things.&quot; He had told The Bee he would &quot;consider people's complaints&quot; before taking any action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The county party site also features a prominent banner ad and photo of Rep. Dan Lungren. A campaign official did not immediately respond to a telephone message from The AP on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats have been beating up on two vulnerable Republican state senators for weeks. The Republicans have done nothing to counter it. So others have stepped in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Bob Beers is getting a boost from a new political action committee headed by business lobbyist Mary Lau, while state Sen. Joe Heck is being defended by environmentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lau's group has sent out two mailers slamming Beers' opponent, Democrat Allison Copening, who has been widely criticized for not engaging in debates or having specific proposals to offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One flier decries the deluge of often misleading anti-Beers mail from the state Democratic Party as a mudslinging campaign, while the second mocks Copening's lack of proposals to deal with the state's budget shortfall. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't see any activity that was getting out the truth,&quot; Lau, the president of the Nevada Retail Association, said of the PAC, called the Committee to Improve Nevada's Economy and Education System. &quot;It gets frustrating to sit by and see innuendo becoming fact. What we're putting out is sourced, it's backed up, so the public can then make up their mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group plans to send mail to voters in Heck's district as well, Lau said. Heck is the other target of the Democrats' mail blitz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately, many in the GOP are grousing about the party's failure to hit back to defend the pair, on whose races the balance of power in the upper house of the Legislature hangs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Heck's constituents are receiving a mailer from the Nevada Conservation League that touts him as a friend of the environment, police and teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's policy director, Kyle Davis, said though the flier bears the logos of the police and teachers unions, it was paid for by the conservation league. It says, &quot;The People We Trust ... Trust Dr. Joe Heck,&quot; with images of a firefighter, a guy in a hard hat and a teacher in front of a blackboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis said it's the only mail the league has sent in this election cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We felt that it was a close race and he could probably use our help,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOMELESS IN D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a good reason why 2nd Congressional District Rep. Dean Heller, R-Nev., is looking as buff as Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When his wife, Lynne, and two school-age children moved back to Carson City so the kids could attend school here this fall, Heller moved out of their Virginia home and into his office in a congressional office building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With nothing better to do, Heller has been waking up at 4:30 each morning and heading down to the congressional gym for a 90-minute workout. He also takes daily two-mile runs around Washington, D.C. Fortunately, the gym has showers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It made no sense to spend $1,500 a month on an apartment,&quot; said Heller, estimating 60 to 70 other members of Congress also live out of their offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heller said it is convenient to live in his office, with a cot for his bed, since the House of Representatives sometimes holds votes at midnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Congress has gone on recess for three months, except for an expected brief lame-duck session after the election, Heller doesn't need his cot these days. He can sleep in his own bed back in Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE SIMPLE LIFE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the heck does U.S. Sen. John Ensign, a casino executive's son who lives in Las Vegas, know about rural life? Enough to be named to Republican presidential nominee John McCain's national rural leadership committee, apparently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing the leadership of the &quot;McCain-Palin Farm &amp; Ranch Team&quot; last week, the campaign said it was affirming the Republican's &quot;vision for agriculture and rural prosperity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This distinguished team of elected officials and leaders in agriculture share a common goal with John McCain: to provide the leadership necessary to create prosperity in America's rural heartland,&quot; the campaign news release said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensign, the only Nevadan named to the committee, surely knows his way around a golf course better than a 40-acre plot. The McCain campaign didn't respond to a query about Ensign's inclusion as a steering committee member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Ensign spokesman said although the senator, who grew up in Northern Nevada, never lived in a rural setting, he represents a largely rural state and has learned about rural issues in his frequent tours of rural Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He understands issues like water, federal lands, ranching issues and the importance of Second Amendment rights,&quot; Tory Mazzola said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensign hears frequently about gun rights from his rural constituents, and the contrast between McCain and Democrat Barack Obama on the issue is stark, Mazzola said. The National Rifle Association endorsed McCain last week, with its president making a stop in Reno to announce the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the senator, a veterinarian who often includes pets in his political commercials, is a hunter, Mazzola said Ensign &quot;has been hunting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's been on pheasant hunting trips to South Dakota,&quot; Mazzola said. &quot;He also enjoys fishing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS DEMOCRATAS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new poll of Nevada Hispanics shows Democrat Barack Obama winning their votes by a wide margin, but many in that demographic group still had not made up their minds in the survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll found 55 percent of Hispanic registered voters strongly supported Obama, while just 14 percent strongly supported McCain. Nearly a third either indicated weak support for a candidate or were undecided (12 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When weak supporters were included, it was 67 percent for Obama, 20 percent for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll of 400 Nevada Hispanic voters was conducted in August and September by the bilingual research firm Latino Decisions for the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund. It carries a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most impressive number in the poll was the percentage of Nevada Hispanic registered voters who said they almost definitely plan to vote this year: 90 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In past elections, Hispanics' clout has been hampered by low turnout compared to other groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UP ON THE AIR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is airing a new television ad custom-made for Nevada and has ramped up his spending in the state as the campaign enters its final weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, McCain's campaign has been outspending Obama on airtime, but a new report from the Wisconsin Advertising Project shows the trend has reversed and Obama is spending twice as much as McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the week of Sept. 28 to Oct. 4, Obama spent $616,000 to McCain's $329,000 on Nevada television, according to the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Las Vegas television market was the No. 1 market in the country for Obama campaign ads and the No. 2, after Denver, for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Obama&nbsp;ad that debuted Thursday focuses on McCain's proposal to end the tax exemption on employer-funded health benefits, a cost McCain says would be offset with a new tax credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Nevada we work hard, and many of us get health insurance through our jobs,&quot; the ad says. &quot;John McCain's health plan would tax our health benefits as income. ... John McCain doesn't get Nevada. He doesn't get us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, McCain's campaign continues to try to use accusations of voter registration fraud in Nevada on the part of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now to attack Obama, who has ties to the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee released a Web-only ad about the issue. Tying ACORN to risky mortgages as well as the voter registration investigation, it says of Obama, &quot;Bad judgment. Blind ambition. Too risky for America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC also started a Web site, ObamaAcornTree.com.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A campaign finance &quot;watchdog&quot; outfit last week filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission against two groups - one pro-Republican and the other pro-Democrat - alleging they violated the law by airing political ads during the current presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democracy 21 wants the FEC to investigate the American Issues Project, which ran a $2.8 million general-election ad campaign against Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama, and the American Leadership Project, a group that backed Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries and ran about $4.3 million in ads supporting her against Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint argues that both groups violated the law by not submitting for registration as political action committees, which would have restricted their fund-raising to capped donations. The American Leadership Project was largely financed by unions that supported Clinton. The American Issues Project ad against Obama was funded by Texas billionaire Harold Simmons, a McCain fundraiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Issues Project is a nonprofit 501(c)4 organization. It ran August ads in Michigan and Ohio linking Obama to William Ayers, a Vietnam-era militant who helped found the violent Weather Underground, who is unrepentant about bombing the Pentagon in those days, and who helped Barack Obama launch his presidential campaign. Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, also wrote to the Internal Revenue Service, asking the IRS to examine whether the group violated its nonprofit status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax laws - and to a lesser extent the FEC regulations - holding who can operate as a &quot;non-profit&quot; group and what level of political activity they can fund under that rubric are complex. Any ruling is likely to hinge on the complexities of the tax code - which means any ruling is likely to end up in court, after this election is a fading memory, since the FEC commissioners are not noted for their expertise in tax law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just once, though, wouldn't it be refreshing to see someone in a position of authority in this country cut through such piles of pleadings with the directness of Alexander at Gordium?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supposedly in response to an oracle predicting the man who untied the intricate Gordian knot would conquer all Asia, the Macedonian commander simply sliced the thing in half with his sword.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A parallel ruling on the question at issue would simply hold: &quot;1) If the law does not restrict such advertising, the case is dismissed. On the other hand, 2) If the law does restrict such advertising (that being the only other possible finding), then since freedom of speech is enshrined in the Bill of Rights, and since fact-based political speech criticizing a politician or candidate during an election year is arguably the form of free speech most vital to the safety of the republic, the law in question is obviously unconstitutional and therefore both this case and the law itself are hereby thrown out and declared null and void.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some will hold neither the FEC commissioners nor any court lower than the Supreme Court could rule on the constitutionality of these sections of the IRS code. But that's clearly wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every federal official swears an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. If they're unable to determine what that means, they're honor bound to refuse to swear the oath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oath does not compel them to protect and defend the Constitution &quot;but only after I wait for the Supreme Court to get around to telling me how.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a misguided Legislature enacted a law requiring that members of some specific race or faith be shot on sight, there is not a judge or commissioner in the country (we firmly hope) who would say, &quot;Oh well, it's the law, so let's get to it. I surely hope this matter reaches the Supreme Court before they're all dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. They would declare such an edict unconstitutional on sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they should do, here.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REVIEW-JOURNAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if being bombarded by presidential candidate and political party ads weren't enough, independent groups also are starting to flood the airwaves in Nevada as the election nears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wake Up Wal-Mart campaign, a project of the United Food and Commercial Workers union, is targeting Nevada and eight other states with a television ad about alleged pay discrimination against women at the big-box retailer, which it ties to Republican John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They put in the same long hours as men, but take home less,&quot; the ad says. &quot;Mothers, daughters, breadwinners. ... But when fair pay legislation came to the Senate, John McCain helped defeat it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberal group MoveOn.org also has been airing anti-McCain ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a less partisan note, the New Policy Institute, an affiliate of the liberal group NDN, is airing Spanish-language radio ads in the Las Vegas market urging Hispanics to vote for the sake of their illustrious forebears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Invoking Roberto Clemente, Selena and Cesar Chavez, the ad says, &quot;Yes, we have come really far, but we can't live from glories of the past. This year, it is up to you to decide if we stay where we are or if we continue to move forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both presidential candidates have in the past spoken out against outside groups putting up big money to influence elections, but both have gone mysteriously mum on the subject as the election nears. Still, observers say at least so far, the amount of independent expenditure advertising in the presidential race is nowhere near the deluge seen in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HENDERSON HIJINKS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race for Henderson mayor is turning into a free-for-all, with two of the five members of the City Council and one former member readying runs in next year's municipal election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Councilwoman Amanda Cyphers last week announced her candidacy for the position, which is being vacated by popular Mayor Jim Gibson because of term limits. Cyphers served on the council from 1995 to 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A news release kicking off her run touted Cyphers' dedication to the job, noting that she &quot;sold her successful medical auditing business in 1995 to be a full-time councilwoman. She has once again closed out her business interests to devote her entire attention to the mayoral race. If successfully elected, she will be a full-time mayor for our city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also still planning to run, they said recently, are Councilmen Steve Kirk and Andy Hafen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm in with both feet. Definitely I'm going to run,&quot; Kirk said last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hafen, interviewed at a community event last month, also said he still had his sights on the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men said they plan to make an official announcement in the next couple of months, after all the hubbub from the general election has died down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for why so many of his current and former colleagues on the council feel as he does, Kirk said this level of interest is to be expected &quot;anytime you have an open seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Jim Gibson could run again, I don't think any of us would be interested in running,&quot; said Kirk, who described the outgoing mayor as a prime example of term limits forcing a good public servant out the door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other members of the council are newcomer Gerri Schroder and Jack Clark. Clark has been the subject of rumors he, too, might make a run, but Kirk said Clark plans to support his bid. Clark didn't return a phone call last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Council races are technically nonpartisan, but if you must know, Kirk and Cyphers are Republicans, while Hafen and Gibson are Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, when Hafen was asked who he's planning to vote for in the race between Republican Jon Porter and Democrat Dina Titus for the 3rd Congressional District, he demurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, Hafen's daughter Tessa took on Porter in what turned out to be a nasty fight. You'd think Andy Hafen couldn't wait to see Porter gone this time around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Hafen has also known Porter, a former Boulder City mayor and councilman, for more than two decades. And so, he said, he's not telling. &quot;I'll go into the booth and make my choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MASTER OF TIMING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Jim Gibbons angered some of the people he can least afford to alienate with the announcement last week that he's holding a fundraiser at Lake Tahoe this Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources say some of his top political advisers counseled against holding the event, which features a host committee of wealthy Northern Nevadans and a $250-a-head price of admission. In a time of economic crunch, with businesses squeezed, political donations are hard to come by, and the Republicans who need the money the most are the ones whose elections are next month, not Gibbons, whose re-election effort is in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, Republican insiders said, vulnerable state Senate Republicans Bob Beers and Joe Heck need to keep their seats if Gibbons is to have any hope of getting support in next year's' legislative session. If either of them loses, Democrats will control both the Assembly and state Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Competing with your own candidates in a tough cycle with limited funds?&quot; one source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. &quot;It's easier to sell Chinese milk than the Republican brand this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not known how much campaign cash Gibbons has on hand. He doesn't have to report it until January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLL: Obama pulls ahead </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest Rasmussen Reports survey of Nevada voters puts Democrat Barack Obama out front of Republican John McCain, 51 percent to 47 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's consistent with another independent poll released last week, an Opinion Research Corp. survey that also had Obama up 51-47. In addition, an InsiderAdvantage poll put Obama at 48 percent, McCain at 47 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The polls appear to be trending in Obama's direction after several months in which McCain generally enjoyed a small but consistent lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rasmussen poll of 700 likely voters carries a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Previously, Rasmussen polls, which are conducted by automated phone call, had not put Obama in the lead here since July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama leads by nine points among Nevada women, the pollster noted, but trails by two points among men.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Clinton knows better than anyone how a Democrat gets elected president. Like the eager-beaver smartest kid in class, he loves to tell you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1988 the late Lloyd Bentsen, then the Democratic nominee for vice president, came through Arkansas to campaign. Clinton bounded all around Bentsen, literally waving a sheet of paper. On it he had scripted an ad that he believed Michael Dukakis needed to run to confront and counter the Willie Horton controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typically, Dukakis was trying to ignore it all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's text amounted to a counter-punch, something that acknowledged and absorbed the Horton jab without trying to deny that it's bad, really bad, when a guy gets out of prison on a weekend furlough and kills somebody. But then it tried to say that the presidential race wasn't about one killer or one tragic correctional snafu, but a host of economic issues affecting millions of law-abiding, hard-working people and on which Dukakis presumably had better ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years later, Clinton would show everyone what he was talking about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, in this year's context, we must first devote a few words to the petulance and bitterness that has caused Clinton to appear tepid - indeed, be tepid - toward Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's because Clinton, a temperamental guy, is mad - at himself, for getting tactics and rhetoric wrong in service to his wife's campaign against Obama, and at the Obama campaign for turning one of his nobler things, a solid record of racial sensitivity and progress, against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hard feelings reveal themselves when Clinton spouts the Obama party line as if by mere rote, without enthusiasm. He tepidness is palpable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otherwise, though, Clinton has given the Democrats a pretty good blueprint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While his glowing words about John McCain and his friendly ones about Sarah Palin have exasperated Democrats, he knows what he's doing. He understands that Democrats attack a war hero like McCain at great risk. He knows, as one trained in the common-man connections of Arkansas, that Democrats ridicule Palin also at great risk, because it is the woman's very commonness that people find compelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So on Wednesday Clinton made his first campaign appearance for Obama. It was in Florida. Nothing energizes Clinton like a large and adoring crowd, which he gleefully confronted. That's unless it would be poll numbers. And there were fresh ones that day, showing Obama inching ahead in Florida and Ohio and nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton grasped the plain and simple factors: Economic events were accruing dramatically to Democrats' benefit and Palin's horrid performance in an interview with Katie Couric had fomented fear about the Republican ticket, aging at the top and uninformed at the bottom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his remarks at that Florida rally, Clinton repeated his observation about why people show a personal affinity for Palin. He reiterated that Democrats needed to be personally respectful. But then he proposed a way to exploit those two poll factors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Democrats must stress that Obama has a better feel for, and better plan for, the economy than does McCain. Then, he said, Democrats need to extol their vice presidential nominee, Joe Biden, for his clear foreign policy bona fides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a message that's positive in both respects. And it's a message that says not a bad word personally about McCain or Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats might do well to cut Clinton a little slack on his petulance and tepidness while taking heed on the strategy and tactics he offers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's unless they know of some other Democrat who knows more about getting elected president in the modern time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 3rd Congressional District rings Las Vegas in a geographic embrace, then sprawls outward to the edges of Clark County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some rough neighborhoods on the east side of town and some tony parts of far-western Summerlin. There's McCarran International Airport and all of Henderson. It extends from Boulder City out to Searchlight and Laughlin, west to Indian Springs and east to parts of Mesquite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a battleground district in a battleground state, the site of one of the most competitive races in the nation for a seat in the House of Representatives this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Middle-class, increasingly diverse, suburban and outlying exurban rather than purely rural or inner-city, it's populations such as this across the country that both parties hope to sway in the 2008 election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a microcosm of the American swing vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 3rd District is a great example of the suburban and exurban areas Democrats have been targeting and making gains in over the last couple of years,&quot; said Nathan Gonzales, an analyst for the Rothenberg Political Report, a national nonpartisan newsletter. His publication recently shifted its assessment of the race from up in the air to tilting toward the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vying to represent the district in Washington are two political veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incumbent Jon Porter, a Republican, has had the office since the district was created in 2002, the result of Nevada's population growth. He's being challenged by Dina Titus, the longtime leader of the state Senate's Democratic minority, who is well known statewide from her 2006 run for governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Legislature, charged with drawing the boundaries, created the 3rd District as a perfect swing district, with about the same number of Republicans and Democrats and a large tranche of nonpartisan voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was created with Porter in mind - at the time, he was a state senator who had already run unsuccessfully for Congress once before - but it was also created to ensure he would always have to fight to hold onto it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ground has shifted. A district that just two years ago was evenly split between Democrats and Republicans now contains 43 percent Democrats and 36 percent Republicans, according to the Clark County Election Department. There are more than 31,000 more Democrats than Republicans registered in the district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The challenge Porter has always had representing a district with a booming population is having to reintroduce himself to voters every election,&quot; Gonzales said. &quot;Some of those voters probably aren't happy with President Bush and probably don't know much about Jon Porter. He can't rely on his record for the district, because a lot of them don't know it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, Porter's opponents have mostly been political newcomers: a young county commissioner (who later wound up in federal prison on corruption charges), a millionaire casino executive and a 30-year-old former staffer to U.S. Sen. Harry Reid. Even allies of those challengers would acknowledge they had thin r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and no experience in a political fight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats in Washington were determined to find a candidate who could beat him this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the party's handpicked candidate made his debut: Robert Daskas, a Clark County prosecutor well respected for his work in the courtroom on big murder trials but totally unknown in political circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seemed Democrats were repeating their strategy from years past: pluck a newcomer from relative obscurity, with no record to attack, and make the race about Jon Porter. Then, in April, suddenly Daskas dropped out, citing personal reasons. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's when Titus, who previously had turned down appeals to run for the seat, agreed to be the candidate to take on Porter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus: An Energized, Coordinated Campaign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 people were gathered in a gazebo in a park near Buffalo Drive and Craig Road as Titus began her day of campaigning on a recent Saturday morning. There were union members in their local's T-shirts, moms with kids, college students in black &quot;got titus?&quot; shirts left over from her 2006 gubernatorial campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was similar to the loyal core of supporters who showed up when she announced her campaign in May to a capacity crowd. Indeed, if Titus had one thing that Daskas lacked, it was this: a base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus, 58, grew up in a small town in Georgia and retains a strong Southern accent, a quality she plays for laughs in a recent campaign ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, she has served in the state Senate for 20 years. She has been married to fellow UNLV professor Tom Wright for 29 years; they have no children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the volunteers in the park, 61-year-old Linda Manninen, said she wasn't sure for whom she would vote for president; she had qualms about Democrat Barack Obama and liked Republican John McCain's choice of running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. But she was there for Titus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dina has a lot of good values,&quot; Manninen said. &quot;She's done so much for this community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on display that day at the park was the other major factor Titus has going for her: Democrats' unprecedented organization and enthusiasm in Nevada this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have never seen Democrats so coordinated,&quot; Titus said as she made her way to the park from across the street, where she had parked the Lincoln MKX she drives in a subdivision of big homes on small lots with streets named Perfect Day Avenue and Cunning Fellow Court. &quot;People are just excited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd gathered in the gazebo to get marching orders from Evan Sutton, a field director for the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They would be knocking on doors of houses that database scientists had determined might house potential voters. Be persistent, Sutton told them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only people who are definitely not voting are the ones who say, 'I'm moving out of the state of Nevada and I'm not keeping a residence here,'&quot; Sutton said. &quot;Anybody else, there's still a chance. Maybe they'll watch a debate. Maybe they'll get a foreclosure notice and realize it does affect them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The canvassers would be armed with Obama and Titus literature, pamphlets for state Senate candidates and Assembly candidates and even Democratic judges. &quot;You're going to go down the list to the next candidate and the next candidate and the next candidate,&quot; Sutton said. &quot;This is how we're going to win the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus got up to speak next. &quot;This is the face of the Democratic Party,&quot; she said. &quot;It's not like the Republican Party. You see a picture of them, it doesn't look like us. I think we look a whole lot better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The canvassers, she said, &quot;are helping me, you are helping Obama, you are helping our Senate candidates and our Assembly candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They lined up at a long table to pick up their clipboards and maps and bundles of fliers. Among them were a group of 30 Asian-Americans from Southern California who came out for the weekend hoping to make a difference in a swing state, which Nevada is and California is not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oiyan Poon, 32, a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles, said it was Obama that inspired her to be more politically active than she's been before, but helping Titus is also part of the goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just really think the country's been going in the wrong direction,&quot; she said. &quot;It's time for a change. We're participating in democracy. We're taking back our government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, Titus says, is the difference between her run this year and her gubernatorial campaign two years ago: She has both the grass-roots supporters who have always loved her and the Democratic establishment, which has helped her raise money at an impressive clip despite her late entry in the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It feels good,&quot; she said in an interview en route to a house party in southwest Las Vegas, where she'll pick up checks and mingle with old friends. &quot;I know we've got the resources to get the job done, so there's not a lot of drama in the campaign. It's just a matter of doing what we need to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porter: Familiar Ground, Familiar Faces</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a recent weekend, Porter could be found at a country-club fundraiser - not for himself, but for a community group working to build a Henderson hospice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The congressman, dressed in a short-sleeved shirt and khakis, circulated unassumingly in the yard behind the Sun City Anthem clubhouse as a barbershop quartet calling themselves the Sun City Sound kicked things off with a tune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hi, neighbor,&quot; the four older guys in matching polo shirts harmonized, &quot;Now's the time to say hi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man recognized Porter and approached to shake his hand. &quot;I just want to thank you,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six years ago, Tim Ryan's wife was dying of cancer. As her condition declined, he wrestled with whether to put her in hospice care. Finally he made the decision - &quot;It was gut-wrenching,&quot; he said - and then there were no hospice beds available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a wait, she was finally admitted to the Nathan Adelson Hospice, and a few days later she died. Ryan decided then that he would spearhead an effort to get a hospice facility in his hometown. &quot;I wanted just one good thing to come of it,&quot; he said of his ordeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ryan, 58, has spent the last few years holding meetings at his house and other people's houses and the local library; meeting with City Council members and the mayor and members of the County Commission; and appealing to Nevada's congressional delegation for support. On a trip to Washington, D.C., Porter met with him personally without an appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not a very political person,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;He helped me. He helped this project. He took a lot of time to listen to the problem.&quot; That's not about being a Republican or a Democrat, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the image Porter is trying to cultivate this election cycle: a servant of the community rather than a partisan. The Republican label is a toxic one nationally this year. Candidates from McCain on down are trying to distance themselves from President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In ads and interviews, Porter, 53, almost never mentions that he's a congressman. He emphasizes his tenure on the Boulder City Council and as mayor of that city, positions he held in the 1980s; he touts himself as a small-business owner based on the insurance agency he directed throughout that time and his time in the state Senate. Porter is twice divorced and has two adult children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His experience on the City Council, he said in an interview, taught him to be more &quot;solution-driven.&quot; He doesn't mind that he always has to fight for his political life: &quot;Every member of Congress ought to be in an evenly split district,&quot; he said. &quot;There'd be less partisan bickering, more finding common ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porter's campaign commercials are painting Titus as a tax-hiker just as Gibbons did in 2006. Unlike previous races, Porter this time has an opponent with baggage from 20 years in public office, a record of legislative votes and an outspokenness that sometimes offends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of Titus' attacks on Porter has been the same as that of the campaign that nearly ousted him two years ago: that he is a clone of Bush, voting with the president 90 percent of the time. But in the last two years Porter has increasingly broken with his party - for example, voting in favor of extending the State Children's Health Insurance Program - a move that opponents see as tacking to the center for political reasons. Porter says it has to do with the specifics of the bills being voted on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If 'moderate' means you look at all sides of a problem and try to come up with a solution, then I guess that makes me a moderate,&quot; Porter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the singers finished, Porter took the stage at the country club fundraiser to polite applause. He thanked the other officials present and said, &quot;I don't know of a person that is here today that hasn't experienced the pain and suffering of a loved one, in their final hours, in need of the touch of an angel. I really believe that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another constituent made a beeline for Porter. Richard Fulton had something to say to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I voted for you last time, I'm going to vote for you again, but I didn't like your vote on that energy bill,&quot; the 78-year-old said. &quot;That was a bad bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porter nodded understandingly. &quot;Well, this does something, even if it's just a little,&quot; he said of the bill that lifted some restrictions on offshore oil drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fulton, a retired oil worker, was still fuming as Porter moved on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill, he said, didn't allow drilling in the places where the oil really is. &quot;It's cosmetic,&quot; he said. &quot;It's absolutely a subterfuge the Democrats did to look like they're doing something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Fulton has no intention of casting a protest vote against Porter for his heresy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's better than the opposition,&quot; Fulton explained. &quot;I know Dina Titus. She's a flaming liberal that will spend all my money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Porter, &quot;I think he's a pretty good man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imperfect, obviously, but a good man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PORTER AND TITUS ON THE ISSUES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECONOMY AND JOBS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porter: Believes lowering fuel costs by expanding energy sources is the key to reviving tourism and diversifying Nevada's economy, along with keeping taxes on business low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus: Jobs plan focuses on expanding incentives for the renewable energy industry to bring those jobs to Nevada, along with research and development grants for local universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WALL STREET BAILOUT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porter: Voted for the unpopular original plan that failed to pass the House on Monday, saying he believes strongly that something must be done to restore confidence in banks and the financial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus: Opposed the bailout plan, saying it didn't include sufficient provisions to prevent future financial crisis or relief for families facing home foreclosures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENERGY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porter: Favors an &quot;all of the above&quot; approach to ending dependence on foreign oil, including allowing offshore drilling, expanding renewable energy and policies that encourage conservation. Believes tax incentives for domestic energy production, including oil companies, should be kept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus: Supports offshore drilling as long as states allow it off their coasts and royalties go to renewable energy. Would take away tax breaks for big oil companies and give tax breaks to renewable energy development instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IRAQ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porter: Opposes timelines for ending the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus: Favors setting timetables to bring troops home safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAXES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porter: Would extend the Bush tax cuts, making them permanent. Believes low taxes for all income levels are good for the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus: Would allow Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans to expire. Favors tax relief for middle-class families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMMIGRATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porter: Believes the border must be secured before any other action is taken. Has not taken a clear position on what should be done about the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants already living in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus: Supports comprehensive immigration reform, including securing the border; no amnesty for illegal immigrants but a pathway to citizenship, including penalties, for deserving illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new independent statewide poll finds Democrat Barack Obama leading Republican John McCain in Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among likely Nevada voters, 51 percent would vote for Obama and 47 percent for McCain if the election were held today, according to the poll, conducted by Opinion Research Corp. for CNN and Time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among all registered voters, Obama's advantage was even larger: He led McCain by 54 percent to 43 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll, conducted Sunday through Tuesday, carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for registered voters, 4 points for likely voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada was one of five battleground states surveyed by the national news organizations; Obama also led in the other four states, Florida, Minnesota, Missouri and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A previous Nevada poll by the same group a month ago also gave the edge to Obama. The Aug. 24-26 poll of registered voters had Obama up 49 percent to 44 percent for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other polls have found mixed results in this battleground state but have tended to favor McCain slightly. According to Pollster.com, a Web site that tracks and aggregates political poll results, McCain is averaging 48.1 percent in Nevada polling while Obama's average is 46.3 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National polling has registered an uptick in support for Obama in the last week as the economy has foundered in chaos and the two candidates have faced off in their first debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada appears to be following that trend, said national political expert Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The national polls have moved in Obama's direction since the beginning of the financial crisis,&quot; he said. &quot;Americans are frightened and upset, so they naturally move to the party out of power in the White House. The state polls are following the national polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, he noted that while professional commentators generally scored the presidential debate a tie, surveys of voters found them more impressed by Obama's performance in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The debate helped Obama,&quot; Sabato said. &quot;Every survey has shown it, despite what the pundits said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both parties are mounting aggressive campaigns in Nevada, which has voted for the winner of every presidential election except one since 1912. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group that claims 30,000 veterans as members has begun running a television ad in California criticizing Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's record on Iraq and Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has enjoyed a comfortable lead among likely voters in the nation's most delegate-rich state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second spot by Vets for Freedom began running Wednesday in media markets outside the San Francisco Bay area. The group says it is spending $2.2 million on the ad campaign, which is scheduled to run through Oct. 9. It declined to say where it gets its money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pete Hegseth, the group's chairman, said the funding comes from &quot;folks who write us checks who believe in what we're doing. ... We have an obligation to our donors to protect their interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also has television commercials airing in other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The California ad says Obama missed 45 percent of Senate votes, voted against emergency funding for troops in Iraq and failed to hold oversight hearings on the situation in Afghanistan while making 45 campaign trips to Iowa and only two trips to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It urges him to support a resolution by Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, an ally of Republican presidential candidate John McCain, acknowledging the success of the surge President Bush's decision in January 2007 to send more than 20,000 additional troops to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabriel Sanchez, a spokesman for Obama said the ad is &quot;extremely misleading.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Obama voted against one war funding bill because it lacked language calling for a withdrawal from Iraq but had supported several others. Obama's subcommittee did not hold a hearing on Afghanistan because that subject was the territory of the full Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, a longtime critic of President Bush's decision to invade Iraq, addressed those questions during last Friday's televised debate with McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama has been a champion for our wounded warriors,&quot; Sanchez said. &quot;This is just out-and-out distortions. It's a disservice to the people of California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama wants to focus U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan because that region is where al-Qaida is based, Sanchez added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, joined Hegseth at a Los Angeles news conference to announce the ad. A Marine Corps veteran, Wilson criticized Obama for proposing to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq within 16 months after taking office. Wilson said that would &quot;totally undermine what has been achieved by the surge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a telephone interview, he said the U.S. should keep troops in Iraq &quot;until we achieve victory, until Iraq is capable of maintaining their own public safety and achieve political milestones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former governor said he agreed to participate in the news conference because he believes passionately in the campaign by the Vets for Freedom. He said the group was running the ads to promote the perception that the surge is working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Public Policy Institute of California poll released last week showed Obama with a 10-point lead over McCain in California.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a little vignette about the cynicism of modern American politics. Necessarily, it's mostly about John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We face a real crisis in our high-finance industry. It's the fault of private greed, private arrogance and government negligence in curbing private greed and arrogance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Absent a government bailout, repercussions could be severe on working Americans bearing no responsibility. Small business loans and home mortgage loans - indeed, consumer credit - could become expensive, tight or nonexistent. Americans' precious savings for retirement could plummet. We could have a deep recession. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lame-duck president with no remaining credibility, acting through his treasury secretary and in concert with the Fed, proposes a solution. It's to pledge up to $700 billion in taxpayer money to bail Wall Street out of losses, not so much to save Wall Street as to avoid the dire repercussions for the nation's economic health and regular people's well-being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats in Congress are inclined to support it, but they worry that John McCain and his Republicans might label them big-government spenders and friends of the rich and powerful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not an altogether paranoid worry. McCain's campaign has been uncommonly brazen in its cynicism, claiming a mantle of change because of the running mate selection of an unqualified Alaskan neophyte, then decrying insider influence while McCain's own campaign manager has a lobbying firm that, until a month ago, was on retainer from Freddie Mac, one of the bailed-out mortgage guarantors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans in Congress are divided, with the more fervently right-wing of them genuinely uncomfortable with the idea of government money getting commingled quite this much with the private sector. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, Democratic candidate for president, gets an idea. He telephones McCain and suggests that, owing to the dire delicacy of the situation and a need for their joint leadership, they issue an agreed-to statement endorsing the concept of a bailout and detailing whatever shared concepts or particulars they could manage to forge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This puts McCain in a political spot. There's a new poll out showing that the financial crisis is hurting him in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So McCain says to Obama that, yeah, maybe they could do such a statement. But he knows that, if he simply goes along, word will get out that this was Obama's initiative and leadership, not his, thus enhancing Obama's prestige and exacerbating McCain's vulnerability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain needs to seize some kind of initiative of his own. He throws his second desperation pass of the month, the first having been his aforementioned choice of this unqualified Alaskan neophyte as his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of the day, McCain blind-sides and trumps Obama by announcing that, owing to this financial crisis and the need for leadership, he is suspending his campaign and going to Washington to work on a compromise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also proposes that he and Obama postpone their scheduled debate Friday night from the University of Mississippi. He says they need to rise above politics for the moment, though, of course, what he is doing is wholly political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign then puts out a memo that leaks to reporters and gives local supporters &quot;talking points&quot; about how to spin political advantage from McCain's supposed rise above politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wasn't Obama's original call also wholly political? Yes. He was trying to secure cover for himself and congressional Democrats. He was trying to appear presidential. But at least he was trying to get this done in reasonable person-to-person discussions with his rival, not with a brazen publicity stunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suffice to say that John McCain isn't in New Hampshire on his Straight Talk Express anymore.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pro-immigration group has launched a new televison ad campaign intended to revive discussion of immigration reform in some swing states key to the presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexicans and Americans Thinking Together, a nonprofit that describes itself as nonpartisan, launched the campaign Thursday with a 60-second spot urging for a call to finish the work of immigration reform. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad claims that border security has improved and deportation of illegal immigrants has increased since the heated 2006 reform debate in Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's finish the job by enacting comprehensive immigration solutions. We need to bring the estimated 12 million undocumented workers who are in our country into a legal system of employment,&quot; the ad says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spot is running in Las Vegas, Denver, Albuquerque and Phoenix. The group says it has plans to go up next in Richmond, Va.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Texas Rep. Henry Bonilla, a spokesman for the San Antonio-based group, says the aim is to encourage a &quot;middle-of-the-road solution&quot; that addresses both security issues and the needs of employers and immigrants seeking work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad does not advocate directly for a &quot;path to citizenship&quot; for those who entered the country illegally. The provision was among those that sank the 2006 immigration reform bill co-sponsored by Sen. John McCain, now the Republican presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonilla said the group tried to stay away from phrases that &quot;stir people up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're by no means saying one aspect has to be involved. We're saying everyone has to keep this fire burning, so that there is a solution at the end,&quot; Bonilla said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the issue hit a boiling point two years ago, immigration reform has slipped on voters' lists of top concerns. Amid the financial turmoil on Wall Street, it's unlikely either candidate will take up the issue in the final weeks of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both McCain and Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama say they want to reform the troubled immigration system. McCain has said he would not reintroduce the bill he once supported in the Senate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush and his party's presidential nominee, John McCain, will both be in Nevada next week, but you won't see them together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush is scheduled to be in Las Vegas on Oct. 2 for a meeting of the Republican Governors Association, according to an invitation to the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, campaign sources say McCain will be in Reno that day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unpopular president is considered political kryptonite for McCain and other Republican politicians, so it's perhaps not surprising that their paths aren't expected to cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Jim Gibbons is among the governors scheduled to attend the Republican gathering at The Venetian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also attending, according to the invitation, are the governors of Texas, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and Utah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the afternoon fundraiser reception with the president, for which ticket packages start at $5,000, the governors are scheduled to hold a vice presidential debate watch party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of McCain's visit haven't been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPECIALLY INTERESTED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the time-honored tradition of political ads attacking candidates' perceived strengths rather than weaknesses, a new television ad paints state Sen. Dina Titus as weak on education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus, the Democratic challenger to Rep. Jon Porter, R-Nev., in the 3rd Congressional District, is an educator herself and generally considered an advocate for education in Carson City. Porter's new ad charges that she &quot;voted against reforms to improve our schools.&quot; Among other things, it says she &quot;voted against giving local schools control of class sizes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dina Titus: Whose side is she on?&quot; the ad intones in closing. &quot;Not ours. The special interests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titus' campaign fired back by wondering what special interests the ad is referring to and charging that it is Porter who has taken campaign contributions from industry and then done corporations' bidding. The 2003 and 2005 votes on class sizes, Titus' campaign said, would have allowed local districts to increase them beyond the student-teacher ratios mandated in class-size reduction legislation, and that's why she opposed the bills in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As an educator for 30 years, Dina Titus is committed to Nevada's students and teachers, unlike Jon Porter who supported the largest cut to student aid in history and underfunded No Child Left Behind,&quot; Titus spokesman Andrew Stoddard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON THE AIR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain continues to outspend Democrat Barack Obama when it comes to Nevada television advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a national analysis of post-convention ad spending by the Wisconsin Advertising Project, McCain's campaign spent $365,000 on Nevada commercials during the week of Sept. 6-13, while Obama's spent $297,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada was one of 17 states where Obama was on the air, while McCain was buying airtime in 15 states, the study found. The two candidates spent $15 million on advertising that week alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While independent groups haven't been as active in this election as they were four years ago, there are signs they are starting to step up their involvement. The liberal issues group MoveOn.org last week started targeting McCain in Nevada and other states with an ad that hits his ties to lobbyists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad shows a succession of clips of McCain using his trademark salutation, &quot;My friends,&quot; then asks, &quot;When John McCain says, 'My friends,' do you know who he's talking about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It then shows some of the top lobbyists who have been McCain advisers and contributors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group is spending $200,000 to air the ad on Nevada networks. It's also airing on national cable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race in Nevada continues to be a tight one, according to polling. A Sept. 12-14 statewide poll by American Research Group put McCain up, 49 percent to 46 percent. The poll of 600 likely Nevada voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOT SO GLOOMY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John Ensign has dropped the Eeyore bit when it comes to talking about Republican prospects in U.S. Senate races this fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The once-downcast chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee says he is newly optimistic, to the point where he mused to reporters last week that it might be possible for the party to hold on at its current 49 seats in the Senate or lose just one or two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political analysts said that probably is way too optimistic. But on the other hand, they say a scenario where Democrats expand their 51-seat majority to close to 60 seats also may be hard to achieve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout this year, Ensign had spread woe, saying it would be a good election night if Republicans lost just four Senate seats. The party is defending 23 seats, double the Democrats' number, and lagged in fundraising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It got to the point where some Republicans were complaining to reporters - anonymously, of course - that they were growing tired of the Nevadan's pessimism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin energized the prospects for GOP presidential nominee John McCain, there has been spillover to Senate candidates as well, Ensign said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin definitely gave a boost,&quot; Ensign said. &quot;In races where we were way down, those races are even, and in some of the races that were even, we are up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added Republicans expect Palin will boost GOP turnout in a big way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Republicans now face the prospect that Palin's magic touch might be fading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CBS News/New York Times national poll conducted Sept. 12-16 showed her favorable rating dropped four points in a week, to 40 percent, while her unfavorable rating grew by 8 points, to 30 percent, according to a CNN analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides a Palin bounce, Republicans gained momentum talking about oil drilling through the summer, Ensign said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fundraising also picked up, with Ensign's team surpassing its Democratic counterpart in August, $5.2 million to $4.4 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats still have a sizeable money lead, even after spending $13.7 million in August, mostly on TV ads in key states like North Carolina, Mississippi and Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Sept. 1, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had $33.7 million in the bank while the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee had $26.8 million.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I accept that political campaigns are deceitful and scurrilous affairs accepted by a public ignorant of government, its institutions, operational constraints and methods. But I am astonished at the duplicity of the latest Barack Obama political ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's bad enough to taunt John McCain, one of the Senate's leaders on technology, with being incapable of using computers when the truth lies in the injuries that hinder him. Such knowledge is readily available to the most novice Googler, so the Obama campaign's obvious motivation for the ad was to distort the truth - a gentlemen's euphemism for lying. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also heard an Obama&nbsp;ad blaming Sen. McCain and the Bush administration for the financial mess, a mess that began years ago, under President Clinton when the operational difference between commercial and investment banks was eliminated in a misbegotten notion that all citizens should own their own home regardless of financial ability and wherewithal - a mess begun and encouraged by both parties, lobbyists, toady corporate agents and accepted by the voters. We are all guilty of succumbing to greed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In accusing Sen. McCain of complicity, Sen. Obama ignores Sen. McCain's record. On May 25, 2006, Sen. McCain anticipated the problems of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and co-sponsored legislation to correct systemic abuses. For Sen. Obama to ignore Sen. McCain's history while he personally ranks third in total contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac donations is astounding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Obama's staffers really should become more proficient at research if they wish to attack Sen. McCain on his record. Oh, that's right. Sen. McCain has a record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to Sen. Obama, I still wait for one of his supporters to point out anything that he has accomplished.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My litmus test for national candidates will be an understanding of the holy trinity of a clean, renewable energy policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, we will never win the war on terror if we keep funding both sides. Currently, this country buys oil from Middle East regimes, who use oil profits to destabilize Iraq, Israel, etc. Military reactions drive up the price we are paying to undermine our own interests in the region. America needs to break that cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, moving from fossil fuels to green energy will help reduce global warming, which in turn also will alleviate the developing national and international water supply crisis that nobody is discussing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no silver bullet, but technologies such as plasma arc gasification, silicone-based solar cells, wind, smart appliances and ice energy seem promising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We the people have a role in developing these technologies, but the government must stay out of the business of picking private-sector winners. Tax credits to consumers and capital gains advantages for investors would encourage research into (and consumption of) these and other technologies including clean coal and into safe storage of nuclear waste. American jobs will follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, rising oil costs and falling alternative energy costs, along with local, national and international developments, make the green revolution an economic inevitability. But there will be no salvation if Russia, Venezuela or OPEC develop these technologies first. Imagine the post-World War II world if Einstein came in second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From now on, my candidates will have to see this big picture and bring it into focus for voters. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not about the breed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week I read letters calling for the banning of pit bulls in response to the attack that killed a 4-month-old baby in North Las Vegas. Dog attacks are horrible, especially when they are on children. But they are comparatively rare, which is why an attack makes headlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The animal control agents in your first report on the attack made a point of noting that it is not about the breed. Many dog experts agree. Banning a breed would not eliminate dog attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What would help is ensuring that people who own dogs train them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, like so much else, this would require money from the owners and from the cities and counties to enforce it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until people respond to the need to train their pets, not to shake or roll over, but to follow commands such as &quot;down&quot; and &quot;stay,&quot; the animals will respond to their instincts and not the requirements of our society.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest political conceit - the president must be e-mail savvy - deserves all the disdain that can be heaped upon it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case you missed it, the Barack Obama campaign contends anyone not computer &quot;literate&quot; isn't hip enough to occupy the Oval Office. I kid you not. Obama's commercial ridiculing John McCain goes like this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He admits he still doesn't know how to use a computer, can't send an e-mail. After one president who was out of touch, we just can't afford more of the same.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What an asinine assertion. First, let's get the obvious out of the way: The reason McCain doesn't spend time in front of a computer is not because he's out of touch, it's because he's physically unable to use a keyboard thanks to beatings received in a Vietnamese POW camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also can't comb his hair or tie his shoes, for the same reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Obama campaign brainchildren will backhandedly poke fun at a hero's war injuries, what other disabilities are up for ridicule? Might they taunt the blind for not driving enough to understand the plight of commuters? Or, how about jeering a wheelchair-bound adversary for not getting outdoors enough to know the need for wilderness areas?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the arrogance of tying computer use to human worthiness is the height of smug. It is the Elvis of condescension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not only untrue, it insults many people who, thank you very much, either elect not to join the computer rat race, or go into it kicking and screaming. They don't like computers, don't want to spend time with them and get ticked off by ill-mannered people who use them to the exclusion of gracious human interaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being computer independent doesn't make a person less worthy or useful in modern society. When the Obama campaign geeks laugh at McCain for not sending e-mail, they not only taunt a war hero's disability, they sneer at millions of Americans who prefer human contact to the self-absorption of a PDA. Somebody needs to tell Obama that this is not a smart idea in a tight election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most importantly, this kind of smugness reinforces what has become the primary reason the bloom has come off the rose of late with the Obama mystique: This guy's campaign has revealed itself to be just plain arrogant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're hip. We're cool. We're different. We're above politics. We're what the world's been waiting for. We e-mail. We text message. We blog. We Wii.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it was ever cute, it has now become unbearably self-centered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a funny thing, though. The know-it-alls at the Obama campaign were quick to offer contempt, albeit ignorantly, for an opponent's disability. But when it came to offering something enlightening about the woes of the U.S. economy last week, the Obama geeks had nothing substantive to say other than to mindlessly blame Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so the conceit comes full circle. As much as we might hope differently, arrogance rarely begets knowledgeable leadership, no matter how hip it may sound. You can take the &quot;smart&quot; out of &quot;smart-arse,&quot; but not the other way around.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pushing back against Republican John McCain's messages to the Hispanic community, the campaign of Democrat Barack Obama began airing Spanish-language commercials Wednesday that cast Republicans as anti-immigrant demagogues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They want us to forget the insults we've put up with, the intolerance,&quot; the 30-second television ad said. &quot;They made us feel marginalized in a country we love so much. John McCain and his Republican friends have two faces: one that tells lies just to get our vote and another that continues the failed policies of George Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that narration is playing, the image of conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh flashes on-screen with the quotation, &quot;Mexicans are stupid and unqualified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats said the tough ads were necessary to hit back at McCain, the GOP's presidential nominee, who has been airing Spanish-language ads that seem to lay the failure of the 2006 immigration reform bill at Obama's feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neutral arbiters have called McCain's ads deceptive because it was largely opposition from the right that torpedoed the immigration compromise McCain had once spearheaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most of the immigration debate, McCain drew fire from the right, including Limbaugh, who was often no fan of McCain's stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., a supporter of Obama's presidential bid, said Hispanics need to be reminded that McCain, once a driving force behind immigration reform, later abandoned the debate and did not stop his party from crafting a platform that endorses only border enforcement as the solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They want us to forget how John McCain walked away from us when it came time to choose between comprehensive legislation with his name on it and making nice with the right wing during the primaries,&quot; Menendez said during a Wednesday morning conference call with reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama supports a &quot;path to citizenship&quot; for some illegal immigrants in America, while McCain now contends that the border must be tightened before any other action is taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama ads, like the McCain ads that debuted last week, are airing in Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado, the three Western swing states with large Hispanic populations. Democrats are spending millions to generate unprecedented turnout among Hispanics, who favor Obama by a wide margin in most polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns have targeted Hispanics with ads in the past, but the latest round marks an increase in the intensity of both candidates' attacks on each other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget the proverbial fox in the henhouse. More fun are the hens in the Fox house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-cutups Jason Feinberg and Monica Jackson of &quot;Fox-5 News: Live in Las Vegas&quot; are (seriously!) the best reasons to gape at local a.m. yammer-fests. While surfing channels, you just need to appreciate morning news with a Mad magazine undertow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There must be a sign at KVVU-TV, Channel 5: &quot;Screw Propriety, 7-9 a.m. Weekdays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local shows - and even, in stretches, network flagships &quot;Today,&quot; &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;The Early Show&quot; - often are wrapped in a veneer of false chumminess and forced joie de vivre, their happy-and-happier patter painfully obvious as strained stabs at joviality. But Feinberg and Jackson go straight for slap-happy with riffs that can leave you giggling, groaning, smiling or praying someone dumps a truckload of decaf and the name of a competent therapist at the studio door - but at least offer authentic exchanges rather than antiseptic pleasantries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll tune in any news using Eddie Murphy's &quot;Boogie in Your Butt&quot; as fade-in music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like a puppy on a sugar rush, Feinberg is the impulsive chatterbox who often kick-starts the goofiness, as when insisting that Jackson - who gazes at him with affectionate exasperation - ask him on-camera what she intended strictly as off-camera prattle: Who has the bigger butt, J.Lo or Kim Kardashian? &quot;Why do you do this to me in public?&quot; she sighs as Feinberg finger-traces their ample assets in the air and declares Kardashian the prime rump roast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He ad-libs mock boos over tape of Republican conventioneers doing likewise during John McCain's speech attacking Barack Obama with the disclaimer, &quot;I was getting into it.&quot; He shows a picture of his cat at a computer, the &quot;kitty porn&quot; blurred out. He caps a story about a stamp-order request line rerouted to a phone-sex service with a breathy, 1-900-style voice-over. The dude's decorum filter is frequently on the fritz, refreshingly so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson toggles between eye-rolling mommy and campy cohort with robust humor. She'll occasionally jump the tracks: Witness her tantrum earlier this year, donning a tiara and suggesting R-J columnist Norm Clarke - who accurately reported her reporting inaccuracies during the Monte Carlo hotel fire - &quot;bow down&quot; to her. But even that is embarrassingly good TV, and the hint that she might spasm into some gonzo rant makes her watchable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her upbeat banter bouncing off Feinberg's kooky kibitzing cements their rapport. And weathercaster Ted Pretty's deadpan reactions - his sardonic mug makes it look like he's got permanent heartburn - cast him as George to their Gracie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amusing or asinine (often both), they at least appear free of fakery, and that's a feat. They favor spontaneous silliness over scripted stiffness. It's like a breakfast choice: Feel free to have oatmeal. I'll go with Count Chocula.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, the federal government has stepped in to bail out mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while the Treasury Department made a contrasting decision to stand aside and let Lehman Brothers investment bank seek bankruptcy protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another longtime Wall Street institution, Merrill Lynch, announced it would accept a discounted buyout from Bank of America. And on it goes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Predictably, Democrats immediately attempted to tie the growing financial crisis to Republicans by singling out &quot;the policies advocated by John McCain's former senior adviser,&quot; former Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They cite a 1999 law co-sponsored by Sen. Gramm that paved the way for consolidation between commercial and investment banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., made a scathing floor speech Tuesday morning in which he paid his standard unearned compliment to Herbert Hoover, using the name of &quot;the Great Engineer&quot; as a synonym for do-nothing-ism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least, we assume that's what he meant when he compared Sen. McCain's economic approach with that of the Hoover administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The same Phil Gramm who, as a senator, was responsible for deregulation in the financial services industries that paved the way for much of this crisis to occur,&quot; Sen. Reid clarified, presumably puzzling many busy workers at the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, since their agencies would no longer exist if the financial services industry had truly been &quot;deregulated&quot; a decade ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was Phil Gramm's legislation that now allows Wall Street traders to bid up the price of oil, leaving us to pay the bill,&quot; Sen. Reid said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out on the campaign trail, Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama blamed the falling dominos on &quot;the economic philosophy&quot; that he said Republican rival Sen. McCain shares with President Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The finger-pointing is fully expected, though it's clear there's plenty of blame for all. It was Democrat Bill Clinton who helped reshape the financial landscape in the late 1990s, after all, signing the bill that removed Depression-era barriers between commercial banks and investment firms as part of a shift in which Democrats sought to loosen up mortgage practices, complaining minority neighborhoods were being &quot;red-lined.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's equally clear more heavy-handed regulation of these institutions will be forthcoming no matter which candidate is elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it seems fair to ask what Sen. Obama means when he blames the current meltdown on &quot;the economic philosophy&quot; that he says Sen. McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, shares with President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What &quot;economic philosophy&quot; can he be referring to, and what would be his alternative?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As The Wall Street Journal, Investor's Business Daily and National Review day by day dig deeper into the associations that have formed the world view of this former Chicago &quot;community organizer&quot; with so little experience in the private sector - his childhood mentor, poet and Communist Party member Frank Marshall Davis; the patron saint of the modern &quot;community organizer,&quot; Saul &quot;The Red&quot; Alinsky; William Ayres of the Weather Underground; radical preacher Jeremiah Wright - it's hard to conclude he means anything but that &quot;the economic philosophy&quot; known as free-market capitalism is to blame, and that something else is needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Sen. Reid believes &quot;Wall Street traders&quot; should not be allowed to &quot;bid up the price of oil, leaving us to pay the bill,&quot; how would he stop them? By installing federal price controls on the price of oil? Former Soviet economic adviser Yuri Maltsev tells us how well that worked in the Soviet Union: &quot;The government guaranteed chicken would never sell for more than 40 kopeks, and it never did. Of course, there was no chicken in the stores.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Price controls always lead to shortages, rationing and black markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mind you, neither George W. Bush nor Sen. McCain is a radical free-market, laissez-faire kind of guy. If anything, Sen. McCain failed to light a fire under his conservative Republican base - until his selection of running mate Sarah Palin - precisely because he shares far too much of the taste for government meddling and regulation favored by Sens. Reid and Obama. (See &quot;McCain-Feingold.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sen. Obama has criticized an unnamed, underlying &quot;economic philosophy&quot; shared by President Bush and Sen. McCain, which can only be a code word for &quot;free-market capitalism&quot; - blaming that system for the current wave of defaulting mortgages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So he should now come straight with the American people. Which alternative economic system does he prefer, if not market-based capitalism?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama scheduled to visit Elko and Las Vegas today, Republicans welcomed him to Nevada by hitting the airwaves with attack ads on English and Spanish radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The English ad, which the Republican National Committee said would air on Las Vegas and Elko stations, turns Obama's own slogan against him, claiming that it is Republican nominee John McCain who will bring change to Washington, while electing Obama will merely lead to &quot;more of the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is scheduled to speak in Elko at 11 a.m. today, followed by a 5 p.m. Las Vegas rally at Cashman Field. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doors open at 2:30 p.m. for the Las Vegas rally, which is free and open to the public. Cashman Field, the 9,000-seat outdoor baseball stadium where the minor-league Las Vegas 51s play, is located downtown at 850 Las Vegas Boulevard North, near the intersection of Washington Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tickets are not required, but the Obama campaign encourages those who would like to attend the &quot;Change We Need&quot; rally to RSVP online at www.nv.barackobama.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and McCain are competing hard for votes in Nevada, where most polling shows a tight race as the election nears in less than two months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Elko, Obama heads into historically hostile territory for Democrats. In 2004, President Bush got four times as many votes in Elko County as Democratic nominee John Kerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With less than 15 percent of the state's registered voters living outside Clark and Washoe counties, some strategists wonder whether it's worth a Democrat's time to venture out to rural Nevada. But Obama's visit there today is his third in the past year and a half he's been campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign spokeswoman Kirsten Searer said Obama is determined to &quot;take his message of change to every corner of the state, including traditionally Republican areas. Republicans and Democrats are all frustrated with the past eight years, and they don't want more of the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Picking up on the seemingly endless refrain of &quot;change&quot; versus &quot;more of the same&quot; in this presidential campaign, Republicans - the party of President Bush - are attempting to steal some of Obama's thunder with the radio ads timed to his visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Change or more of the same? That's the argument Barack Obama has been trying to make,&quot; a narrator says in the ad. &quot;What about pork-barrel spending? In 20-plus years in the Senate, John McCain has never sought an earmark. Not once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An earmark typically directs a specific amount of money to a project in a lawmaker's home state or district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, the ad charges, has &quot;requested nearly a billion dollars in earmarks&quot; since becoming a senator in early 2005. &quot;John McCain and (vice presidential nominee) Sarah Palin will shake up Washington,&quot; it states. &quot;Barack Obama: more of the same and opposed to real reform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign fired back by noting that McCain has been in Washington for nearly three decades and suggested he's part of the problem when it comes to the economy. Spokeswoman Searer said voters won't buy the idea that McCain, who has supported most Bush policies, can turn things around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just now, John McCain and his strategists have belatedly come to the realization that after eight disastrous years, Americans are demanding change,&quot; she said. &quot;We welcome that debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A different Republican ad is scheduled to start airing on Spanish-language radio stations in Las Vegas today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echoing previous McCain campaign attacks, it charges that Obama tried to kill the compromise immigration legislation that McCain sponsored in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama backed amendments supported by labor unions that some termed &quot;poison pills&quot; because they would have made the legislation less palatable to some in its fragile coalition of support. But supporters of comprehensive immigration reform consider Obama an ally, while McCain later backed away from the issue, which was costing him support from conservative Republicans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls conducted since the political conventions show Republican John McCain in the lead in the presidential race in Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Zogby International poll of 572 likely Nevada voters conducted last Tuesday through Friday found McCain getting 50.1 percent of the vote to Democrat Barack Obama's 42.5 percent. The online survey carries a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points, and its result convinced the pollster to change the state from purple to red on the electoral map.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're turning it red for now,&quot; states a note on the poll on Zogby's Web site. &quot;McCain is close to 50 percent, and he now holds a seven-point lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another pollster, Rasmussen Reports, still rates Nevada a toss-up, with a new poll that has McCain favored but within the margin of error. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rasmussen's automated telephone poll, conducted Thursday, found 49 percent of Nevada voters supporting McCain and 46 percent for Obama. The firm's August poll also had McCain ahead, 45 percent to 42 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both results are within the 4 point margin of error of the survey of 700 likely voters. They appear to show McCain maintaining a slim lead as more voters make up their minds with the election nearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty-eight percent of Nevadans had a favorable view of McCain in the poll, while 53 percent viewed Obama favorably. Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin was viewed favorably by 54 percent; Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden was seen in a favorable light by 52 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third recent poll of 518 likely voters statewide found an even tighter race. Conducted Wednesday, the InsiderAdvantage/Poll Position survey put McCain ahead, 46 percent to 45 percent, with a 4.2 point margin of error in either direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama drew 59 percent of the Hispanic vote in that poll to McCain's 38 percent, while McCain led among independents, 45 percent to 40 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most analysts are expecting a close finish on Election Day. In 2004, President Bush won Nevada by 2.6 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP GRUMBLES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Republicans are growing unhappy with Sen. John Ensign's blunt talk about the party's chances in U.S. Senate races this fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever since the Nevadan took over chairmanship of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, he has acknowledged the GOP faces long odds to success. Republicans have 23 Senate seats to defend, almost double that of Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have been saddled with an unpopular president, key retirements and unfortunate surprises like the indictment of veteran Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens and Idaho Sen. Larry Craig's arrest in a men's restroom at the Minneapolis airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NRSC also has been unable to match energized Democrats in fundraising. Through July, the GOP committee has $25.4 million available to spend while its Democratic counterpart has $42.9 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only lately have the emergence of popular vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and the resurgence of John McCain's presidential campaign given Republicans some hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensign has scolded fellow Republican senators for not opening their wallets wide enough to help in Senate races. He's also said he would consider it a success if Republicans only lose four Senate seats on election night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Ensign put out a news release saying he had to cut back on television ad buys because Republican senators were not coming through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may have been what prompted a report this week in Politico, the campaign and politics newspaper and Web site, where Ensign was a target for criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Republican senator was quoted calling Ensign a &quot;defeatist&quot; while other GOPers said the Nevadan may be hurting his chances to climb the party leadership ladder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the critics were identified by name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensign declined to comment on the criticism. He has said in the past he just &quot;told the truth,&quot; and was being realistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the timing may have been coincidental, someone at the NRSC leaked an internal spreadsheet showing only 13 Republican senators had met their fundraising goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most successful fundraiser? Ensign, who raised more than $9 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensign's defenders said the Nevadan stepped up and took a job that nobody else wanted. Most everyone knew this was going to be a thankless year for the Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I HARRY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid may not have many fans on the Republican side of the aisle, but he has a big supporter in Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was in Las Vegas this week to discuss the musical score he co-wrote for the renovation of The Mirage volcano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his friendship with Reid goes back to 1991, when he testified in front of a Senate subcommittee Reid was chairing on aging matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hart said Reid helped Hart gain $1 million in federal money for the study of music therapy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Harry kick-started the whole musical therapy thing in the West,&quot; Hart said. &quot;Harry is a visionary, even back to 1991.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'DUMP, BABY, DUMP'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could Rep. Shelley Berkley get the plan to store radioactive waste at Nevada's Yucca Mountain branded as an example of pork-barrel politics?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In news releases last week, Berkley blasted the project as a &quot;$100 billion ... pile of radioactive pork,&quot; and &quot;John McCain's 'Nuclear Bridge to Nowhere,'&quot; a reference to the proposed $400 million bridge to Ketchikan, Alaska, that became a potent symbol of wasteful federal spending in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bridge controversy has been reignited by McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who has been claiming on the stump that she opposed the project to bolster her credentials as a reformer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the claim has been largely discredited by critics who note that Palin actually supported the bridge until it became politically radioactive, so to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berkley also riffed on Republicans' chants of &quot;drill, baby, drill&quot; at their convention, saying the push for Yucca resembles the drive for offshore oil drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats want Nevada to be a leader in clean energy, Republicans want to make Nevada a trash can for the nuclear industry,&quot; Berkley said in a news release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have one goal - dump, baby, dump - and they cannot wait to get toxic radioactive waste to Nevada given the chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Energy has estimated that the Yucca project could run to $96.2 billion. McCain supports the repository, which he says can be made safe, while Obama has said he would stop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama to speak at Cashman field</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he visits Las Vegas on Wednesday, Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama will speak at the city's minor-league baseball stadium, according to his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is scheduled to hold a Wednesday evening rally at Cashman Field, the 9,000-seat outdoor venue that is home to the Las Vegas 51s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doors open at 2:30 p.m. for the rally, which is free and open to the public. The program is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. The Obama campaign is encouraging attendees to RSVP at www.nv.barackobama.com for the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Las Vegas visit, Obama's first to Southern Nevada since an invitation-only discussion on energy in mid-June, will be the candidate's second stop of the day in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's also scheduled to appear in Elko, where he'll hold a Wednesday morning rally in the northeastern Nevada town's Main City Park on Idaho Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the rest of rural Nevada, Elko is heavily Republican, but Obama is making his third trip there. He was there in August 2007 and again in January in the runup to the Jan. 19 Democratic caucuses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeking to drive a wedge into Democrat Barack Obama's strong support from Hispanic voters and peel off voters in a key demographic, Hispanic organizers for Republican John McCain are quietly mounting a major push on the abortion issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With literature, outreach to clergy and events targeting the community, McCain supporters are aggressively spreading the word, seeking to convince this mostly Catholic voting bloc that they have a moral obligation to support McCain, who opposes abortion rights, over Obama, who favors them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are telling them, 'If you are Hispanic and a Christian, you should vote with your principles,'&quot; said Tibi Ellis, a Las Vegas business owner and co-chairwoman of the national Latinas for McCain coalition, which held a gathering in Las Vegas last week. &quot;Our job is to inform Hispanic voters that Senator Obama is against life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, Ellis said, Hispanic voters she talks to are often shocked to learn about Obama's opposition to a bill in the Illinois state Senate that would have required that medical aid be rendered to babies who survive failed abortions. &quot;That's more extreme than just being for choice,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opponents of abortion including the National Right to Life Committee say Obama's votes against the measure are tantamount to an admission that he favors allowing babies to be killed. Obama has said he favors no such thing; he says he opposed the bill in question because it wasn't necessary, as doctors were already required to save such fetuses, and because it could have interfered with abortions' availability in his state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanics are a diverse group, Ellis said, representing many nationalities and income levels, but they agree on values. &quot;Let's come together and celebrate our similarities,&quot; she said. &quot;What is important to us is our Christian faith. That resonates in our communities. If you are an executive or a labor worker, we meet together in church on Sundays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otto Merida, who chairs McCain's committee of Nevada Hispanic supporters and is also president and CEO of the Las Vegas Latin Chamber of Commerce, said the effort to get Hispanics to be politically engaged is more intensive than any previous election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been biweekly meetings with ministers, he said, urging them to inform their respective flocks about such issues, and volunteer phone-call campaigns. With the election expected to be decided by a razor-thin margin in Nevada, a good turnout of pro-McCain Hispanics &quot;can make the difference in the state of Nevada,&quot; Merida said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week's Latinas for McCain event, held at a ballroom called the Palacio Del Sol in the Commercial Center complex on East Sahara Avenue in downtown Las Vegas, was not well-attended. Perhaps 50 people trickled in to a space set up to accommodate 200 or more; tables held displays celebrating different Latin American countries and their cultures, from Colombia to Venezuela to Mexico, and children in brightly colored ponchos and ruffled dresses performed traditional dances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost all the fliers on the front table focused on abortion and other hot-button social issues, from a &quot;Voter's Guide for Serious Catholics&quot; by a group called Catholic Answers Action to a comparison of Obama and McCain by an ostensibly nonpartisan group called Priests for Life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Postcards on every table touted McCain's &quot;consistent pro-family voting record&quot; and said that as president he would &quot;vigorously defend the right to life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fernando Romero, a longtime Nevada Hispanic organizer and a Democrat who crossed party lines to lead McCain's Hispanic outreach effort in the state, said the campaign is &quot;doing a lot of events that have pro-life as the undercurrent. I think people are listening. People are looking at their conscience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Hispanics he talks to, he said, were troubled by Obama's answer, in a forum with both candidates at California's Saddleback Church, to a question about when life begins that he considered such a matter &quot;above my pay grade.&quot; (McCain, asked the same question, replied that life begins at conception.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls have shown strong support for Obama in the Hispanic community, which analysts say has soured on the Republican Party since the immigration uproar of 2006, when tens of thousands marched in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a poll conducted last month for NDN, formerly the New Democrat Network, 62 percent of Nevada Hispanic voters supported Obama, while just 20 percent supported McCain and 18 percent were undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls of Hispanics in this and other Southwestern states where they make up a growing part of the population, and the electorate, have shown similar results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he acknowledges that many Hispanics are strongly committed to the Democratic Party, Romero believes Hispanic support for Obama is relatively tentative and susceptible to persuasion. He predicts McCain can take as much as half of the Hispanic vote here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats say Hispanic voters are most concerned with bread-and-butter issues, not the divisive social issues that played such a large role in President Bush's campaigns. They see Republican attempts to emphasize &quot;values&quot; over economics as manipulative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hispanic voters are more concerned about bigger, more important issues - the economy, education, immigration and health care - before abortion,&quot; said Nevada Assembly&shy;man Ruben Kihuen, D-Las Vegas, who is Hispanic. &quot;Being a socially conservative Democrat, I can speak from my own experience. We're socially conservative because we're Catholics, but before we look at that issue we need a job, we need health care, we need education for our children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Republicans are seeking to emphasize abortion, he said, &quot;It's an attempt to try to divert from the actual issues affecting everyday, working-class people. My constituents have not brought that up at all. ... That's taking it too far, and I think people will see through it that it's politically driven. If it were an issue people bring up on a day-to-day basis, fine, but I think people are smart enough to see that it's just a way to get votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam J. Segal, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Hispanic Voter Project of Johns Hopkins University, said targeting the Hispanic community with values-based messages was a hallmark of former Bush adviser Karl Rove's strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That would be basically replaying the last election, the strategy from the Bush campaign,&quot; he said. In 2004, he said, Spanish-language ads for Bush included messages about abortion and gay marriage that weren't in the English-language scripts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he questioned whether such an approach would be effective in the changed environment of 2008, when polling indicates that Hispanic voters are more hostile to Republicans and are mostly concerned about the economy and the war in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that Hispanics by more than a two-to-one margin have a strong affinity for the Democratic Party, that's really the main factor&quot; driving the Hispanic vote in this election, Segal said. &quot;All the other election-year politicking plays a part at the margins. But the margins are where elections are won and lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many technical and financial reasons why this nearly century-old technology will likely fail in the national marketplace. However, rather than focus on those issues, we want to specifically address why such a proposal would be resoundingly detrimental and unworkable for Nevada's energy future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed facilities you cited all share two characteristics: ready access to coal and abundant supplies of water. Nevada has neither.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All coal for this process would have to be imported into Nevada at substantial cost. Thus, the cost of importing coal to a Nevada plant makes such a facility uncompetitive with a mine-sited operation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, these facilities utilize incredible amounts of water. For instance, the Crow Tribe of Montana development proposal you noted requires the tribe to commit up to 50,000 acre-feet of water each year to the plant for a single 50,000-barrel-per-day facility - more than 20 gallons of water for each gallon of fuel produced. In contrast, the Southern Nevada Water Authority hopes at some point in the future to import between 40,000 and 60,000 acre feet of water from Spring Valley in White Pine County for the residential and commercial needs of Southern Nevada. If our state's future is to be assured, we simply do not have the excess water resources to squander on coal-to-liquid fuel production in Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another constraint, as noted by the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, is that Nevada is not suited for sequestering CO2 underground. The costs and regulatory burdens of a pipeline to move the CO2 to a potential sequestration site would make an already uncompetitive project even more so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An additional concern for such a project in Nevada as well as other locations is that investment capital for carbon intensive projects evaporated earlier this year after major investment banks adopted &quot;carbon principles&quot; to evaluate the future economic risks such projects entail. Contrary to your editorial, each of these projects is premised on substantial government subsidies or incentives largely due to the fact that commercial-scale carbon sequestration has never been proved financially or technologically feasible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada and the Southwest do have the resources necessary to lead the nation in a 21st-century energy policy that protects consumers and the environment as the nation's transportation infrastructure evolves into a more sustainable model that's less dependent on fossil fuels. Properly developed, Nevada's solar, wind and geothermal potential alone far exceeds our electricity demand, allowing Nevada to become an exporter of green energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incorporating 21st century technologies, such as combining plug-in hybrid vehicles or electric vehicles with a &quot;smart&quot; electric grid, and other distributed energy sources such as fuel cells and rooftop solar installations, will create jobs, help regain the nation's technological edge and address the growing concerns about fossil fuels and related CO2 emissions. Both GM and Toyota intend to market plug-in hybrid vehicles by the 2010 model year, and investment in the nation's electric grid and new technologies is a more rational approach than investing tens of billions of dollars in outdated and carbon-intensive coal-to-liquid fuel plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada is an ideal place to start this transition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TIMOTHY HAY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RENO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wellinghoff was Nevada's first consumer advocate and was recently reappointed by President Bush to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a second term. Mr. Hay is a former consumer advocate and former member of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Way out there</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erin Neff's Thursday column, &quot;Code words can't obscure GOP's racial politics,&quot; was a real piece of work. I suggest that she check to find out what they put in the Kool-Aid at the Democratic National Convention that causes paranoia. Her conclusion that the comments of Sarah Palin and Rudy Giuliani are coded racist remarks is comparable to the recent Newsweek article that claimed if you didn't vote for Barack Obama, you were a racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's look at the issue at hand. We are trying to select the CEO of the most powerful country in the world. The real question that Gov. Palin, the GOP's vice presidential nominee, and Mr. Giuliani raised in their speeches was not about the sincerity and value of community organizers, but what skills, attributes and executive experience Sen. Obama gathered to qualify him to be president. We are all trying to decide who we want to be the leader of the free world. To raise that question is not a racist issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters want to know what qualifies Sen. Obama to be our president. Give me three things, other than writing a couple of books about himself, that Sen. Obama has accomplished. Give me one important decision he has made where the success or failure and the resultant credit or blame fell squarely on his shoulders. Where is an example of courage to take risks, rather than to verbally equivocate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one area where we agree is that some of these sound bites taken out of context are an unnecessary distraction. Both sides are guilty. Sen. Obama's &quot;lipstick&quot; comment was taken out of context, as was Sen. John McCain's remark about being in Iraq for 100 years and about $5 million making someone rich. The worn-out, repeated DNC talking point that a McCain presidency amounts to a third Bush term falls in the same category.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is all nonsense! The ridiculous charges and countercharges could easily be dealt with in a stand-alone town hall meeting, where each could confront the other. Just where is the man who claimed he would debate Sen. McCain anytime, anywhere - hiding behind his teleprompter, I suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contrived indignation of both parties over twisted quotes and out-of-control supporters and surrogates is almost humorous until you realize that people do take them seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Ms. Neff to contrive the Palin and Giuliani remarks as racist is completely out of bounds. Sen. Obama is the only candidate who has raised his race as an issue. Objectivity does not have to be an attribute of a left-wing columnist, so I guess we'll just have to cut her some slack.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a reach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding Erin Neff's Thursday Review-Journal column and Rudy Giuliani's statement that he doesn't know what a community organizer does, how does that constitute code relating to Sen. Barack Obama's race? Are all &quot;community organizers&quot; black? I don't think so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides that, does Mr. Giulaini need to send us code words that Sen. Obama is black, or do you think we can figure that out on our own?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political fraud</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've seen TV ads sponsored by &quot;Divided We Fail&quot; claiming that &quot;1.85 million Americans go bankrupt due to medical bills in one year.&quot; That number seemed high to me. I visited the group's Web site, which is linked to AARP, to see if I'd heard wrong, but the site claims &quot;millions&quot; each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wondered about their methodology. How had they determined that medical bills were a significant factor in bankruptcy filings? Looking into that, however, I found that the total U.S. bankruptcies were just under 1 million last year, and that was up from prior years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So where, exactly, did the 1.85 million come from? Apparently, you don't actually have to file for bankruptcy for AARP to claim you've been bankrupted by medical bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my opinion, this goes way beyond simply massaging legitimate statistics to fit an agenda and borders on fraud. I'd love to hear an AARP representative explain how they cooked up their numbers, but I doubt we will.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign is on the offensive, sensing momentum. But it risks hitting a wall if it gets bogged down in silliness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the recent &quot;controversy&quot; over remarks Democrat Barack Obama made Tuesday, echoing the constant DNC talking point that a McCain presidency would represent four more years of George W. Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can put lipstick on a pig,&quot; Sen. Obama said. &quot;It's still a pig. You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change. It's still going to stink after eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain camp responded as if the Democrat had accused his GOP opponent of hating hot dogs, baseball and apple pie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarks were &quot;offensive and disgraceful&quot; said a spokesman for Sen. John McCain, claiming the &quot;pig&quot; reference was a shot at the GOP vice presidential nominee, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeah, sure. Does anybody believe that Sen. Obama is a raging sexist who would label Gov. Palin a pig? Of course not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thankfully, Sen. Obama refused to apologize for using a one-liner that has become part of the common vernacular over the past few years. Instead, he called out the McCain campaign for exhibiting the same sense of exaggerated outrage that so often characterizes today's hypersensitive, politically correct culture of victimology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They seize on an innocent remark, try to take it out of context, throw up an outrageous ad because they know that it's catnip for the news media,&quot; Sen. Obama said. &quot;This whole thing about lipstick, nobody actually believes that these folks are offended. Oh, we're shocked. Everybody knows it's cynical, everybody knows it's insincere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's right, and refreshingly so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britney Spears won three big awards at Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards. It will be called a comeback. And at the same time, she got revenge against John McCain for running an attack ad vilifying Britney and Paris Hilton for being &quot;celebrities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris claimed vengeance last month when she made a response video, calling McCain &quot;that wrinkly white-haired guy&quot; from &quot;the olden days.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Sunday's VMAs, host Russell Brand (a British comic) pleaded, &quot;Please elect Barack Obama.&quot; Britney clapped approvingly. So there you go. Britney supports Obama, apparently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, the VMAs gave Britney statues for video of the year, best pop video and best female video for &quot;Piece of Me.&quot; She was calm. She merely thanked God, her &quot;boys,&quot; her family and fans. She didn't perform as viewers might have expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you remember, a year ago, she self-destructed at the VMAs here in Las Vegas in a fit of messy hair, a fluffy body (for her) and a floppy dress while she performed like a drunk goat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She took no chances this time. As the show's first stage talker in a Hollywood studio, she barely said a thing in less than a minute, even though MTV's whole promotional campaign centered around her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you think it's dumb that Britney, Paris and the VMAs went political, remember that McCain started it. And Sunday's VMA host spread the response to cover McCain's running mate Sarah Palin's pregnant daughter's 18-year-old boyfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brand said he felt sorry for the &quot;poor teenage father-boy&quot; because one minute he was having &quot;joyful unprotected sex&quot; and the next, he was whisked away as a prop at the Republican National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that is the best safe-sex message of all time. Use a condom or become Republican,&quot; Brand said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britney aside or included, this was maybe the worst VMAs, celebrating its 25th anniversary. Brand was no Chris Rock or Kathy Griffin. Award presenters and winners weren't interesting or funny. And some singers seemed to be lip-syncing, though it was hard to tell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only good stuff? Christina Aguilera sang &quot;Keeps Gettin' Better,&quot; a great song, while prancing around in some kind of Catwoman outfit. Kanye West sounded great on an excellently stark, dark stage - even though he claimed last year, after losing, he'd never do the VMAs again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Pink performed &quot;So What&quot; well, while sliding down a Cirque du Soleil-type curtain from the second floor window of a Hollywood studio fa&ccedil;ade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other performances seemed small, including the Jonas Brothers' playing their dinky lullaby, &quot;Love Bug.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katy (&quot;I Kissed A Girl&quot;) Perry eeked out a cover of Madonna's &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; but used a cheat sheet to nail the lyrics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pussycat Dolls won best dancing in a video, then one of the Pussycats resurrected decrepit street lingo: &quot;We want to thank (director) Joseph Kahn for doing this dope video.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The red carpet was also a terrible bore of attendees saying nothing (&quot;I'm wearing Gucci&quot;) while constantly plugging a mobile phone sponsor. Only MTV News correspondent Jim Cantiello made one complete thought worth hearing:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am so relieved that there is an elephant on the red carpet. There was this distinct odor. I was worried that Amy Winehouse was stumbling down the carpet somewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so it seems that the formerly funny and fascinating MTV Awards has devolved into being like a red carpet at a Las Vegas nightclub. Musicians mostly are expected just to make an appearance, to show up. Look at Britney, all grown up and sober. Couldn't she have fallen down or something?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada officially cast its votes for the Republican nomination in Wednesday night's roll call on the floor of the convention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first time around, Nevada was one of several states that passed so the roll call could come back to John McCain's home state of Arizona to put him over the top. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Madam Secretary, I'm Sue Lowden, chairman of the Nevada Republican Party and a hockey mom,&quot; Lowden said into the microphone when the state's turn came. &quot;On behalf of our lieutenant governor, Brian Krolicki, who is head of the Nevada McCain campaign, Nevada passes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next time around, Lowden had a commercial pitch for the tourism industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Madam Secretary, from the Battle Born state, Nevada, the fastest growing state in the country, a great place to live, work and retire and the best place on earth to have a vacation - the Nevada delegates vote 34 votes, it's a unanimous vote, for a true American hero, a reform with results, a senator with substance - our next president of the United States of America, Senator John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REMEMBERING REID</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada Sen. Harry Reid got a couple shout-outs, none positive, on the floor of Wednesday's Republican convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani brought up the Senate majority leader's comment, more than a year ago, that &quot;this war is lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, if America lost, who won?&quot; he said. &quot;Al-Qaida? Bin Laden? In the single biggest political decision of this election, John McCain got it right; Barack Obama got it wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin noted a more recent remark of Reid's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Harry Reid&quot; - the mere mention of his name produced resounding boos from the convention floor - &quot;the majority leader of the current do-nothing Senate, he said, quote, 'I can't stand John McCain.' Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps no accolade we've heard this week provides better proof we've chosen the right man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly, what the majority (leader) was driving at is that he can't stand up to John McCain,&quot; Palin said. &quot;That's only one more reason to take the maverick out of the Senate and put him up to the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HISPANIC REPUBLICANS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats and Republicans agree on one thing: the importance of the Hispanic vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Danny Vargas heads the 37-year-old Republican National Hispanic Assembly with a chapter in Nevada formed last year. He said John McCain has the potential to do well with Hispanic voters, whom he noted have supported him in his Senate campaigns in Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls have shown Hispanics back Democrat Barack Obama by a wide margin over McCain, both nationally and in Nevada. Vargas brushed them off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He acknowledged the Republican name has been damaged in Hispanic eyes, largely thanks to &quot;the tone and tenor of the immigration debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans have to be about reasonable, rational, pragmatic solutions,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hispanics are independent, self-reliant, entrepreneurial, freedom-loving people,&quot; he said. &quot;Those are wholly Republican principles.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris Hilton is appearing in another campaign ad, this time in a House race in San Diego.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long-shot Democratic challenger Nick Leibham compares the heiress unfavorably to his Republican opponent, incumbent Brian Bilbray. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial is set to air Thursday before GOP presidential nominee John McCain addresses the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It pictures Hilton and Bilbray side by side Hilton in a bikini and Bilbray in a Hawaiian shirt. It says both are notable for doing nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes on the heels of a McCain&nbsp;ad that compared the celebrity of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama to that of Hilton. Never one to miss a marketing opportunity, Hilton quickly posted a clever comeback to the McCain&nbsp;ad. The video showed her in a spoof commercial detailing her own plan for energy independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Hilton's manager did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Leibham commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign aides for Leibham, a lawyer, say the ad will begin running Thursday on all four major networks in the San Diego area. They declined to say how much they were spending.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. PAUL, Minn. - The Nevada Republican Party was deemed so inept last week by the Republican National Committee over its delegate selection process that its delegation couldn't get a sponsor for breakfast. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who ever heard of a Republican not being able to find a lobbyist? But that's where the lack of love for Nevada ended here in the Twin Cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the perfect storm of political and natural events that turned the public face of this celebration on Monday into a funeral, these Nevada delegates are getting plenty of inspiration. More on that later. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a few thousand protesters were milling around downtown Monday morning and trying to accumulate around the capitol building. Just as Gustav officially made landfall southwest of New Orleans, the protesters were hoping to rain a surge of anti-McCain sentiment for the world's press to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We drove in from Milwaukee because we cannot let the Republicans show off their message of war and breaks for the rich without letting the common Americans know that we are here to try to balance that BS,&quot; said Amanda Benson, 20, wearing a shirt that read &quot;Bush Lied.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout downtown, this stalled convention is still having trouble getting into party mode. The campaign is in a tough position monitoring events in the Gulf Coast and fearful of a split-screen depicting mirth against sorrow, or even worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timing is everything in politics and McCain worked hard to halt Obama's momentum after the Democrat's successful acceptance speech last week with his own short-term bump over the announcement of his running mate, Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week was designed to build on what the campaign calls a &quot;historic&quot; moment. But from the outside, this convention feels like a plane in a holding pattern circling above until the protests and the storms subside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the delegation hotel, it was all business as usual, with the added benefit of an impromptu passing of the hat and prayers - lots of prayers - for hurricane victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, fresh off his newfound public disgust about lobbyists, tapped uber-lobbyist Charlie Black to speak to the Nevada luncheon. Black, a top campaign adviser, told Fortune magazine back in June that another terrorist attack inside the United States would help McCain. &quot;Certainly it would be a big advantage to him,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a lobbyist he represented the likes of Ferdinand Marcos and Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire, but he claims he always cleared his stuff with the State Department first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe he's just playing in the new lobbying world, which by only two-degrees of separation can go from Black to Mark Penn to Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it sure sounds a lot like more of the same from here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black was strictly on message, saying he had the first non-political conversation with McCain that he's had in 30 years. McCain's message to the delegation: &quot;Tell them to pray for the people of Louisiana and the other Gulf states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black actually said &quot;pray&quot; three times and then urged the delegates to &quot;participate financially&quot; for the hurricane relief efforts. &quot;You might not always agree with every position (McCain) takes   but you will always know that he arrived at that decision by putting self second and the country first,&quot; Black said. He also said McCain would be in Nevada &quot;a lot&quot; during the remainder of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's 95-year-old mother, Roberta, looked fabulous as she addressed the delegation, thanking them for having her and their work for &quot;God and their country.&quot; In and out in two minutes, lots of pictures. No questions. Darn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain likes to surround himself with strong women,&quot; Nevada GOP Chair Sue Lowden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne, the former Idaho governor, also made the rounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Way back when Kempthorne was a senator, he rarely met an environmental issue he didn't champion - for commercial interests. Whether agitating to change the Endangered Species Act or the Safe Drinking Water Act or opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Preserve to drilling. Kempthorne minced no words, mixing his official business with his political duties - reminding the delegates that McCain is &quot;strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates are awash in the country-first theme of the campaign. Retired Air Force Col. Bill Elander, a Medal of Honor winner and delegate from Sparks, introduced fellow former POWs for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retired Navy Capt. Jerry Coffee did his best woody woodpecker, describing the tap code POWs developed to communicate. He encouraged delegates to &quot;work hard,&quot; especially through their churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegates will get plenty more fired up at the Arizona breakfast today. The headliner is Grover Norquist of the National Taxpayers Association.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have preached from this bully pulpit for years that the best response to free speech you hate is more free speech - back and forth, to and fro until truth emerges victorious on the honorable field of bloodless verbal battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that seldom seems to be the way it works out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nay, the knives come out and demands for revenge escalate, from cries for apology or demotion or firing to threats of boycott to beheading to casting into the auto-de-f&eacute; for having the audacity to speak heresy of the Gospel According to Barack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such behavior was on full-throated display after Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois picked Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware to be his running mate in his bid for the presidency, and The Associated Press Washington Bureau Chief Ron Fournier penned an &quot;analysis&quot; piece for the wire service saying, &quot;The candidate of change went with the status quo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end, the article mentioned a 2007 ABC interview in which Biden said Obama was not ready to serve as president. The last line stated, &quot;It seems Obama is worried that some voters are starting to agree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fournier's penchant for adding an ample dose of how and why to the standard who, what and when prompted much hand-wringing and navel-gazing when he was appointed to head the bureau in May. Fournier calls it accountability journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Write with authority,&quot; he wrote in a memo to AP staffers a year before his promotion. &quot;The AP's hard-earned reputation for fairness and nonpartisanship must not be used as an excuse for fuzzy language when a clear voice is demanded, nor should it force us to give both sides of a story equal play when one side is plainly wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem many journalists have with that is: Whose role is it to decide which side is plainly wrong? (That's why I'm not a big fan of &quot;analysis&quot; pieces among the news columns, though they can have a role if written with even-handedness and clearly labeled as such.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 18 people in the Review-Journal's circulation area - I hesitate to call them all readers - had no such compunctions and e-mailed the paper in high dudgeon, voicing various demands as to what to do about Mr. Fournier and The AP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They called him biased, a propagandizer and a beta weasel. They compared him to Fox News, said he was in contact with Karl Rove, and said he consistently smears Democrats and favors the GOP's Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One lady wrote: &quot;Fournier needs to go. NOW. ... I'm tired of having my constitutional rights trampled on. It's MY constitution and MY country and I want it back. Fournier does absolutely NOTHING to further those goals in any way, shape or form. I hope he's investigated for propagandizing the media too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was one minor problem with this wailing to the Review-Journal. We never published the piece in question. It appears all or most of the missives were generated from a MoveOn.org Web site that listed talking points and encouraged viewers to type their ZIP codes into a box that then linked to e-mail addresses of newspapers in their area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I replied to all asking whether they'd actually read the Fournier article, but only a handful said they had, possibly after I'd asked. Few grasped the apparently slippery concept that differentiates straight news from analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next, there's the case of the television commercial produced by an independent organization that spells out the longtime ties Obama has to unrepentant domestic terrorist William Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after it aired, the Obama campaign answered with a rebuttal denying any ties to Ayers, trying to blame McCain for the ad and protesting that it brings up crimes committed by Ayers - a dozen bombings in early 1970s that included a New York City police headquarters, the U.S. Capitol and the Pentagon - when Obama was 8 years old. If left at that, all well and good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no, the earth must be scorched. An Obama lawyer wrote to the TV stations airing the ads threatening them and suggesting their broadcast licenses could be in jeopardy for &quot;accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama supporters deluged the stations with 93,000 e-mails, many threatening boycotts of the stations and their advertisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama campaign lawyer wrote the Justice Department demanding an investigation of &quot;a knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law.&quot; Might that be the McCain-Feingold election law?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that weren't enough, a company that filmed a documentary on Ayers' Weather Underground is claiming copyright violations, saying the ad steals footage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have flung their sheaths away and their blades thirst for blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Mitchell is editor of the Review-Journal and writes about free speech and the role of the press. He may be contacted by 383-0261 or via e-mail at tmitchell@ reviewjournal.com.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">D; Pg. 2D</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">801 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest concern about GOP Sen. John McCain choosing little-known Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential nominee should be obvious:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party has energized the political process over the past year by conducting a primary campaign primarily between a woman and a younger, dynamic African-American. Next to Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. McCain faces an uphill battle to shake the &quot;old fogey&quot; label. Under the circumstances, it doesn't take much cynicism to imagine the Arizona senator and his advisers believing they needed a woman or minority on the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the politics of groups and pigeonholes, and that's unfortunate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, elections are waged in the real world, and regardless of how Sen. McCain narrowed his choice to Gov. Palin, the question now is whether she is an honest and dynamic leader representing &quot;change&quot; from Washington's wasteful business as usual - and secondarily whether she can attract the necessary few extra votes in half a dozen &quot;swing&quot; states (including Nevada) to prevail in what shapes up to be another tight presidential contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Palin has as many years of public service as Sen. Obama (five more, actually), so that issue is a wash - except that the Democrats have chosen to put their relative newcomer at the top of the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a glance at Gov. Palin's political resume and personal history should prove heartening to voters who really seek &quot;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A life member of the National Rifle Association, Sarah Palin would sometimes rise at 3 a.m. to hunt moose with her father before school. She was point guard and captain of her high school's 1982 state championship basketball team and the 1984 runner-up in the Miss Alaska pageant, receiving a scholarship that allowed her to attend the University of Idaho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After working as a sports reporter at an Anchorage television station, Ms. Palin served two terms on the Wasilla, Alaska, City Council from 1992 to 1996, when she challenged the incumbent mayor, criticizing wasteful spending and high taxes. Winning that election, she kept her campaign promises, cutting her own salary and reducing property taxes by 60 percent. She was elected president of the Alaska Conference of Mayors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appointed Ethics Commissioner of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, she resigned in 2004 in protest over what she called the &quot;lack of ethics&quot; of fellow Alaskan Republican leaders, who ignored her whistle-blowing complaints. After she resigned, she exposed the state Republican Party's chairman for doing work for the party on public time. He resigned and paid a record fine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin ran a clean-up-government campaign for governor in 2006, charging ethical violations by state Republican Party leaders. She upset then-Gov. Frank Murkowski in the Republican gubernatorial primary and then - despite a lack of support from party leaders and a far smaller war chest than her opponent - went on to win the general election, defeating former Gov. Tony Knowles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Palin successfully killed the &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; that had become a nationwide symbol of wasteful earmark spending. She has publicly challenged Sen. Ted Stevens to come clean in the federal investigation into his financial dealings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics as usual? This is a far cry from the cozy relationship both Barack Obama and his own vice presidential choice, Joe Biden, have enjoyed with convicted Chicago political fundraiser Antoin &quot;Tony&quot; Rezko, whose help Sen. Obama accepted in financing the young senator's million-dollar mansion in what the Democratic nominee now admits was &quot;a mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modern Americans rarely elect big-city taxoholic Eastern liberals to the White House, as Michael Dukakis and John Kerry can testify. Instead, they generally elect &quot;outsiders,&quot; relatively conservative governors from the West and South, as both fans and foes of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush may recall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin fits that bill. She's a mother of five and wife of an oil field worker, a woman who - married to a Yup'ik Eskimo - lives racial equality in her own home, a woman who has challenged a corrupt political establishment at every step in her career and who believes what Americans need is not bigger, more intrusive, pork-laden government but rather to be allowed to keep more of what they earn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin is not a lawyer or urban ward-heeler or career Washington insider but an articulate, independent Westerner who has been elevated by Alaskan voters in a fairy-tale succession of victories as their anti-corruption underdog, a woman who has worked on a commercial fishing boat and hunted moose in the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Palin selection was a surprise and carries an element of risk. But the Alaska governor appears to be an eminently promising and principled up-and-comer who can truly claim the mantle of &quot;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have preached from this bully pulpit for years that the best response to free speech you hate is more free speech - back and forth, to and fro until truth emerges victorious on the honorable field of bloodless verbal battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that seldom seems to be the way it works out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nay, the knives come out and demands for revenge escalate, from cries for apology or demotion or firing to threats of boycott to beheading to casting into the auto-de-f&eacute; for having the audacity to speak heresy of the Gospel According to Barack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such behavior was on full-throated display after Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois picked Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware to be his running mate in his bid for the presidency, and The Associated Press Washington Bureau Chief Ron Fournier penned an &quot;analysis&quot; piece for the wire service saying, &quot;The candidate of change went with the status quo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end, the article mentioned a 2007 ABC interview in which Biden said Obama was not ready to serve as president. The last line stated, &quot;It seems Obama is worried that some voters are starting to agree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fournier's penchant for adding an ample dose of how and why to the standard who, what and when prompted much hand-wringing and navel-gazing when he was appointed to head the bureau in May. Fournier calls it accountability journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Write with authority,&quot; he wrote in a memo to AP staffers a year before his promotion. &quot;The AP's hard-earned reputation for fairness and nonpartisanship must not be used as an excuse for fuzzy language when a clear voice is demanded, nor should it force us to give both sides of a story equal play when one side is plainly wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem many journalists have with that is: Whose role is it to decide which side is plainly wrong? (That's why I'm not a big fan of &quot;analysis&quot; pieces among the news columns, though they can have a role if written with even-handedness and clearly labeled as such.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 18 people in the Review-Journal's circulation area - I hesitate to call them all readers - had no such compunctions and e-mailed the paper in high dudgeon, voicing various demands as to what to do about Mr. Fournier and The AP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They called him biased, a propagandizer and a beta weasel. They compared him to Fox News, said he was in contact with Karl Rove, and said he consistently smears Democrats and favors the GOP's Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One lady wrote: &quot;Fournier needs to go. NOW. ... I'm tired of having my constitutional rights trampled on. It's MY constitution and MY country and I want it back. Fournier does absolutely NOTHING to further those goals in any way, shape or form. I hope he's investigated for propagandizing the media too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was one minor problem with this wailing to the Review-Journal. We never published the piece in question. It appears all or most of the missives were generated from a MoveOn.org Web site that listed talking points and encouraged viewers to type their ZIP codes into a box that then linked to e-mail addresses of newspapers in their area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I replied to all asking whether they'd actually read the Fournier article, but only a handful said they had, possibly after I'd asked. Few grasped the apparently slippery concept that differentiates straight news from analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next, there's the case of the television commercial produced by an independent organization that spells out the longtime ties Obama has to unrepentant domestic terrorist William Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after it aired, the Obama campaign answered with a rebuttal denying any ties to Ayers, trying to blame McCain for the ad and protesting that it brings up crimes committed by Ayers - a dozen bombings in early 1970s that included a New York City police headquarters, the U.S. Capitol and the Pentagon - when Obama was 8 years old. If left at that, all well and good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no, the earth must be scorched. An Obama lawyer wrote to the TV stations airing the ads threatening them and suggesting their broadcast licenses could be in jeopardy for &quot;accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama supporters deluged the stations with 93,000 e-mails, many threatening boycotts of the stations and their advertisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama campaign lawyer wrote the Justice Department demanding an investigation of &quot;a knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law.&quot; Might that be the McCain-Feingold election law?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that weren't enough, a company that filmed a documentary on Ayers' Weather Underground is claiming copyright violations, saying the ad steals footage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have flung their sheaths away and their blades thirst for blood.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">D; Pg. 2D</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest concern about GOP Sen. John McCain choosing little-known Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential nominee should be obvious:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party has energized the political process over the past year by conducting a primary campaign primarily between a woman and a younger, dynamic African-American. Next to Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. McCain faces an uphill battle to shake the &quot;old fogey&quot; label. Under the circumstances, it doesn't take much cynicism to imagine the Arizona senator and his advisers believing they needed a woman or minority on the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the politics of groups and pigeonholes, and that's unfortunate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, elections are waged in the real world, and regardless of how Sen. McCain narrowed his choice to Gov. Palin, the question now is whether she is an honest and dynamic leader representing &quot;change&quot; from Washington's wasteful business as usual - and secondarily whether she can attract the necessary few extra votes in half a dozen &quot;swing&quot; states (including Nevada) to prevail in what shapes up to be another tight presidential contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Palin has as many years of public service as Sen. Obama (five more, actually), so that issue is a wash - except that the Democrats have chosen to put their relative newcomer at the top of the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a glance at Gov. Palin's political resume and personal history should prove heartening to voters who really seek &quot;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A life member of the National Rifle Association, Sarah Palin would sometimes rise at 3 a.m. to hunt moose with her father before school. She was point guard and captain of her high school's 1982 state championship basketball team and the 1984 runner-up in the Miss Alaska pageant, receiving a scholarship that allowed her to attend the University of Idaho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After working as a sports reporter at an Anchorage television station, Ms. Palin served two terms on the Wasilla, Alaska, City Council from 1992 to 1996, when she challenged the incumbent mayor, criticizing wasteful spending and high taxes. Winning that election, she kept her campaign promises, cutting her own salary and reducing property taxes by 60 percent. She was elected president of the Alaska Conference of Mayors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appointed Ethics Commissioner of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, she resigned in 2004 in protest over what she called the &quot;lack of ethics&quot; of fellow Alaskan Republican leaders, who ignored her whistle-blowing complaints. After she resigned, she exposed the state Republican Party's chairman for doing work for the party on public time. He resigned and paid a record fine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin ran a clean-up-government campaign for governor in 2006, charging ethical violations by state Republican Party leaders. She upset then-Gov. Frank Murkowski in the Republican gubernatorial primary and then - despite a lack of support from party leaders and a far smaller war chest than her opponent - went on to win the general election, defeating former Gov. Tony Knowles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Palin successfully killed the &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; that had become a nationwide symbol of wasteful earmark spending. She has publicly challenged Sen. Ted Stevens to come clean in the federal investigation into his financial dealings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics as usual? This is a far cry from the cozy relationship both Barack Obama and his own vice presidential choice, Joe Biden, have enjoyed with convicted Chicago political fundraiser Antoin &quot;Tony&quot; Rezko, whose help Sen. Obama accepted in financing the young senator's million-dollar mansion in what the Democratic nominee now admits was &quot;a mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modern Americans rarely elect big-city taxoholic Eastern liberals to the White House, as Michael Dukakis and John Kerry can testify. Instead, they generally elect &quot;outsiders,&quot; relatively conservative governors from the West and South, as both fans and foes of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush may recall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin fits that bill. She's a mother of five and wife of an oil field worker, a woman who - married to a Yup'ik Eskimo - lives racial equality in her own home, a woman who has challenged a corrupt political establishment at every step in her career and who believes what Americans need is not bigger, more intrusive, pork-laden government but rather to be allowed to keep more of what they earn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin is not a lawyer or urban ward-heeler or career Washington insider but an articulate, independent Westerner who has been elevated by Alaskan voters in a fairy-tale succession of victories as their anti-corruption underdog, a woman who has worked on a commercial fishing boat and hunted moose in the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Palin selection was a surprise and carries an element of risk. But the Alaska governor appears to be an eminently promising and principled up-and-comer who can truly claim the mantle of &quot;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">HENDERSON Nev.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potential vice presidential nominee Mitt Romney accused Democrats on Wednesday of playing &quot;the politics of envy&quot; in recent ads and speeches that focus on John McCain's wealth and multiple homes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate defended his former rival for the Republican nomination against the full-on Democratic assault, saying presidential candidate Barack Obama was resorting to divisive politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand the Democrats are trying to use the politics of envy and I don't think that works,&quot; Romney told The Associated Press before campaigning on McCain's behalf near Las Vegas. Asked to explain, he said he saw the criticism as &quot;the politics of jealousy or envy or a sense that somehow we're going to be less likely to vote for someone because they've achieved economic success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has been the subject of mockery and negative television commercials since he told a reporter last week that he did not know how many homes he owned and needed to check with his staff. Obama's campaign is running a commercial describing the Arizona senator as out of touch. Democrats meeting at their national convention in Denver have rarely missed an opportunity to get in digs from the podium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, whose own wealth is estimated at up to $250 million, noted that past Democratic presidents including Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy connected with voters despite their ballooning bank accounts. He said McCain's personal history allows him to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think growing up as a military brat, traveling around as a soldier and even being homeless for five years, in a prison, the notion that he is somehow above the American people is going to fall flat. Voters recognize a man who is very much in touch with American values, American citizens,&quot; Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is precisely the point Democrats are trying to challenge and hope might have particular potency to voters battered by the rough economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the problem: John McCain is out of touch with Americans who are struggling to keep their homes and worried about paying their bills,&quot; Obama spokeswoman Kirsten Searer responded. &quot;John McCain is so out of touch, he thinks the economy is strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney is on a short list of potential running mates for McCain. Many in the West believe as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints he could help McCain tap into vital networks of Mormon voters and drive up turnout in key battlegrounds such as Colorado and Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's appeal was on full display Wednesday. His appearance drew nearly 1,000 people to a convention center in southern Nevada's suburbs, the bedrock of his support in the state. The crowd carried no McCain signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt's a fit,&quot; one man yelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Jon Porter, R-Nev., asked the crowd to cheer for &quot;Romney-McCain,&quot; before catching himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney aimed his remarks at Obama, describing the 47-year-old Illinois senator as a &quot;charming, attractive young fellow&quot; with too little experience to lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would not discuss his status as a potential running mate, but came prepared for another question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney said he has four homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One less than John Kerry,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Derek Washington almost didn't make it here for the Democratic National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had given up,&quot; said the passionate Hillary Clinton supporter, elected at the Nevada Democratic convention in May as an alternate. &quot;A week ago, I did not have one dime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, 45, is HIV-positive and lives on disability payments in Las Vegas. But a couple of weeks ago, he got a call from the Clinton campaign asking him to be a delegate whip at this week's convention, where he'll keep track of Clinton delegates on the floor and minimize disruptions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've never wanted anything so bad as to be here to support Hillary Clinton,&quot; he said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, a former television producer with a big personality, sent a mass e-mail to all his contacts from the Nevada caucuses, when he and they poured their hearts into the cause. They forwarded the message to their friends. Washington heard from strangers all over the country, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton aides contacted Washington and told him his message made it all the way to Clinton herself. Small donations poured in: nearly $800 in cash, restaurant gift certificates to keep him fed, a free plane ticket from a friend's frequent-flier miles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the most amazing experience,&quot; he said. &quot;It shows people are nice, and if you never give up, you can do anything you want to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington's story epitomizes the ebullient, dream-come-true mood of the Democrats who are here this week. Many of them, like him, are first-time participants in party politics who made it on a wing and a prayer. Washington said he has always voted, but he has never been involved in party politics to this degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he's also part of the story Democrats don't want this week to be about: the lingering loyalty to Clinton that they wish they could push from the spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans were trying to highlight the Democrats' divisions as the convention opened, with Republican John McCain's campaign airing a new ad featuring a former Clinton delegate expressing support for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, who is black, has heard it all from those who support Barack Obama, who will leave this convention as the Democrats' nominee. Washington has been called &quot;race traitor&quot; and worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to him, Hillary Clinton is a savior. Diagnosed with HIV about a year ago, he spent months on his mother's couch in Las Vegas, able to get up and change the channel on the television only rarely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From cooking shows, he learned to make fried macaroni and cheese wrapped in bacon. From the History Channel, he learned the names of every member of Hitler's command. And from the news channels, he became a political junkie and a huge fan of Clinton, especially her advocacy for health-care reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Clinton has dedicated her entire life to being of service to the American people,&quot; he wrote in his e-mail pitch for donations. &quot;Some people look at that as the same-old, same-old. I look at her service as the height of what it means to be an American. She embodied to me what an American can and should be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dragged himself off the couch and took a bus to participate in the Jan. 19 caucuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Washington feels the frustration of the Clinton supporters in Nevada. They are hurt and angry at being told to get over it, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These women know when they've been insulted, it's that simple,&quot; he said. &quot;This is going to be a big problem in November. The party is divided, divided, divided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton is scheduled to speak tonight at the convention. Her people are working with Obama's to find a way for her supporters to have a symbolic say in the process without exacerbating or showcasing divisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clark County Commissioner Rory Reid, Clinton's Nevada campaign chairman and a convention delegate, said Monday that whatever is worked out will be done &quot;in such a way that it brings the party together to win in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The talk of division, he said, is coming mainly from those outside the party who want Democrats to fail. &quot;Most people believe this country needs a change, and Barack Obama is going to make it happen,&quot; Reid said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington is supposed to be trained today in his job corralling Clinton delegates. He will try to gently dissuade those who might want to hold up a &quot;Nobama&quot; sign in front of TV cameras, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that doesn't mean he's totally on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mood here in Denver is infectious,&quot; he said. &quot;The pro-Obama mood is infectious. But without bitterness or rancor or any of that, he doesn't inspire me. He inspires a lot of people, but maybe I'm too old and too cynical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What he and his fellow loyalists want, he said, is to honor Clinton. &quot;We don't want to embarrass ourselves,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't want to reflect badly on Hillary Clinton - that's the important thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's staffers have told him he might get to meet her .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he does, what will he tell her?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said somberly. &quot;Thank you for saving my life. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of you.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers weren't too different when only Clark County residents were asked. Again, 23 percent said Yucca would be a major influence; 41 percent said it would have no influence; and 34 percent said it would have some influence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously it's going to affect different voters in different ways,&quot; said Brad Coker, managing partner of the independent firm that conducted the telephone survey for the Review-Journal, Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research Inc., based in Washington, D.C. &quot;If you look at who it will have a major impact on, it is primarily Democratic voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coker's comments came Thursday, the day that Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign launched its second television ad on the Yucca issue. The new ad takes a jab at his Republican opponent: &quot;If you don't want nuclear waste here, you don't want John McCain here,&quot; referring to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who historically has been a strong supporter of the Yucca Mountain Project, has added a recent caveat to his stance, saying in order for the project to go forward it must meet all safety and environmental standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 36 percent of the Democrat respondents said Yucca Mountain would have a major influence on their choice for president. The statewide results have a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. The Clark County results have a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 8 percent of the Republican respondents said entombing the nation's highly radioactive waste in Yucca Mountain, 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, would have a major impact on their vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a similar poll in June, 45 percent of Nevada respondents said Yucca Mountain would have no influence on their vote for president; 14 percent said it would have a major impact; and 38 percent said the nuclear waste project would have some influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a related question, one about positions on storing nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain, most Nevadans - 58 percent - opposed the government's disposal plans, mirroring the 58 percent in June who said they want to fight the Yucca Mountain Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's roughly the same result as four years ago when a Mason-Dixon poll for the Review-Journal found that 55 percent of Nevadans want to fight Yucca Mountain, while 38 percent favored making a deal for benefits to let it go forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this month's regional poll, 51 percent of the respondents from Utah opposed storing nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain, but only 20 percent from Arizona opposed the plan. Fifty-five percent of the Arizona respondents support the Yucca Mountain Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don Ashley, who has lived in Las Vegas for 71 years, was among the 38 percent of the respondents who said the Yucca Mountain issue wouldn't influence whom he wants in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't mind if they open Yucca Mountain up for a dump,&quot; Ashley said. &quot;Somebody's got to store it, and the government would pay us lots of money for it. I think it's time for people to realize that we're going to get it sooner or later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carole Manshreck moved to Las Vegas 20 years ago from Chicago. As a respondent in the poll, she said Yucca Mountain would have some influence on whom she votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want it here,&quot; she said about spent nuclear fuel. &quot;It's better off staying right where it is than moving it. Why would you move something that's so toxic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain doesn't want it in his backyard,&quot; Manshreck said of the Arizona senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coker said the Yucca Mountain issue might make a difference in whom independent voters choose for president. About 26 percent of them are undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the poll, more than two-thirds of the independents - 69 percent - indicated Yucca Mountain would influence their decision on the next president. In all, 23 percent of the independents said Yucca Mountain would make a major influence on their vote, and 46 percent said it would have some influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a related nuclear power issue in Western states, 58 percent of those polled in Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming supported increased uranium mining to expand nuclear power. Two-thirds of Wyoming respondents, 66 percent, supported increased uranium mining. In Nevada, 58 percent, supported it and 29 percent opposed it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You had three agendas last week at the Saddleback Church forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Warren, the casual preacher, was trying to establish himself as the modernized Falwell, more willing than his evangelically political ancestors to exhibit kindness toward Democrats and political inclusiveness in his purpose-driven theology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama was trying to put on display his new kind of politics of bipartisan hope, one that blends elements of secularism, liberalism and moderate religion with something different from a left-tending Democrat - a courteous, respectful and solicitous nod to those of more strident moral views. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, disdainful of religious conservatives a year or two before, wanted to try to preserve the old polarized Republican evangelical base and pander to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warren and McCain succeeded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preacher presented questions based in religious fundamentalism, but he dressed them up with a smile, even maybe a bit of a wink toward Obama, almost as if to signal to the Democratic candidate that, truth be known, he could go along with some of that moderation and nuance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain came armed with the same superficial bombast that gave us what we've had the past eight years. When does life begin? Conception, he said simply. What to do about gasoline prices? Drill now, he said simply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama fell into that trap by which Republicans and the evangelicals and fundamentalists have caught so many Democrats over the years. It's the trap of trying to finesse in the face of the opposition's simplistic bombast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The finesse inevitably comes across as slick, evasive, professorial, defensive, deflective, less than honest, not genuine. Bombast, by contrast, looks brave and true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time and again Obama took Warren's queries and turned them into thoughtfully ambivalent lectures in which he attempted to explain that he shared the audience members' spiritual and moral values, but not necessarily their political confidence in the pragmatic application of those values to workable policy in this complex, pluralistic nation and world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end his best effort at presenting a new and more obliging Democratic politics came off as, well, recycled Clintonism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When one guy is giving simple, straight answers, confident that he is galvanizing one polarized faction and satisfied that he has no prayer with the other polarized faction, and when the other guy is trying to hold one polarized faction at bay while he tries to make nice with the other polarized faction, then the smart money should be put on the man with the simple, straight answers who is willing to take a side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic finesse is fraught with peril. When does life begin? Obama said that was above his pay grade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, dear. Simple questions of right-and-wrong should never be dismissed as above a presidential candidate's pay grade. For that matter, there's not much that an applicant for president of the United States can successfully dismiss as above his pay grade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I see an attack ad in mid-October. Dare you vote for the guy who says moral questions are above his pay grade?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama would have been better off answering simply that life begins at conception or actual birth - either one - then adapting that answer to the political, legal and social realities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He could then have gone on the offensive. He could have said that Roe v. Wade is the law, that repealing it would still allow states to allow abortion and that abortion opponents ought to be figuring out by now that the bombastic and superficial pandering to them by the Bushes and McCains hadn't accomplished what he intended to accomplish, which was reducing abortion in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said some of that, actually, but it got lost in the tired finesse and the pay-grade gaffe.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago as Nevada Democrats prepared to attend their party's national convention in Boston, they had been hammered with the message that they lived in a battleground state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nominee and his vice presidential pick had been off touring the country for weeks. At every stage in the nomination process, Nevada Democrats turned out in record numbers and believed in their hearts that 2004 was their year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, as the Nevada delegation trickles into Denver, the effort to turn the state blue is becoming, slowly, a burden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats are trouncing Republicans in the ground game - contacting voters and registering new ones. The state has been reliably blue all year in terms of voter registration and now the Democrats hold a 60,000-vote lead. Given that Republicans carried Nevada in the past two presidential elections by a total of just 21,000 votes, the conventional wisdom would have it that Democrats are the ones to beat here provided those new voters turn out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week when asked to make a November prediction, Harry Reid said he was &quot;confident&quot; Nevada will &quot;do the right thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not exactly a &quot;we're going to turn Nevada blue.&quot; And since the Senate majority leader was dead on in his zealous prediction of caucus turnout early this year, party faithful are looking to him for clues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Reid's being more practical, relying on polls and the realization that this year, 2008, is going to be a drag-out battle for the Battle Born state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poll published in today's Review-Journal shows Republican McCain leading Democrat Obama in Nevada, 46-39, exceeding the poll's 5-point margin of error. But a recent poll by the Reno Gazette-Journal put the race between Obama and Republican John McCain at a statistical tie. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reno and surrounding Washoe County have gone blue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama still has trouble with the distaff part of his base, and independent voters have been getting a steady diet this month of claims that Obama is a celebrity who will raise your taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They may like celebrities in Elko, but they sure don't dig taxes - even if the vast majority of voters would not pay more under an Obama administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party is so disorganized it couldn't even properly select its delegates to the national convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the GOP typically gets its act together about 72 hours prior to Election Day, all the while hammering the Democratic nominee as an out-of-touch liberal who will raise your taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, with their crotchety old nominee, Republicans are sure to also hit hard on Obama's limited experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is against this backdrop that Democrats return to Denver, 100 years since the city first welcomed them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Nevada delegation will come to Colorado split about 60-40 between Obama supporters and those who caucused for Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's most vocal reps during the caucus process are also elected leaders representing many of the older female and working-class, white Democrats who remain peeved about the primary process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County Commissioners Chris Giunchigliani and Rory Reid will come to Denver pledged to Clinton, but after the symbolic roll call vote, they will certainly work to nominate Obama in another symbolic vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the national conventions are all about symbolism, this year both nominees will attempt to actually make the meetings translate into real time campaign help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, John Kerry's slight bump in the polls after Boston was eradicated by the time the GOP finished four nights of flip-flop talk in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the nation has a reason to really tune in to both conventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's decision to announce his vice presidential pick just before the convention will lead many to tune in just to see what the prospective veep will say and do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, fearing another electric speech by Obama, will move to deaden any bounce the Democrats get out of Denver by announcing his vice presidential pick the day after Obama accepts the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hopes to control the news cycle moving to St. Paul, and to keep it focused on his criticism of Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Nevadans, the conventions also hold the Yucca card. In Boston four years ago it was Republican Sen. John Ensign who dominated the news by trying to float a line that Kerry was soft on Yucca Mountain opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensign and the Republicans waited for the second day of the convention to unveil an old letter Kerry had signed to keep the waste out of Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If past is prologue, you can bet the GOP will try to move news coverage from Denver to hit Obama as soft on Yucca.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is already on the air here with his second Yucca specific ad. That may be enough to get his message out first. And after all, McCain not only has a record of supporting Yucca, he still advocates it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, I wouldn't be surprised if the Yucca card gets twisted in Denver with Republicans trotting out Obama's past financial contributions from Yucca-proponents in the energy field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real key for Democrats in Denver is trying to get out front with Obama's economic message in a way that plays differently than the attacks from the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the real magic will be if voters actually hear them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama began airing a new television ad in Las Vegas on Thursday that criticizes Republican John McCain for supporting the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, &quot;Dangerous,&quot; states, &quot;If you don't want nuclear waste here, you don't want John McCain here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the second Nevada-specific ad the Obama campaign has aired on the Yucca issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ad features local residents expressing fears about radioactive waste being shipped to the site, 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, &quot;passing through city after city and town after town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He cares about his state; he really doesn't care about Nevada,&quot; resident Cathy Kama says in the ad. The narrator states, &quot;John McCain says he's opposed to nuclear waste going through Arizona. But he wants to dump it here, in Nevada.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That claim is taken from a May 2007 interview on the Reno news discussion program &quot;Nevada Newsmakers,&quot; in which the Arizona senator was asked if he would be comfortable with nuclear waste being trucked through Phoenix and answered, &quot;No, I would not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A previous Obama campaign ad featured a clip from the interview, provoking an objection from the show's host, Sam Shad, who said the comment was taken out of context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interview, McCain went on to say that nuclear waste transport would have to be made safer and that the waste's current situation, in pools and ponds on nuclear plant sites around the country, was far more of a risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Rick Gorka said Thursday that the ad was based on a &quot;widely discredited&quot; premise. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain's point was it has to be done safely,&quot; he said. &quot;He doesn't want to truck it through any state if it's unsafe. That's irresponsible, whether it's Phoenix or Las Vegas. It has to be done with all the concerns addressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If elected, Obama has vowed to stop the repository, which polls show is opposed by most Nevada residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, a longtime supporter of the project, has seemed to soften his stance while campaigning here, saying he'd make sure the repository met environmental and safety standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The choice this presidential election could not be more clear,&quot; Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., said during a conference call with reporters Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain has been a leading proponent in favor of storage of nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain his entire career. He speaks about it, he brags about it, he wants it, no bones about it. Senator Obama has stated, inside the state of Nevada and outside the state of Nevada, if he is elected, this project is dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada twice threw its electoral votes to President Bush, who has pushed Yucca Mountain forward during his years in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why the Obama campaign thinks the issue could be a winning one despite that history, Berkley said Nevadans were fooled by Bush's mantra of &quot;sound science&quot; but are determined not to be fooled again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This time, Nevadans know better,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berkley also accused the McCain campaign of using coded racial references to smear Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I hear the word 'elitist,' to me that is a code word for 'uppity,' and I find it extremely offensive,&quot; Berkley said. &quot;John McCain should know better. ... That's a code word for 'uppity black man,' and that's beneath the dignity of every American.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Nevada congresswoman and surrogate for Barack Obama accused John McCain's campaign on Thursday of using veiled language to paint the Democratic presidential candidate as an &quot;uppity black man.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a conference call with reporters, U.S. Rep. Shelley Berkley of Las Vegas said the Republican's attempts to portray his rival as out of touch with average Americans carried racial undertones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I hear the word 'elitist' linked with Barack Obama, to me, that is a code word for 'uppity,'&quot; Berkley said on a call organized by the Obama campaign to announce a new television ad. &quot;I find it extremely offensive, and John McCain should know better. And until this election, he handled himself in a far more enlightened way. ... They're not using the word 'elitist' by accident, that's a code word for 'uppity black man.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berkley's analysis was not echoed by Obama's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is not a characterization the campaign agrees with,&quot; said Obama spokeswoman Kirsten Searer. &quot;That is our only comment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berkley's comments interjected the issue of race on a day the two presidential candidates, both millionaires, traded accusations of elitism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While campaigning in Virginia, Obama pounced on the Arizona senator's admission that he did not know how many homes he owned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign tried to deflect attention from the gaffe by issuing a statement noting that the Illinois senator sought advice from Chicago businessman Tony Rezko when he bought his home in Chicago for $1.65 million in 2005. Rezko has since been convicted on corruption charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berkley, a popular five-term lawmaker, was asked on the conference call to discuss an unrelated new campaign commercial. The ad, called &quot;Dangerous,&quot; is the second attacking McCain for supporting the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama met Sunday with Texas oil baron and longtime conservative activist T. Boone Pickens to discuss strategies for developing alternative energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential hopeful praised Pickens as a &quot;legendary entrepreneur&quot; and deflected a question about the billionaire's role in helping to fund a television ad campaign that undermined John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, he's got a longer track record than that,&quot; Obama told reporters when asked about Pickens' association with the ads by a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. &quot;One of the things I think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy. ... That's what we're going to be talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 2004 presidential campaign, Pickens spent $3 million to help bankroll the Swift Boat organization, a group tied to supporters of President Bush that ran television ads questioning Kerry's record as a swift boat commander during the Vietnam War. The ads were believed to have damaged Kerry in several battleground states, contributing to his narrow loss to Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Pickens is bankrolling a much different kind of campaign. A critic of U.S. dependence on oil and a champion of wind power and other alternative energy forms, he has vowed to spend $58 million to promote his &quot;Pickens Plan,&quot; which calls for the U.S. to generate 22 percent of its electricity through wind and other sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high cost of energy has emerged as a central campaign issue between Obama and his Republican rival John McCain. Pickens met with McCain in Colorado last week to discuss his plan and requested a similar meeting with Obama. The two men talked privately for about 45 minutes, campaign officials said Sunday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The host of a Northern Nevada news discussion television program has asked the presidential campaign of Democrat Barack Obama to take down a commercial that uses footage from his show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sam Shad, host of &quot;Nevada Newsmakers,&quot; interviewed Obama's Republican opponent, John McCain, in May 2007. A short clip from that interview is featured in a new Obama campaign ad that takes McCain to task for his support of the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign maintains that permission was not necessary to use the eight seconds of footage that are featured in the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to Shad on Tuesday, lawyers for the campaign said federal law &quot;provides broad protection for the use of copyrighted work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shad said he objects to having footage from his show used for political purposes, an objection other campaigns have honored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the primary campaign two years ago, he said, the campaign of Brian Krolicki, then the state treasurer and a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, used a clip from the show in a commercial critical of another Republican candidate, Barbara Lee Woollen. Shad asked Krolicki's campaign to pull the ad, and it complied, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My request is not political or partisan in nature, I would request the same of the McCain campaign or anyone else who attempted this,&quot; Shad wrote in an e-mail to the Obama campaign lawyers Tuesday . He added, &quot;Your client did not seek permission to use this and it would not have been granted if they did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the copyright law doctrine of &quot;fair use,&quot; a small amount of copyrighted material may be excerpted without permission for certain non-commercial purposes, such as when the text of a book is quoted in a book review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shad said he did not think the campaign ad met that standard because it was a paid advertisement, not a political commentary. He said Tuesday he was awaiting a further response from the campaign but would consider other options, including legal challenges .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, Kirsten Searer, said the ad, which began airing Monday statewide, would not be pulled or altered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clip featured in the ad shows Shad asking McCain, &quot;Would you be comfortable with nuclear waste coming through Arizona on its way, you know, going through Phoenix, on its way to Yucca Mountain?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain answers, &quot;No, I would not,&quot; and the commercial cuts off the rest .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not worried about nuclear waste in our state - only in Arizona,&quot; a narrator says in the ad, titled &quot;Backyard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the original interview, McCain went on to say, &quot;I think it can be made safe, and ... what people forget is the (other) option of leaving this waste in areas outside, maybe unprotected or certainly not well-protected, all over America rather than having it in a safe and secure repository for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a national veterans' convention in Las Vegas on Saturday, Republican presidential candidate John McCain criticized his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, for not supporting last year's temporary buildup in troop levels in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the Middle East could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines,&quot; McCain told about 3,500 fellow members of the Disabled American Veterans at Bally's Las Vegas. &quot;This is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent, Senator Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who has advocated setting deadlines for bringing home American troops, opposed the so-called troop surge when it was proposed, predicting that it would not have the desired effect of quelling violence in Iraq. McCain supported it despite its unpopularity at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a clarifying moment,&quot; said McCain, a Navy veteran and former prisoner of war. &quot;It was a moment when political self-interest and the national interest parted ways.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The troop increase has been credited with reduced levels of bloodshed, but Obama has since said a combination of factors, not just the surge, were responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama still can't quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment,&quot; McCain charged, adding that the episode showed Obama lacked &quot;the judgment to be commander in chief.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain devoted the bulk of his speech at the disabled veterans' annual convention to outlining proposals for reforming veterans' health care. Though McCain said he wouldn't be signing the group's &quot;Stand Up for Veterans&quot; pledge, he said, &quot;I give you my word that as president I will see that these obligations are kept.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scandal that revealed shocking lapses in outpatient care at Washington, D.C.'s Walter Reed Army Medical Center was &quot;a disgrace unworthy of this nation,&quot; McCain said. &quot;Americans who fought to defend this nation should always rank among the highest of national priorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said he would &quot;make sure that Congress funds the VA health care budget in a sufficient, timely and predictable manner.&quot; Those are buzzwords for the veterans, who blame problems with VA funding and services on the fact that its budget comes from discretionary rather than mandatory federal funds. As a result, the agency's funding is often late and subjected to political pressures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said that although he supported adequate VA funding, it must not be burdened by wasteful earmarks .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also called for creation of a &quot;Veterans' Care Access Card,&quot; which he said would allow vets to get health care outside VA facilities if time, distance or availability of specialists made it difficult to access the VA system. The idea of such a card is opposed by the veterans group, which does not want veterans' care in the hands of private companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This card is not intended to either replace the VA or privatize veterans' health care, as some have wrongly charged,&quot; McCain said in his speech. &quot;I believe the VA should always be there to provide top-quality care for our veterans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain further advocated reforming the system to improve treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, and to increase services available to growing numbers of female veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Democratic disabled veteran who responded to McCain's speech on behalf of Obama's campaign criticized McCain for his support of the health care card idea, saying vets want to be treated by the VA, with their &quot;buddies,&quot; and what's needed is VA expansion rather than alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois former congressional candidate who lost both legs in Iraq, also criticized McCain for not supporting the &quot;New G.I. Bill,&quot; an expansion of veterans' education benefits that became law earlier this year. Obama supported the legislation, while McCain, who had opposed it, was not present for the vote in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the time came to cast a vote on the most important piece of legislation to improve benefits for veterans, Senator Obama was there for us,&quot; Duckworth said. &quot;Senator McCain did not show up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duckworth, now director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs, was honored as the Disabled Veteran of the Year at the convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, vacationing with his family in Hawaii, addressed the convention Saturday morning in a videotaped speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has gotten low marks from the disabled veterans group in the past, earning the lowest grade in the Senate in the group's 2006 rankings, a 20 percent score. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grade was largely because of McCain's votes against bills that included VA funding because of his opposition to wasteful spending. Obama got an 80 percent score .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Violante, the organization's legislative director, said it has good working relationships with both presidential candidates in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is a fiscal conservative,&quot; he said of McCain. &quot;The biggest problems we've had with him have been issues about increased funding for the VA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obama&nbsp;ad hits mccain for yucca support</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Saturday unveiled a television ad specific to Nevada that criticizes his opponent, Republican John McCain, for supporting the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second commercial features footage of McCain telling a Reno interviewer last year that he wouldn't be comfortable with nuclear waste being transported through Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not worried about nuclear waste in our state - only in Arizona,&quot; the narrator says in the ad, entitled &quot;Backyard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama opposes opening Yucca, the ad says. &quot;He'll protect our families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, which Obama's campaign said would begin airing statewide on Monday, marks the first state-specific salvo of the general election. Nevada is considered a key swing state for both campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has long openly supported the nuclear facility 100 miles outside Las Vegas and has called for swift and dramatic expansion of nuclear power. He also has noted that Yucca Mountain should be approved only when it can meet all environmental requirements. And the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, as is now done in France, must be part of the equation, he has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though most Nevadans say they oppose the repository, it's unclear to what extent they base their presidential votes on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clip featured in the new ad shows Sam Shad, host of the Reno news discussion program &quot;Nevada Newsmakers,&quot; asking McCain, &quot;Would you be comfortable with nuclear waste coming through Arizona on its way, you know, going through Phoenix, on its way to Yucca Mountain?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain answers, &quot;No, I would not,&quot; and the commercial cuts off the rest of the exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in the original interview, McCain went on to say, &quot;I think it can be made safe, and ... what people forget is the (other) option of leaving this waste in areas outside, maybe unprotected or certainly not well protected, all over America rather than having it in a safe and secure repository for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radioactive waste's current storage on-site at nuclear generating plants is ripe for terrorist attacks, McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the ad, the Republican National Committee attempted to accuse Obama of having voted for funding for Yucca Mountain, referring to his votes in favor of massive energy funding bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bills in question were supported by the Nevada delegation, which is unanimously opposed to the project, and weren't considered Yucca Mountain votes by Yucca opponents. Funding for Yucca in the bills had been reduced from original levels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second commercial features footage of McCain telling a Reno interviewer last year that he wouldn't be comfortable with nuclear waste being transported through Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not worried about nuclear waste in our state - only in Arizona,&quot; the narrator says in the ad, entitled &quot;Backyard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama opposes opening Yucca, the ad says. &quot;He'll protect our families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, which Obama's campaign said would begin airing statewide on Monday, marks the first state-specific salvo of the general election. Nevada is considered a key swing state for both campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has long openly supported the nuclear facility 100 miles outside Las Vegas and has called for swift and dramatic expansion of nuclear power. He also has noted that Yucca Mountain should be approved only when it can meet all environmental requirements. And the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, as is now done in France, must be part of the equation, he has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though most Nevadans say they oppose the repository, it's unclear to what extent they base their presidential votes on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clip featured in the new ad shows Sam Shad, host of the Reno news discussion program &quot;Nevada Newsmakers,&quot; asking McCain, &quot;Would you be comfortable with nuclear waste coming through Arizona on its way, you know, going through Phoenix, on its way to Yucca Mountain?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain answers, &quot;No, I would not,&quot; and the commercial cuts off the rest of the exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in the original interview, McCain went on to say, &quot;I think it can be made safe, and ... what people forget is the (other) option of leaving this waste in areas outside, maybe unprotected or certainly not well protected, all over America rather than having it in a safe and secure repository for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radioactive waste's current storage on-site at nuclear generating plants is ripe for terrorist attacks, McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the ad, the Republican National Committee attempted to accuse Obama of having voted for funding for Yucca Mountain, referring to his votes in favor of massive energy funding bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bills in question were supported by the Nevada delegation, which is unanimously opposed to the project, and weren't considered Yucca Mountain votes by Yucca opponents. Funding for Yucca in the bills had been reduced from original levels.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if no new reactors are built, getting rid of the country's nuclear waste will cost $96.2 billion and require a major expansion of the planned Nevada waste dump beyond limits imposed by Congress, the Energy Department said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revised cost estimate for the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas came as the presumed Republican presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain, renewed his call for building as many as 45 new power reactors by 2030. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such an expansion would require a waste disposal program well beyond what is envisioned by the current Yucca Mountain project, which itself has been highly controversial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is a strong supporter of the Yucca site, while his Democratic presidential rival, Sen. Barack Obama, has opposed it and believes other options should be examined. Obama also has shown little enthusiasm for new reactor construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government now says the Yucca Mountain project in Nevada will cost $38.7 billion more than was anticipated in 2001 when the Energy Department estimated the life cycle cost of the program at $57.5 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward Sproat, the Energy Department official in charge of the federal nuclear waste program, said $16 billion of that increase is pegged to inflation. The program also has become more expensive because Yucca will have to accept more waste than previously had been anticipated since current reactors are being allowed to operate longer, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sproat said the department had crunched no numbers on how much nuclear waste disposal would cost if there were a rush in reactor construction on the scale suggested by McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yucca cost estimates cover waste only from existing reactors as well as from the defense program. &quot;If there is a significant increase, a major nuclear renaissance with a large number of new plants, a second repository ... may be needed,&quot; said Sproat in a conference call with reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $96.2 billion in 2007 dollars not accounting for future inflation includes $13.5 billion already spent on the Yucca project, $54.8 billion for construction and operation over 150 years and closing costs anticipated in 2113. It assumes the site will begin accepting used reactor fuel in 2020 and continue accepting shipments for 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Energy Department earlier this year submitted an application for a Yucca Mountain permit to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with a decision expected in three to four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the cost report Tuesday assumes that Yucca Mountain will have to accommodate far more waste both commercial and defense than stipulated in the NRC application and by Congress, which has limited the repository to 77,000 tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sproat said the cost estimate assumes the repository will house as much as 122,000 tons of waste, of which 109,000 tons will be from the current fleet of commercial reactors. For that to happen, Congress will have to approve the expansion of the Yucca facility beyond 77,000 tons. Such an expansion would require additional storage tunnels, but no aboveground expansion, Sproat said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yucca project has been highly contentious from the start, with Nevada politicians vigorously opposing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site's future also may hinge on this November's presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has called the Yucca project a mistake and that other options should be considered, including temporary, interim storage of waste until a more permanent solution can be developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, McCain believes Yucca a deep underground repository not far from the Nevada Test Site where the country conducted nuclear explosions during the Cold War is a suitable location for the tons of used reactor fuel, some of which will remain highly radioactive for a million years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sproat acknowledged the cost of Yucca Mountain is significant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you have to say compared to what. ... The cost of doing nothing is a lot higher,&quot; Sproat said. He had no estimate of what it would cost to leave used waste at reactor sites or at interim storage facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually the material would have to be moved somewhere, he said. &quot;All you're doing is ... pushing the whole problem out into the future and significantly increasing the cost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial power reactors have about 64,000 tons of used reactor fuel at power plants in 33 states awaiting shipment to Yucca Mountain, with the amount growing at the rate of 2,000 tons a year, according to the industry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be at least two empty seats in Nevada's delegation to the Republican National Convention next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reps. Jon Porter and Dean Heller are passing up the formal nomination of John McCain for the presidency to remain at home and campaign to keep their seats in Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My first priority is the campaign,&quot; Porter said in an interview last week. Aide Matt Leffingwell added, &quot;In an election year like this, (the convention) is just not a productive use of time for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porter did not attend the 2004 national convention in New York but did go to Philadelphia for the 2000 event. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heller attended the 2004 political convention as a delegate and Nevada's secretary of state. But now, as a freshman House member, he plans to remain in his district for that week, spokesman Stewart Bybee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Green, a history professor at the College of Southern Nevada, said it was probably a smart move for both lawmakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I were in their positions, I would probably do what they are doing,&quot; Green said. &quot;They don't want to give up four days that could be spent pumping the hands of people who might vote for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a flip side, Green added. With a who's who of Republicans all gathered in St. Paul, Minn., people might wonder whether the Nevadans aren't important enough to be there. &quot;It could be a two-edged sword,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The convention is Sept. 1-4. Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., will be there as an enthusiastic participant, his spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has generally gone in the past and considers it an enjoyable event,&quot; Tory Mazzola said. As chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Ensign will be raising money and promoting the party's candidates below McCain on the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also planning to attend is Gov. Jim Gibbons, spokesman Ben Kieckhefer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbons was present at a Lake Tahoe fundraiser for McCain on the candidate's visit to Northern Nevada last week. According to the Wall Street Journal, McCain had kind words for Gibbons at the event, calling him &quot;our great governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Democrats in Nevada's congressional delegation, Rep. Shelley Berkley and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, plan to attend their party's convention in Denver at the end of this month. Members of Congress and other top elected Democrats are automatic convention delegates, or superdelegates, whereas elected Republicans are not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GIBBONS-BASHING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada Democrats have been convinced for a while now that Gibbons is superlatively bad. Now they're making the case to the public with a new Web site: www.AmericasWorstGovernor.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site, which went up last week, features a surfable timeline of Gibbons missteps and a compendium of memorable quotes complete with an animated Gibbons photo, all set to a jaunty, clarinet jazz track. Readers are invited to submit mock &quot;text messages&quot; and tips about Gibbons' whereabouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's had so many missteps that it's probably difficult even for him to keep track of them,&quot; Nevada Democratic Party Executive Director Travis Brock told reporters during a conference call announcing the site last week. &quot;We're not just talking about a couple of scandals. We're talking about fumble after fumble after fumble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brock said the site was aimed at branding Gibbons with the &quot;America's Worst&quot; label both in advance of his own prospective re-election bid in 2010 and with an eye toward the current election year, when Gibbons isn't running but other Republicans are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is the face of the Republican Party in Nevada,&quot; Brock said. &quot;It really ties all of those folks to him.&quot; However, as liberal blogger Hugh Jackson noted on his site, the Las Vegas Gleaner, the site doesn't mention other Republicans, just Gibbons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbons spokesman Ben Kieckhefer said it is Democrats who have failed to show leadership in state government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they think so poorly of him, why are they following him in lockstep when it comes to solving the worst budget crisis in the history of the state?&quot; he said. &quot;They've offered zero solutions. If he's the worst, what does that make them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National political expert Larry Sabato, author of a book on 20th century state governors, noted that the type of designation the Democrats would like to pin Gibbons with is purely subjective and that governors historically have been involved in plenty of bad behavior, some of it carrying jail time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gibbons is one of the least successful and most scandal-prone of the current crop of governors - easily in the bottom two or three,&quot; was Sabato's judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a banner week for snarky Democratic Web sites with a Nevada flavor. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee last week rolled out therealfreedomswatch.com, a site aimed at pinning the work of Freedom's Watch on its major benefactor, Las Vegas Sands Corp. Chairman Sheldon Adelson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site features a parody of the &quot;Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas&quot; sign, a casino-style marquee and a spinning roulette wheel, along with the slogan, &quot;Gambling Away Americas' (sic) Future,&quot; one of many problematic apostrophes in the site's difficult-to-read text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEY, BIG SPENDER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just two months into the general election, the two presidential campaigns have poured nearly $2 million into television ads in Nevada, according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Advertising Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign has spent more on ads in the Silver State, the analysis found, purchasing $1.1 million in television time compared with Obama's $630,000. The analysis covered the period from June 3, when the primaries ended, to July 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain went up on television in Nevada on June 7, while Obama didn't take to the airwaves until June 20. Nevada is one of 14 states where both candidates have aired ads, according to the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, the study found, television spending in the 2008 campaign already has exceeded $50 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee has boosted McCain with $3.6 million in spending, none of it in Nevada, while the Democratic National Committee hasn't aired any ads yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Obama campaign had spent more overall on ads, $27 million to McCain's $21 million, McCain was spending more in most of the states where both campaigns are on the air, while Obama was paying to air ads in several states where McCain isn't on TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top targets of campaign advertising by state were Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. By city, the Philadelphia media market got the most ad-blitzed. Las Vegas was the No. 9 market, with 2,390 total campaign spots, while Reno was No. 19 with 2,031.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MUCHO DINERO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you've heard that Nevada is a battleground state, you've probably also heard - several times - that the Hispanic vote is this campaign's coveted demographic in these parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee announced what they said was a &quot;bold and unprecedented&quot; plan to mobilize Latino voters, particularly in Nevada, Colorado, Florida and New Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $20 million initiative is &quot;of a size and scope that has never been undertaken in the history of presidential politics,&quot; said Frank Sanchez, chairman of Obama's National Hispanic Leadership Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a study by the Johns Hopkins Voter Project, the total amount spent targeting Hispanics in the 2004 election, by both major parties and third-party groups combined, was $8.7 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Obama and McCain have been trying to reach Nevada's Hispanic voters with ads on Spanish-language radio. A recent national poll by the Pew Hispanic Center showed Obama taking a commanding two-thirds of the Hispanic vote, while 23 percent supported McCain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and THE ASSOCIATED PRESS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 30-second ad airing in Nevada and 10 other battleground states is the latest in a string of negative ads by Republican presidential candidate John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial unveiled Wednesday seeks to disparage Democrat Barack Obama's manifest popularity by comparing him to lightweight personalities from the paparazzi circuit. It also seeks to hit Obama on energy, as text on the screen states an Obama presidency would lead to &quot;higher taxes&quot; and &quot;more foreign oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just because you're a celebrity doesn't mean you're ready to lead,&quot; campaign manager Rick Davis told reporters in a conference call about the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second McCain&nbsp;ad that tries to turn Obama's popularity on its head. A previous ad asked &quot;Who can you thank for rising prices at the pump?&quot; as a rising crescendo, from an Obama campaign event, chants: &quot;Obama, Obama, Obama!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has opposed lifting a moratorium that blocks energy development in 80 percent of the country's coastal waters. He proposes that oil companies be required to use existing drilling leases or pay a fee. McCain supported the moratorium in the past, but last month called for lifting it. Both Obama and McCain oppose oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign says the ad's claim that Obama would raise taxes on electricity is based on an interview Obama gave the San Antonio Express-News in February. He was asked whether he would help finance education by taxing some new energy sources, such as wind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, that's clean energy, and we want to drive down the cost of that, not raise it,&quot; Obama replied. &quot;We need to give them subsidies so they can start developing that. What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said the reference to taxing &quot;dirty energy&quot; reflects Obama's support for a cap-and-trade system to combat global warming, though Obama has never directly suggested such a plan would be a tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, both McCain and Obama support the same kind of cap-and-trade curbs for carbon-fuel emissions. Industries would be given emission targets; those who come in under their limit could sell their surplus polluting capacity to companies unable to meet their target. Critics claim that's tantamount to a tax on coal-powered industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also wants to end oil and gas industry tax breaks and proposes a windfall profits tax on the large oil companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">campaign dollars</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INCLINE VILLAGE - A fundraiser at Lake Tahoe attended by Republican presidential candidate John McCain netted about $500,000, organizers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 people attended the private event Tuesday afternoon at the Incline Village home of Jan and Bob Davidson, a pioneering couple in the children's computer software industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Tuesday, about 1,250 people attended McCain's town hall meeting in Sparks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Tahoe, McCain first attended a private reception for supporters who paid $33,100 each for VIP tickets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator then spoke to a larger crowd who paid $1,000 for lunch or $2,300 for lunch and a photo with him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Jim Gibbons can't seem to do the smallest thing without ticking somebody off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, it was the Pahrump Town Board, whose members reacted with confusion and anger when Gibbons filled a vacancy on the five-member advisory panel without notifying them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Pahrump Valley Times, Bill Dolan introduced himself as the newly appointed member during the public comment portion of Tuesday's board meeting. His fellow board members didn't know anything about his appointment until that morning, the newspaper reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, the board had yet to accept the resignation of John McDonald, the man Dolan was picked to replace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last time I checked, the governor doesn't live in this town; we do,&quot; board member Dan Sprouse said angrily. &quot;So I think the people in this community ought to have a say-so in who sits on this board.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper reported that board members - excluding Dolan, presumably - plan to send Gibbons a letter to express their displeasure with the way the appointment was handled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What usually happens is the board accepts a resignation and advertises the vacancy, then establishes a sub&shy;committee to review and interview the applicants. At the end of the process, which has been in use since 1997, a list of board-approved nominees is sent to the governor for consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Board Chairwoman Lauranye Murray called the governor's actions &quot;disrespectful.&quot; Dolan was not sworn in at last week's board meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor's spokesman, Ben Kieckhefer, said Dolan was recommended for the post by North Las Vegas Mayor Mike Montandon. Kieck&shy;hefer said he understood some people were unhappy with the process, but the governor's office followed its standard, legal procedure after being notified of the vacancy on the board by the secretary of state's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolan was an unsuccessful candidate for the Assembly and for the North Las Vegas City Council. He has served on the executive board of the Clark County Republican Party and the North Las Vegas Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, details reported by the Pahrump newspaper under a large &quot;Who is Bill Dolan?&quot; headline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kieckhefer said Dolan now lives in Pahrump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCAIN FOLLIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, pundits scored last week a rough one for Republican presidential candidate John McCain. Democratic rival Barack Obama pranced across the Middle East and Europe, while McCain had to call off a planned news conference in New Orleans because of hurricane weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locally, McCain's campaign also was beset by gaffes, including exaggerating the credentials of a supporter and throwing a news conference that wasn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First the campaign rolled out its committee of military veteran supporters at news conferences in Reno and Las Vegas. The events were well attended and the committee substantial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the news release announcing the group prominently quoted &quot;Sean Fellows, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as a member of the Air Force Reserve.&quot; Fellows, a Republican candidate for Assembly, did not serve overseas; he served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, but remotely, piloting drones from bases in Nevada. And he was on active duty at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellows was alarmed by the misrepresentations and immediately contacted the campaign to correct them when they were brought to his attention. A McCain spokesman said the campaign needed to tighten its vetting processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was put together by the state director and vetted through D.C.,&quot; Rick Gorka said. &quot;Any error was purely unintentional. We weren't trying to pump up anybody's service or misrepresent the facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the week, the campaign scheduled another news conference on just a couple hours' notice, summoning reporters to hear state Sen. Bob Beers, R-Las Vegas, and Gus Gutierrez, CEO of Tortillas Inc., talk about the economic impact of high gasoline prices on Gutierrez' North Las Vegas-based business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lone reporter found Gutierrez in his office at the appointed time. He was happy to talk, and spoke about the crunch he's felt not only from increased fuel costs for his 21 trucks, but also soaring corn and wheat prices. Beers was a no-show, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reached by phone later, Beers said he tried to tell the campaign he wasn't going to make it. The reason: He needed to finish up some work before heading up to a blues festival outside Ely, where he planned to show off his banjo skills. Beers began learning to play the banjo about a year and a half ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I figured, not my campaign, not my district,&quot; Beers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether his non&shy;attendance should be construed as a lack of enthusiasm for McCain, Beers said it should not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LATE HELLER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Dean Heller, R-Nev., has some trouble paying his property taxes on time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Carson City assessor's office has charged the congressman late fees 18 times since 1996 for the taxes owed on his property on Plantation Drive, according to online records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together with other charges, such as delinquency notifications, Heller has paid $718 in penalties for the late tax payments, the Washington newspaper Politico reported last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politico included Heller in a list of House candidates who could face criticism on the campaign trail for their handling of their personal finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heller's staff didn't return phone calls seeking an explanation of the late fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHAMBER PICKS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce handed out endorsements to some candidates in primary races last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notably, the chamber endorsed Republican Jon Ozark over incumbent Assemblyman Bob Beers in the GOP primary for Assembly District 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the chamber's Government Affairs Committee, Hugh Anderson, said in a news release that the group was looking for &quot;candidates who embrace pro-business values and who understand the challenges business people face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other candidates endorsed in primary races included incumbent state Sens. Steven Horsford, D-Las Vegas, and Bill Raggio, R-Reno, as well as Assemblyman David Parks, D-Las Vegas, in his state Senate run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Assembly, the chamber endorsed incumbents Morse Arberry, D-Las Vegas, Chad Christensen, R-Las Vegas, and John Marvel, R-Battle Mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chamber also endorsed Clark County Commissioner Bruce Woodbury, a day before the state Supreme Court ruled Woodbury ineligible because of term limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chamber spokeswoman Cara Roberts said Friday the endorsement wouldn't be revisited for the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMMISSION RACE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Woodbury out of the race, the commission contest has become interesting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoping to win the Republican primary, and thus avoid a confusing situation, is longtime GOP activist Brian Scroggins. He lost the 2006 Republican primary for secretary of state to Danny Tarkanian. Scroggins faces Duane Christy in the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroggins had been trying to avoid running against Woodbury while running for his office, just in case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That delicate dance saw him driving a truck and handing out stickers at the Boulder City July 4 parade with the slogan, &quot;If Not Bruce, Then Brian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican political consultant Ryan Erwin has signed on to manage Scroggins' campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Democratic consultant Gary Gray is running University Regent Steve Sisolak's bid for the commission seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sisolak also must clear a primary, against fellow Democrat Jeffrey White.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission district includes parts of Henderson and points south, including Boulder City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans make up 41 percent of the registered voters, Democrats 39 percent; there are 2,700 more Republicans than Democrats and 22,000 nonpartisan voters in the district.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama took to the airwaves in Spanish on Wednesday, airing a radio ad that emphasizes his life story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people have power in connections,&quot; says the ad, which is running on Spanish-language stations in Nevada, New Mexico, Florida and Colorado. &quot;But most of us have to make our own way through life.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spot is Obama's first Spanish-language advertising of the general election. His Republican opponent, John McCain, has already aired a couple of Spanish radio ads in Nevada, as well as an English-language television commercial that extols Hispanics' military service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With swelling strings in the background, the narrator of the new radio ad says of Obama, &quot;He grew up without a father, raised by his mother with the support of his grandparents. Obama never forgot his roots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad touts Obama's work on an Illinois law &quot;that helped reduce the welfare rolls by over 80 percent&quot; and says he &quot;has stood with us for immigration reform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for McCain's campaign objected to the welfare claim, noting that Obama was one of several members of the Illinois state Senate who co-sponsored legislation that was required to implement federal welfare reform passed by President Clinton and the then-Republican Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The achievements he touts aren't even his,&quot; Rick Gorka said. &quot;His record of accomplishments during his time in the state legislature and in Congress is very thin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two campaigns have assailed each other over immigration reform. McCain says he bravely championed the cause last year and Obama tried to kill the legislation with labor-backed &quot;poison pill&quot; amendments. Obama says he has consistently supported comprehensive reform and accuses McCain, who now says border security must come first, of changing his position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conference call with reporters Wednesday, Obama supporter Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., said what would resonate with listeners to the new ad was not the policy but the portrait of a figure Hispanics could identify with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what this ad shows is Barack Obama not only has stood with us, but he is one of us,&quot; Becerra said. &quot;His values are our values. His experiences are our experiences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial that is airing, entitled &quot;Nuestro Propio Camino&quot; (&quot;Our own way&quot;), was altered slightly from a previous version that called Obama the son of an immigrant. The campaign said the change was made because Obama's father, a Kenyan, never truly immigrated to the United States.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tavis Smiley is all wound up. His voice is rough from too much vocalizing, but the host of public television's &quot;Tavis Smiley&quot; talk show and public radio's &quot;The Tavis Smiley Show&quot; is on an oratorical roll about race, politics, and his fellow African-American, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no such thing in America as race transcendence, and Obama's going to find that out real soon,&quot; says Smiley, leaning into his words. As he sermonizes, he sheds suit jacket, tie and belt in succession, getting comfy in his spacious suite at KCET in Los Angeles after taping two installments of &quot;Tavis Smiley&quot; (Monday-Friday in various time-slots on PBS stations). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the peaceful vibe inside his sanctuary, with its African masks and scented candle, Smiley frowns. &quot;There's no such thing as 'post-racial' in America, because if you push the envelope too far, you're going to hear about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smiley should know. For months he has been the object of an Internet firestorm for his perceived negative comments about Obama on commercial radio's syndicated &quot;The Tom Joyner Morning Show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smiley found himself between race and a hard place when he criticized Obama on-air for choosing not to appear on Smiley's annual State of the Black Union cablecast on C-SPAN in February. Smiley's remarks sparked a blaze of invective by African-American bloggers, who questioned Smiley's loyalty, motives and ego.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 12 years as a fixture on Joyner's show, Smiley delivered his final commentary on June 26. Smiley insists his departure was not a reaction to the flak, but rather a decision that he had been on Joyner's show long enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just because Barack Obama is black, doesn't mean he gets a pass on being held accountable on issues that matter to black people,&quot; Smiley says. &quot;I'm not an Obama critic or a McCain critic. The term itself is dismissive and insulting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Smiley a multimedia entrepreneur who is an important voice in the African-American community, who owns his TV and radio shows, who has authored 11 books and created the nonprofit Tavis Smiley Foundation to empower youth the disparagement by black bloggers still stings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His dilemma is also emblematic of the media conundrum of the moment for black and white journalists alike: how to responsibly and sensitively address the issue of race and couch coverage of the likely first-ever run for the White House by a major-party nominee who is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have an awkward history about how to talk about race in the nation and in newsrooms,&quot; says Gwen Ifill, senior correspondent for PBS' &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot; and author of &quot;The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama,&quot; slated for publication early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't see any hesitancy about addressing it,&quot; Ifill says. &quot;But I do think we are all searching for the language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Bohrman, CNN's Washington bureau chief, agrees. &quot;It's still a sensitive topic, but I think the door's been opened to the conversation ... Whether or not that conversation will happen in a reasonable or superficial way I don't think anyone has a real sense of how it will play out right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smiley will broadcast his talk show live to select markets from the Democratic convention in Denver Aug. 25-28 and the Republican convention in St. Paul, Minn., Sept. 1-4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to do what I always try to do, which is to be authentic in my coverage,&quot; Smiley says. &quot;I'm an advocacy journalist, not a journalist in the traditional sense. I believe my role in the media is to get people to re-examine the assumptions they hold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That challenge is not always obvious on Smiley's talk show. In its five-year run &quot;Tavis Smiley&quot; has included a stew of both stars and politicos, from Obama, last fall, and Hillary Clinton in February, to Harrison Ford, Dustin Hoffman, and hip, young-skewing musical guests such as Ne-Yo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is Smiley's role as vigilant media inquisitor and never mind political correctness that he seems to relish most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is what I do asking critical questions,&quot; Smiley says. &quot;Now some of you regard it as keeping a brother down, holding a brother back. Because you regard it that way, you don't understand that this is the role that I've always played.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevadans began seeing their first negative television ads in the presidential race Friday, as Republican John McCain launched a spot sharply critical of Democrat Barack Obama on foreign policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan,&quot; a male announcer states as the screen shows a photo of a laughing Obama holding a microphone. &quot;He hasn't been to Iraq in years. He voted against funding our troops - positions that helped him win his nomination. Now Obama is changing to help himself become president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The music turns from ominous to warm as the narrator says, &quot;John McCain has always supported our troops and the surge that's working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second ad is airing in 11 battleground states, including Nevada, according to McCain's campaign. It comes as Obama is preparing for a much-hyped overseas trip to Europe, Iraq and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama chairs the European Affairs subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and has not, in that role, called hearings on Afghanistan. His campaign counters that Afghanistan would primarily come under a different subcommittee. Obama's campaign also noted that McCain had skipped several hearings on Afghanistan held by the Senate Armed Services Committee, on which McCain serves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has visited Iraq just once, in January 2006, while McCain last went there in March. In May 2007, Obama voted against a military funding bill for Iraq and Afghanistan, although he has voted in favor of all the other war funding bills during his time in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Obama called the ad &quot;patently misleading&quot; and criticized McCain for going negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given his calls for a civil campaign, it's disappointing that Senator McCain has slipped so easily into the same, tired campaign tactics that have become so familiar to the American people,&quot; Bill Burton said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a physical therapist in Las Vegas, I was happy that the House overrode the president's veto of HR 6331 - the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act - which contains key provisions critical for seniors and persons with disabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without the veto, outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech-language pathology services provided in practice settings other than hospital outpatient departments would have been subjected to a financial limit, or &quot;cap&quot; of $1,810 as of July 1. There would have no longer been moratoriums on the cap or an exceptions process in place to be used by patients who required these services. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making matters even worse, therapy services provided during the first six months of this year would have been included in the cap even though the services were provided under the earlier exception. This would have forced patients to pay out-of-pocket for therapy services or even to postpone getting the treatment they need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Studies show that the caps discriminate against the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries such as people who have had a stroke or amputation, people who have experience a traumatic brain injury or people who have multiple disabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress deserves credit for agreeing to change this arbitrary and dangerous policy. We must allow seniors an disabled Americans to receive the rehabilitation services they need. As a nation, we simply cannot afford to wait another day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I usually do not agree with Review-Journal editorials. However, the outrage you expressed regarding the inaction of the Board or Medical Examiners in the Desai case is dead on the money. No physician should be allowed to hold an uninvestigated, unsuspended license with the kind of evidence that has piled up against Dr. Desai. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only explanation is that Dr. Desai, for whatever reason, had/has the board in his pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the holder of two degrees in medical microbiology and as a researcher and teacher of quality assurance in health care in more than two dozen countries, including at one university in India, I can say unequivocally that if the allegations against him are true, Dr. Desai's behavior is not in the realm of malpractice, but rather, criminality. Such blatant violations of standard aseptic practice cannot arise from lack of awareness; they have to be willful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My students in Bacteriology 101 know better than that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, I am very sympathetic to the point raised by Dr. Cyriac Chemplavil in his recent letter. The entire Indian medical community should absolutely not be tarred with same brush as Dr. Desai. The despicable greed of Dr. Desai is personal and not at all reflective of a common trait in that community. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recently read a series of articles which proudly disclosed that the powerful growth-oriented commercial interests of Southern Nevada have enlisted the services of Sen. Harry Reid to work with Pat Mulroy of the Southern Nevada Water Authority in bringing northern Nevada water to Las Vegas. These efforts continue to ignore the finite environmental accommodations available for this arid desert area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, I've also observed that the mere suggestion of new energy production in our Congress provokes a massive reference to &quot;pristine areas.&quot; From Alaska to Colorado shale, to our coastline and even beyond, everything is now &quot;pristine,&quot; and thus, untouchable. Our own Sen. Reid consistently leads this &quot;pristine&quot; mantra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet when the water authority is manipulating a political effort to extract the water from the Great Basin Desert and Spring Valley areas of Nevada, I hear not a single concern by Sen. Reid for these &quot;pristine&quot; areas. With sucking straws and massive pipelines headed into these beautiful, environmentally sensitive areas, why the political silence? Why Sen. Reid's efforts to accomplish this disastrous mining of northern Nevada water?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, why is the entire United States so &quot;pristine&quot; for Sen. Reid, except for our treasured northern Nevada high desert area?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read with great interest Mike Zahara's July 5 appraisal of Sen. Harry Reid's bungling, bureaucratic behavior - with which I totally concur. One glaring point that immediately caught my attention was the use of individually owned solar energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We retired to Henderson almost 17 years ago and I was shocked to note that with so many days of sunshine solar had not been used. Eleven years prior to our moving to Nevada from western New York, we had solar panels installed on the roof of our residence with the following results:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. We saved approximately 43 percent in our energy costs, (and that was in a colder climate).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. New York state did indeed grant tax credits, saving us a great deal of the original expense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I still find it difficult to believe that Nevada is so far behind in this energy-saving endeavor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new campaign ad airing in Nevada and other states highlights Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's work to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons smuggling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second television spot begins with Obama standing and addressing a town-hall audience. &quot;We are a beacon of light around the world,&quot; Obama says. &quot;At least that's what we can be again. That's what we should be again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad then shows Obama addressing the camera, saying, &quot;The single most important national security threat we face is nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.&quot; An image comes onscreen of bearded men with a stash of weapons, including rockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama touts his work with Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., &quot;to help lock down loose nuclear weapons,&quot; a reference to nonproliferation legislation the two co-sponsored that passed last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign said the ad would air in Nevada and 17 other states selected as top battlegrounds, alongside a previously released ad about the dignity of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's Republican opponent, John McCain, criticized him Tuesday for presenting a strategy for dealing with Iraq and Afghanistan ahead of a planned trip to those countries, rather than after such a visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also has been airing TV commercials in Nevada. The most recent pays tribute to Hispanics in the military.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuing his bid to attract Hispanic voters in Nevada, Republican presidential candidate John McCain began a new television ad Friday that pays tribute to Hispanics in the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 60-second spot shows McCain speaking during a June 2007 Republican primary debate in New Hampshire, at a time when he was taking considerable heat from his rivals for the nomination for having co-sponsored immigration reform legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My friends, I want you, the next time you're in Washington, D.C., to go to the Vietnam War Memorial and look at the names engraved in black granite,&quot; McCain says. &quot;You'll find a whole lot of Hispanic names.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He goes on to note that many troops in Iraq and Afghanistan today are Hispanic, including some who are green card holders, not citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So let's from time to time remember that these are God's children,&quot; McCain says. &quot;They must come into the country legally, but they have enriched our culture and our nation, as every generation of immigrants before them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad does not mention McCain's position on immigration. After co-sponsoring with Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., the failed bill that many on the right termed &quot;amnesty&quot; because it would have allowed some illegal immigrants eventually to become citizens, McCain seemed to back away from the political hot button. At a later primary debate, he said he would no longer vote for his own reform bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla., said Friday the idea that McCain had abandoned immigration reform was a myth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the ad highlights what is really the straight story on Senator McCain and immigration,&quot; Martinez said during a conference call with reporters. &quot;Far from running away from the issue during the primary, as is falsely and shamefully claimed, in fact he stood tall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martinez said it was McCain's Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, who had been hypocritical on the issue. He pointed to Obama's work on amendments to the reform bill that he termed &quot;poison pills&quot; that, if approved, would have doomed the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it counted, when the chips were down, when Senator Kennedy, Senator McCain and I were desperate to round up votes and keep the coalition intact, Senator Obama was destroying it by offering amendments that would have killed it,&quot; Martinez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign, however, pointed to a letter Martinez sent to Obama after the bill died, in June 2007, thanking him for &quot;standing firm in the face of extreme pressure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Martinez also said McCain remains committed to resolving the situation of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not walked away from dealing with the 12 million. He's not walked away from the need for comprehensive immigration reform,&quot; Martinez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in an interview with the Review-Journal in Las Vegas last month, McCain said immigration reform was as &quot;over&quot; as his old bid to ban college sports betting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The issue of college betting is over. It's not going to go anywhere, obviously,&quot; McCain said, adding, &quot;The sports betting thing, that was over years ago. That was a position that I had and it's done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he had changed his mind, he said, &quot;I've faced reality, just like immigration reform. Americans want the borders secured first. It's over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new McCain television spot is airing in Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado. It comes in addition to two ads McCain has aired on Spanish-language radio in Nevada and New Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first radio ad, McCain pitched bipartisanship and economic concerns. In the second, his roommate from the U.S. Naval Academy, Frank Gamboa, says McCain shares Latino values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has earned the trust of Latinos and has a history of supporting us,&quot; Gamboa says of McCain, according to a translation by the campaign. &quot;This election, it seems to me that the other candidate has just discovered the importance of the Hispanic vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the television ad is pitched at Hispanics, it is not airing on Spanish-language television, only on statewide English-language broadcast networks. A source with knowledge of the matter said the McCain campaign had reserved ad time on Spanish-language television in Las Vegas and Reno but pulled the ad from those stations at the last minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has not yet matched McCain's effort to court Hispanic voters. An Obama spokeswoman said the campaign &quot;remains strongly committed to investing in outreach to Hispanic voters, and that will be reflected in all aspects of our campaign moving forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign is planning to announce early next week a group of prominent Nevada Hispanics who support McCain , led by Fernando Romero, a longtime political organizer who is the president of the local group Hispanics in Politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romero, a Democrat who previously worked on the presidential primary campaign of New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, said Obama does not have McCain's history with the Hispanic community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain has been there,&quot; he said. &quot;The history of supporting our community is there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCRIPT: McCain, addressing immigration at a Republican primary debate on June 5, 2007, in New Hampshire: &quot;My friends, I want you the next time you're down in Washington, D.C., to go to the Vietnam War Memorial and look at the names engraved in black granite. You'll find a whole lot of Hispanic names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you go to Iraq or Afghanistan today, you're going to see a whole lot of people who are of Hispanic background. You're even going to meet some of the few thousand that are still green card holders who are not even citizens of this country, who love this country so much that they're willing to risk their lives in its service in order to accelerate their path to citizenship and enjoy the bountiful, blessed nation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So let's from time to time remember that these are God's children. They must come into country legally, but they have enriched our culture and our nation as every generation of immigrants before them. Thank you.&quot; (Applause)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KEY IMAGES: As McCain speaks a series of photographs of the Vietnam and Korean war memorials appear on the screen. Superimposed are the phrases &quot;Look at the Names&quot; and &quot;Green card holders defending America&quot; and &quot;Love of this country.&quot; The ad then picks up with video of McCain continuing his remarks at the debate as his Republican rivals and the audience look on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANALYSIS: By emphasizing patriotism in a pro-immigrant message, McCain is making a direct appeal to Hispanic and Latino voters without highlighting his past support for overhauling immigration laws. After all, immigration is one of those issues that gets McCain in trouble with conservative voters. Last year, McCain supported legislation that would have given a path to citizenship to millions of immigrants living illegally in the United States. The legislation also called for securing the nation's borders. But the bill ultimately failed, freighted by criticism that its provisions for undocumented workers amounted to &quot;amnesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's support for the legislation was partly responsible for his campaign's tailspin last summer that nearly crippled his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the immigration bill's defeat last year, McCain began to stress the need for border security. He has argued that the public would not accept overall changes in immigration law without Congress first enacting laws to stanch the flow of illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain Democratic rival, Barack Obama, has criticized McCain for backing away from his commitment to the legislation that McCain and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., helped draft. McCain and his allies, in turn, criticize Obama for supporting labor-backed amendments to the legislation that would have undermined its chance for Senate approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides on Friday held a teleconference with Sen. Mel Martinez, a Florida Republican who supported the immigration legislation. The ad, however, is not running in Florida, which has a large Hispanic population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the ad does not address McCain's work with Kennedy on the bill, Martinez did: &quot;Not only is Sen. McCain clear in what his purpose was during the immigration effort, he was at the genesis of it. He led the origins of this efforts, which is why the bill was called the McCain-Kennedy immigration reform bill. He has been for comprehensive immigration reform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martinez slammed Obama for his votes on amendments that he said were &quot;poison pills&quot; that would have doomed the legislation. In a letter to Obama dated June 28, 2007, however, Martinez offered praise to Obama. &quot;I know that standing firm in the face of extreme pressure has not been easy, and again, I thank you,&quot; Martinez wrote. The letter was first reported by Politico.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain began airing a new television ad in Nevada on Tuesday that touts his service to his country, as a prisoner of war and a politician. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In clipped diction, the ad, &quot;Love,&quot; contrasts McCain's years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam in the 1960s with the countercultural movement of the same era, and his maverick image with the vague promise of &quot;hope.&quot; Both seem to be implied jabs at his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a time of uncertainty, hope and change: the 'Summer of Love,' &quot; a male narrator says over images of protests and Woodstock. &quot;Half a world away, another kind of love: of country. John McCain: shot down, bayoneted, tortured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photos and video clips look back on McCain's military career and political life, including his homecoming from imprisonment, meeting President Reagan and shaking hands on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A maverick, John McCain tackled campaign reform, military reform, spending reform,&quot; the ad states. &quot;He took on presidents, partisans and popular opinion. He believes our world is dangerous, our economy in shambles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain doesn't always tell us what we 'hope' to hear. Beautiful words cannot make our lives better. ... Don't 'hope' for a better life, vote for one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the ad does not mention Obama, &quot;hope&quot; and &quot;change&quot; are the top buzzwords of the Democrat's campaign. McCain has sought to paint Obama as inexperienced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 60-second ad is the fourth campaign message McCain has put up in Nevada and 10 other states targeted as battlegrounds across the country. Others addressed national security and energy policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has also targeted Nevada with two ads, along with 17 other states.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do you register 60,000 new voters? One at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Department of Motor Vehicles office on East Sahara Avenue last week, Ana Ramos was following Mike Wilson into the parking lot. The 24-year-old Wilson admitted he wasn't registered to vote, but didn't stop walking by Ramos and her clipboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walking alongside him, Ramos bugged Wilson, told him it was easy to fill out the form, that this year's election was going to be important and it was the right thing to do. It would take only a minute, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were almost to Wilson's car by the time he relented and started writing down his address. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Ramos, 22, a canvasser for the social advocacy group ACORN, it was another small victory. Signing up voters, not the $8 per hour she earns, is what makes it worth her while to spend the day in 100-plus-degree heat chasing people down, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Wilson, he was warming to the idea of voting for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time for a change,&quot; the Las Vegas audio engineer said after filling out the form. &quot;I've been avoiding it for a long time. I might as well try and make a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson signed up as a Democrat but doesn't know for whom he'll vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not really into the whole politics thing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People like Ramos and Wilson are the faces behind voter registration numbers, in Nevada and across the country, that are climbing at staggering rates this year as Americans sign up to participate in a historic presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts have attributed much of the surge to interest in the election and enthusiasm for Democratic candidate Barack Obama among young people and blacks, traditionally two groups that register and vote at lower rates than the population as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as a day spent with canvassers showed, the new voters aren't lining up at the county building to register themselves. Rather, they're being aggressively recruited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We approach them. We bring the issue to them,&quot; said Chris Edwards, ACORN's Nevada field director. &quot;We don't wait for them to come to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACORN, which stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, claims to have collected 60,000 new voter registrations in Clark County since February. The group, which works to promote the interests of lower-income people, is aiming for 100,000 by Labor Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clark County Registrar of Voters Larry Lomax said he has never seen such a deluge. &quot;The biggest year we ever had was 2004. That year, we processed almost 300,000 (voter) applications - 291,000, to be exact. We're running double that rate right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of this point in 2004, the Clark County Election Department had received 81,000 applications; this year, it's 161,000, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Census, nationally about two-thirds of those eligible to vote - U.S. citizens who are over 18 and have not had their voting rights revoked for a criminal conviction - are registered; in Nevada, it's just 56 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACORN's canvassers, drawn from the ranks of the lower income themselves, work outside welfare offices, free clinics and downmarket stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the group is nonpartisan, it has an overt agenda of making government do more for the poor; it sees getting lower-income people to vote as a way of forcing politicians to address their concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACORN's tactics are controversial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has drawn accusations of voter fraud and criminal investigations in several states. Last year, authorities in Washington state brought felony charges against ACORN workers for filing false voter registrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some ACORN workers pleaded guilty and went to jail, while the organization paid $25,000 and agreed to have its registration efforts monitored in a settlement with Washington state authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lomax said while he supports the goal of getting more people registered to vote, he sees rampant fraud in the 2,000 to 3,000 registrations ACORN turns in every week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whenever people get paid to register voters, those individuals have an incentive to meet their quota, and that results sometimes in people doing things they shouldn't,&quot; Lomax said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His office sends out thousands of letters based on registration applications that don't have valid addresses or Social Security numbers, or have other suspicious irregularities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The office also receives frequent complaints from people who have been notified of changes in their registration that they say they didn't make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no question it's a crime. It says right there on the form it's a felony to put down false voter registration information,&quot; said Lomax, who is working with authorities to see what can be done. &quot;It's very difficult to prosecute someone on something like this, because you have to prove it's intentional and determine whose fault it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lomax recommends voters check the Election Department's Web site at www.accessclarkcounty.com/</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">depts/election/ or call 455-VOTE (8683), to make sure their registration is in order and avoid problems when they go to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwards, a former union organizer, dismissed the allegations of fraud as the politically motivated accusations of elites who feel threatened by the prospect of the proletariat storming the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Robin Hood was controversial, too,&quot; he said. &quot;When you are in the vanguard, working for the working class, there are always going to be people who don't want you to succeed for their own selfish reasons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwards and the political organizers who work under him hold orientation sessions every afternoon at ACORN's Las Vegas headquarters, a threadbare suite in a threadbare building in the Commercial Center complex on Sahara east of the Strip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group plans to open a second office, in Henderson, this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a recent afternoon, the room on Sahara held about 20 people, a down-and-out looking group drawn to the spot by fliers promising hourly work they could start right away. &quot;WE GOT JOBS!!&quot; the fliers blared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizer Alicia Estrada asked them to state their names, where they came from and &quot;something you would like to change about society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took some prodding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People mentioned their inter&shy;actions with police and the criminal justice system, the price of gasoline, money for schools, income inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My name's Deborah. I'm from Wisconsin,&quot; a woman said. &quot;I just came here because I need a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What would you like to change about society?&quot; Estrada said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More jobs, I guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estrada told the would-be canvassers what they were in for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I used to be a cashier when I was in college. I'm sure a lot of you had jobs like that, where it's just a routine. You spend all day scanning stuff and putting it in bags, and at the end of the day, did you really make a difference? No, you didn't. The next morning you're just going to do the same thing, and nothing's going to change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Canvassing is hard. It's 100-some degrees out. We pay $8 an hour, but it's not about the $8 an hour. You encounter so many people doing this job, so many different stories. People who lost their homes. People who just became citizens. We registered an 82-year-old man who never voted before. He said, 'It's a historic election year. This time I'm going to vote.' That's what this job is about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estrada explained what information goes on the voter registration form, that all the forms need to be turned in and that it's illegal to falsify them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She emphasized getting phone numbers so that the organization can call the new voters on Election Day and make sure they vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She cautioned that canvassers cannot tell people for whom to vote or with what party to register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then she turned the floor over to Edwards. Drawing on a white board at the front of the room, he gave a rabble-rousing presentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's one of the most reliable and harmful axioms in American politics,&quot; he said, writing it on the board: &quot;POOR PEOPLE DON'T VOTE.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, if the policy is made by elected officials, and elected officials work for their constituency, and their constituency is all the people who vote, and poor people don't vote, who are they not working for? It's very simple.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a vicious cycle, Edwards said, pacing the room and sometimes shouting for emphasis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So how do we break the cycle? We have to blow this up, break this axiom that poor people don't vote,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to destroy it. You might ask me, 'Is this class warfare, Chris? Is that what you're saying: &quot;Off with the rich people's heads?&quot;' No, no, exactly the opposite. We believe equality of representation and opportunity benefits the entire society, rich and poor alike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was applause when he finished his speech, leaving the room to Estrada, who started signing up the people who wanted to give it a try. Several didn't, and filed out of the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down at the Department of Motor Vehicles office on East Sahara Avenue, Ana Ramos was catching the last of the customers as they trickled out after closing time. The day's high temperature was 109.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dressed in a lacy black tank top and baggy blue-and-white striped pants, she had a tube of sunscreen sticking out of one back pocket and a little American flag on a plastic pole sticking out of the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vanessa Curiel, 19, was studying the voter form reluctantly. She was trying to figure out which box to check for political party affiliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republican, that's McCain,&quot; Ramos explained. &quot;Democrat is Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama?&quot; Curiel said. &quot;What's that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guy that's running for president,&quot; Ramos said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, OK,&quot; Curiel said, checking the Democrat box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curiel said voting was not something she thought about much, and she probably would not have registered if she hadn't been asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to vote for president. Maybe this president will make it better. Things are pretty bad right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Monday began airing his second television ad in Nevada since beginning his general-election campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, entitled &quot;Dignity,&quot; stresses Obama's legislative accomplishments as an Illinois state senator, portraying him as a champion of workers and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He passed a law to move people from welfare to work - slashed the rolls by 80 percent,&quot; a voice-over states. &quot;Passed tax cuts for workers, health care for kids.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photos and video show Obama on the phone, at a desk, meeting with workers and speaking to crowds. In the last frame, Obama hugs a woman in an apron and hairnet in a kitchen setting. Text on the screen references &quot;The Obama record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second spot is airing in Nevada and 17 other states targeted as battlegrounds by the campaign. It follows a debut spot in which Obama talked about values inherited from his grandparents from Kansas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's Republican opponent, John McCain, has so far aired three TV ads in Nevada and other battleground states.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget his personal scandals or 21 percent approval rating. The real reason Gov. Jim Gibbons was passed over to chair John McCain's campaign in Nevada was a speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign officials were peeved by Gibbons' speech at the state Republican convention, which they saw as insufficiently supportive of the GOP presidential candidate, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign selected Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki to be the Nevada campaign chairman instead, a move that struck many as a snub of Gibbons. During a visit to Las Vegas last week, McCain denied that, saying he and Krolicki go way back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the April 26 convention, Gibbons' speech focused on state issues and his determination not to increase taxes in the face of budget challenges. Near the end, he did mention the party's presidential candidate, saying, &quot;I believe we have a strong ticket for this November, headed by Senator John McCain, the next president of the United States.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The source said that was seen as too tepid by the Arizona senator's campaign, especially after Gibbons' admission at a previous Republican convention that he hadn't voted for McCain at the Nevada caucus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When McCain visited Reno on May 28, Gibbons originally had been designated as the official who would meet him at the airport and introduce him at the fundraiser at the Eldorado Hotel Casino, but the invitation was withdrawn, the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a deliberate slap to Gibbons, his estranged wife, Dawn, was asked to meet McCain at the airport instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the matter, Gibbons spokesman Ben Kieckhefer said he knew of no dis&shy;invitation or dissatisfaction with the speech, which Kieckhefer said he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meeting McCain at the airport, he said, &quot;was never on the schedule.&quot; Gibbons attended the fundraiser, Kieckhefer noted. &quot;That's all that was ever on his schedule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the speech, he said, &quot;I think it was a pretty strong endorsement of Senator McCain. I wrote it to be that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EL PRESIDENTE?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has been making a play for the Hispanic vote in Nevada, airing ads on Spanish-language radio. In Las Vegas, he has picked up at least one influential Hispanic supporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fernando Romero, president of Hispanics in Politics, came out to see McCain as the candidate met with volunteers Wednesday at his new office in Henderson. A Democrat, Romero said he is crossing party lines to support McCain. (He noted that he was speaking only for himself, not Hispanics in Politics, which is nonpartisan and has yet to make an endorsement.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is a proven entity. He has been there for us,&quot; Romero said. &quot;He has a track record with the Hispanic community, not just this campaign but the whole time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romero worked on the Democratic primary campaign of New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who dropped out before the Nevada caucuses. After that, Romero supported Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Clinton ended her campaign, Romero said he considered supporting Barack Obama, the Democrats' presumptive nominee, but Obama's campaign made no effort to reach out to him and didn't return his phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of us in the Hispanic community are Democrats, but the Obama campaign is not reaching out to us at all,&quot; he said. &quot;They seem to expect us to come to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romero said he had an easy time deciding to support McCain partly because of McCain's past support for comprehensive immigration reform, although McCain has backed off that stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romero said he also was impressed by McCain's work building ties with Latin America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His views are not as conservative as most Republicans would want,&quot; Romero said of McCain. &quot;But he fits, in my opinion, right into Nevada's philosophy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT THE RODEO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nevada Appeal on Friday published photos of Gov. Jim Gibbons at the Reno rodeo with another woman he says is just a friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of the photos, Gibbons and the woman, Leslie Durant, can be seen embracing in a dark parking lot. Durant is the ex-wife of former Reno Mayor Pete Sferrazza and appeared in Playboy magazine in 1989. She is not the woman with whom Gibbons used a state phone to exchange more than 800 text messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Appeal was there to cover the rodeo, according to an editorial by Editor Barry Ginter that ran with the photos. In its previous report on the rodeo, the paper had noted that the governor and his companion were holding hands, but stopped when they saw they were being photographed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbons told the Appeal that his friend was &quot;upset&quot; and he was comforting her. On Friday, when the photos were the buzz of the Legislature's special session, the Las Vegas Sun published on its Web site a previously conducted interview in which Gibbons said he had to get close to his friend because it was noisy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbons told the Sun it's hard to be romantic about someone you've seen go through childbirth, and &quot;I held her hand when her child was born.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ginter, in the Appeal editorial, opined that Gibbons' many pleas for privacy in the face of such revelations ring hollow when he seems to insist on flaunting his private affairs in front of his constituents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were probably few other places in Northern Nevada that night where more people could be found than where he chose to hold hands with his friend,&quot; Ginter wrote. &quot;... The only conclusion that makes sense to me is that the governor wanted to be seen with his companion. I don't know why he decided that was wise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENERGY APPEAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain continues to mix it up in his Nevada television advertising. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, he started airing a new commercial, this one reinforcing the message about energy security that he brought to Las Vegas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American technology protected the world,&quot; a male announcer intones in the new 30-second commercial as the camera pans across a grid of images, starting with black-and-white shots of the moon landing and moving on to a gas station, pumping oil rigs, wind turbines and solar panels. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We went to the moon not because it was easy, but because it was hard,&quot; the ad says. &quot;John McCain will call America to our next national purpose, energy security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is McCain's third message to a handful of swing states including Nevada. Previous ads were about war and global warming. The new commercial illustrates the mileage the campaign hopes to get out of the energy issue, a major topic of late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the global warming ad, which was flashy and dramatic, the energy security ad has the slicker feel of a corporate presentation and shows the candidate speaking at a lectern in a suit and tie, rather than surveying the outdoors in an untucked shirt and ball cap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad touts McCain's plan to drill for oil domestically and pursue alternative sources of energy. It ends with a new slogan: &quot;Putting country first.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama also has included Nevada on his early roster of swing-state advertising, with a single spot that focuses on his family, values and devotion to his country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his book-promotion stopover here, former White House press secretary Scott McClellan was squired around by a &quot;literary escort,&quot; a pleasant woman named Naomi who drives visiting authors to their speaking engagements in a blue convertible. There were no motorcades, no street closures, no Secret Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McClellan slept at a Marriott Hotel, a couple of notches down from the Beverly Wilshire where he, President Bush and the rest of the White House entourage stayed when in Southern California. Where he once spoke with the mighty White House seal behind him, McClellan addressed a crowd here in front of a humble fabric backdrop emblazoned with the words &quot;Commonwealth Club.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a long way from the Oval Office, where McClellan once basked in the confidence of the president, to the book circuit, where he is delivering a sharp critique of that president. But nearly a month after the explosive book's release, McClellan seems comfortable in his new role, polishing his one-liners about Dick Cheney, relishing largely sympathetic audiences and accepting his exile from certain ex-colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a number of former colleagues that, they were friends before and they're friends today and will continue to be,&quot; McClellan said in an interview Tuesday. &quot;I hope someday that others can step back from this and I can maybe renew some of those friendships. I don't know if that'll happen or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an example, he cites the current White House press secretary, Dana Perino. McClellan's book forced her earlier this month to defend the truthfulness of a White House McClellan called in a state of &quot;permanent campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You certainly find out who your true friends are at a time like this,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has not heard from Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the lectern, McClellan is looser and funnier than he was in the hot glare of the White House press room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It probably helps that his book tour has taken him to such &quot;blue&quot; cities as Santa Monica and Austin, Texas. In Seattle, a sold-out crowd of 850 gave him a standing ovation Monday night. In San Francisco, a liberal city Bush has never visited as president, McClellan was drowned out by applause as he said, &quot;the war in Iraq was not absolutely necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McClellan has incorporated some crowd-pleasing titles of books he imagines his former White House comrades writing:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I Upped Halliburton's Income, So Up Yours,&quot; by Dick Cheney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Lies I Told, to Whom and Why,&quot; by Karl Rove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, Paaaaaardon Me!&quot; by Scooter Libby, convicted in the case of the leaked identity of a CIA operative, and perhaps hoping for a presidential pardon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jokes loosen up a crowd of 550 San Franciscans in the middle of a work day and appears to crack McClellan himself up. Then he moves into the serious part of what has become his &quot;stump speech,&quot; an overview of the book, &quot;What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington's Culture of Deception.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book accuses Bush of orchestrating a &quot;political propaganda campaign to sell the war to the American people,&quot; trying to make the &quot;WMD threat and the Iraqi connection to terrorism appear just a little more certain, a little less questionable than they were.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading at times from prepared notes, McClellan acknowledges, as he does in the book, that he was swept away by trust for the president and the intelligence he assumed top national-security aides must have had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reflecting for many months after leaving the White House, &quot;I realized how badly misplaced my trust was,&quot; McClellan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McClellan is eager to answer critics who say he should have spoken up from inside the White House, where, the critics say, he might have had the chance to sway events, rather than after he had resigned in 2006. It took time to get perspective, for his ideas to marinate, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not until July 2007 that he began to write the book, and he pushed his deadline back a couple times, finishing the manuscript in mid-April of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the truth as best I know it from my perspective,&quot; he told the audience here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McClellan is a little fuzzy on certain questions of his future. Whom will he vote for, John McCain or Barack Obama? Not sure yet. Will he change parties, as he has done once before? Hasn't made up his mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How will he make a living, now that the president of the United States and so many other influential Republicans consider him a traitor?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wants to change Washington's culture, and believes, based on the reception he says his book is getting, that the public hungers for that, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond that, he says he not sure about work, though he's considering academia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he spoke, McClellan's book remained No. 2 on The New York Times best seller list and No. 14 at Amazon.com. With a relatively small $75,000 book advance, does he stand to make a lot of money?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have no idea. I haven't seen it if I do,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not the purpose of this book.&quot; McClellan said his book contract is structured such that he will get a &quot;small percentage&quot; of sales after the publisher recoups its $75,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He serves on the advisory council of Apco Worldwide, a Washington D.C.-based public relations and issue-management company, in a &quot;part-time consulting&quot; role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess I'm still thinking it all through, what's next for me,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have no regrets about writing this book whatsoever,&quot; McClellan said. But, he added, &quot;I know it closed some doors to me; hopefully it will open some up new opportunities where I can continue to work on what I talk about in the book,&quot; especially changing Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the next few days, it's back on the road destination, Talahassee, Fla., for a speech on Thursday. He's accustomed to the travel from countless campaign trips with Bush, but today he's on a different campaign: his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most people realize that when you're speaking for the president, you're speaking for his decisions and policies. This was a chance for me to speak for myself,&quot; McClellan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But from here, McClellan will travel alone, without even his wife, Jill. No pomp, no pageantry, no more Air Force One just literary escorts around town and commercial flights carrying him into an uncertain future.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAS VEGAS </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After fending off ocean drilling critics in California, Republican John McCain on Wednesday stiff-armed opponents of a Nevada nuclear waste repository as he outlined ways to resolve the nation's energy crisis while seeking votes in another swing state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential candidate reiterated his call for building 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030 and a total of 100 at some point beyond that during a speech at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. Despite the waste they might generate, McCain said they are part of a comprehensive strategy he has taken to calling the &quot;Lexington Project,&quot; for the Revolutionary War site. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain didn't repeat his recent suggestion that the waste site at Yucca Mountain may be rendered unnecessary if the world can agree on a location for a foreign repository. That comment in Texas drew cries of disbelief from critics who accused him of pandering after long supporting Yucca.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides say the policies conform with the Arizona senator's straight-talk reputation and contrast with opposition from Democratic rival Barack Obama, whom they have taken to calling &quot;Dr. No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The experience of nations across Europe and Asia has shown that nuclear energy is efficient. It is safe, it is proven, and it is essential to America's energy future,&quot; McCain said during his speech. &quot;We will need to recover all the knowledge and skills that have been lost over three stagnant decades in a highly technical field. As Nevadans are well aware, we will need to solve complex problems of moving and storing materials that will always need safeguarding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unclear the degree to which the Yucca controversy moves votes in this fast-growing state. And Obama opened himself to similar criticism this week when he suggested nuclear power had to be explored as the nation copes with record gasoline prices now heading toward an average of $5 a gallon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain is fighting a Democratic tide in Nevada. In 2004, when President Bush narrowly beat Democrat John Kerry in the presidential race, there were 358,000 Republicans in the state to 348,000 Democrats. There are now 438,000 Democrats and 388,000 Republicans in Nevada, thanks to intense voter registration drives before party caucuses this winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have also been plagued by state-party chaos and personal problems involving their nominal leader, Gov. Jim Gibbons. He filed for divorce earlier this month and has moved out of the governor's mansion. This week he apologized for sending 860 text messages through a state-owned cell phone to the estranged wife of a Reno doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the first time really in about 20 years that the Democrats have had this large registration lead over the Republicans,&quot; said Eric Herzik, a registered Republican who is a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Reno. &quot;It's reflective of better organization by the Democrats. It's reflective of really what may be motivation by the Democrats to, as they say, 'turn Nevada blue.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clark County Commissioner Rory Reid, son of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said: &quot;While Senator McCain believes that Nevada is a wasteland, Senator Obama has a plan that will develop the tremendous potential we have here for alternative energy sources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reid said Obama's plan to invest $150 billion in alternate energy resources appeals to Nevadans. &quot;We have more sunshine then we know what to do with,&quot; the commissioner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also has made solar power, as well as the development of electric cars and the use of alcohol-based fuels such as ethanol, part of his Lexington Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., a McCain supporter, told reporters Wednesday, &quot;Senator McCain's energy policy is a balanced policy&quot; featuring expanded production, conservation and funding for developing alternative energy sources. Earlier this week, McCain proposed a $300 million prize for anyone who could develop a revolutionary battery pack for automobiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama branded the proposal a gimmick, despite using his Web site to suggest cash prizes for developing the next generation of biofuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing really points out Senator Obama's Dr. No-attitude toward energy security than his comments yesterday calling this a gimmick,&quot; said McCain spokesman Brian Rogers. McCain repeats the moniker in a new Web ad set to the James Bond theme music in homage to the movie villain Dr. No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elaine Bunker, a 42-year-old English teacher from Las Vegas, attended McCain's speech but said she's only reluctantly supporting the senator. Her first choice was rival Mitt Romney, now mentioned as a possible running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bunker said Yucca Mountain isn't factoring into her vote and she doesn't trust much of the political talk about the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have a strong feeling. So often it gets caught up in the rhetoric,&quot; she said. &quot;I think it should be based on science. If the science says it's safe then we should go ahead, if it doesn't then we shouldn't. But it's so hard to sort out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the speech, McCain greeted volunteers at the opening of his regional headquarters in Henderson, Nev. He told the small group of mostly elderly supporters that Nevada and the West would be critical to his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has hired Vaughn Ward, a former Marine who served in Iraq, as his Nevada state director. Jennifer Clarke is the deputy regional campaign manager, Jessica Patterson is the Republican National Committee's Victory campaign executive cirector for Nevada.</SPAN></P>

Last week he apologized for sending 860 text messages through a state-owned cell phone to the estranged wife of a Reno doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the first time really in about 20 years that the Democrats have had this large registration lead over the Republicans,&quot; said Eric Herzik, a registered Republican who is a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Reno. &quot;It's reflective of better organization by the Democrats. It's reflective of really what may be motivation by the Democrats to, as they say, 'turn Nevada blue.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clark County Commissioner Rory Reid, son of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said: &quot;While Senator McCain believes that Nevada is a wasteland, Senator Obama has a plan that will develop the tremendous potential we have here for alternative energy sources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reid said Obama's plan to invest $150 billion in alternate energy resources appeals to Nevadans. &quot;We have more sunshine then we know what to do with,&quot; the commissioner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also has made solar power, as well as the development of electric cars and the use of alcohol-based fuels such as ethanol, part of his Lexington Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., a McCain supporter, told reporters Wednesday, &quot;Senator McCain's energy policy is a balanced policy&quot; featuring expanded production, conservation and funding for developing alternative energy sources. Earlier this week, McCain proposed a $300 million prize for anyone who could develop a revolutionary battery pack for automobiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama branded the proposal a gimmick, despite using his Web site to suggest cash prizes for developing the next generation of biofuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing really points out Senator Obama's Dr. No-attitude toward energy security than his comments yesterday calling this a gimmick,&quot; said McCain spokesman Brian Rogers. McCain repeats the moniker in a new Web ad set to the James Bond theme music in homage to the movie villain Dr. No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elaine Bunker, a 42-year-old English teacher from Las Vegas, attended McCain's speech but said she's only reluctantly supporting the senator. Her first choice was rival Mitt Romney, now mentioned as a possible running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bunker said Yucca Mountain isn't factoring into her vote and she doesn't trust much of the political talk about the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have a strong feeling. So often it gets caught up in the rhetoric,&quot; she said. &quot;I think it should be based on science. If the science says it's safe then we should go ahead, if it doesn't then we shouldn't. But it's so hard to sort out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the speech, McCain greeted volunteers at the opening of his regional headquarters in Henderson, Nev. He told the small group of mostly elderly supporters that Nevada and the West would be critical to his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has hired Vaughn Ward, a former Marine who served in Iraq, as his Nevada state director. Jennifer Clarke is the deputy regional campaign manager, Jessica Patterson is the Republican National Committee's Victory campaign executive cirector for Nevada.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While you battle the onset of extreme temperatures, the presidential candidates are already waging war here in the West's best bellwether state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've heard national pundits return to crowing about Ohio and Florida, with their huge caches of electoral votes, but Democrats are eyeing smaller Western states to help Barack Obama win the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while New Mexico has been trending blue for some time, Nevada is only now morphing out of purple and into a more bluish hue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battle here will be intense, and the major party candidates - who again chase each other in Nevada this week - will have dozens of opportunities to press the flesh as the year continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumptive Republican nominee John McCain has been setting the agenda here thus far (first on the air with a commercial and first to announce two visits). Obama has subsequently gone on the air and has scheduled trips to Nevada to coincide with McCain's trips last month and this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent polls by both Rasmussen and Mason-Dixon show the presidential race is essentially a toss-up here. McCain is up slightly on Obama, but not outside of the margin of error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this week signaled an advantage for Obama not evident on the air, in the public events or the polls. On Monday, Hillary Clinton's supporters did their best &quot;Kumbaya&quot; with an announcement of statewide unity, however forced, behind Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is really the week in which Obama will finally step out from the contentious primary battle and reach out to Clinton's most ardent fans. There's a joint campaign event scheduled for Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous Clinton supporters, including her delegates and leaders of her campaign, announced Monday they are now working for Obama. That includes state Treasurer Kate Marshall, who spearheaded Clinton's efforts in Northern Nevada, and Clark County Commissioner Rory Reid, who chaired her statewide campaign. Rep. Shelley Berkley also came to Obama's side recently after having aggressively campaigned for Clinton in the run-up to the January caucuses and state Democratic conventions that followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On McCain's side of the aisle, unity has a much different look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only is the big tent party trying to oust Gov. Jim Gibbons from its three-ring circus, McCain has chosen a less-than-stable ringmaster to try to restore order. Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki, who has been the subject of a state investigation into his past performance as state treasurer, was tapped to head up McCain's Nevada campaign for the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican voters cannot be underestimated in a state that voted twice for George W. Bush, but getting someone to lead them has not been an easy task for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First of all, you need someone with good statewide name recognition who won't bring the top of the ticket down. Gibbons was obviously out, his popularity lower than that of Bush or Congress, and with voters disgusted by him becoming just another national joke: &quot;I did not have text with that woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain couldn't get Sen. John Ensign, who's still as popular as ever in Nevada. Ensign's too busy heading up GOP efforts to avoid losing more seats in the U.S. Senate this year. He has the unenviable task of defending some lackluster incumbents and having to root for some fringe candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where else could McCain turn? Rep. Dean Heller might have a statewide profile - he used to be secretary of state - but his congressional opponent's only shot this year is to turn him into a Bush/McCain clone. That would be so much easier if Heller were working for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Jon Porter's too busy fighting for his right to stay in the band to get bogged down with McCain. Besides, Porter was for Rudy Giuliani before McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Senate Majority Leader Bill Raggio of Reno is too busy angling for a fiscally conservative solution to the budget crisis on the eve of his primary race to work for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, the Straight Talk Express landed with the most roundabout talker in Nevada politics. Krolicki may have won three statewide races, but he's known more recently as the guy who likes to talk himself out of problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with so many Democrats surrounding him in the Capitol, Krolicki is like a whipping boy - in a useless office to boot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with his prime nemesis Kate Marshall now fronting for Obama, the general election dynamics will be shrill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's amazing what a few weeks will do. Once-warring Democrats are now united, and the early nomination victory by McCain still hasn't resulted in the selection of convention delegates from Nevada's GOP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a few months, we may look to this week as a turning point.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turn on the television in Las Vegas or Reno or Elko, and you'll see a presidential candidate who wants your vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's the Democrat, Barack Obama, talking about the heartland values he learned from his grandparents. There's the Republican, John McCain, talking about saving the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You don't have to settle for a commercial; you can see them in person. Obama will visit Las Vegas on Tuesday for a campaign event focused on the economy; McCain will be in town on Wednesday, opening a campaign headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no doubt Nevada is in both campaigns' sights as a top battleground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Batten down the hatches,&quot; said Jennifer Duffy, an analyst for the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter based in Washington, D.C. &quot;It's going to be a targeted state for both sides. It's going to get a whole lot of attention by the time November rolls around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts agree that Nevada could swing either way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've seen the state called everything from toss-up to a slight lean Republican from the prognosticators, but there's no scenario where anybody thinks either candidate is going to run away with the state,&quot; said Nevada Republican consultant Ryan Erwin, who's not working on the presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, President Bush won Nevada by 20,000 votes, earning 50 percent of the vote to Democratic nominee John Kerry's 48 percent. Since 1912, Nevada has voted for the winner of every presidential election, except 1976, when the state chose Republican Gerald Ford rather than Democrat Jimmy Carter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask Democrats, and they'll tell you Nevada is:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A state that's becoming more receptive to their message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A state where growth has changed the demographics, beefing up the Democratic stronghold of Clark County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A state where Western libertarianism is being tempered by suburban quality-of-life concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans, on the other hand, say Nevada remains inherently conservative, a state where residents of all political stripes favor low taxes, small government and being left alone. They say McCain, an Arizona senator with a maverick image, fits that ethos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The signs that both candidates have joined the competition for the state are abundant. McCain has situated his Western regional campaign office in Henderson. Wednesday's visit will be his third to Nevada since he captured the nomination. McCain had a town hall in Reno late last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also visited Nevada last month. Even before he captured the nomination, his campaign had a volunteer organizing event in Las Vegas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has told donors that if he carries Nevada, other Mountain West states, and possibly Virginia or Georgia, he could get the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency even if he loses Florida and Ohio, The Associated Press reported last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Review-Journal poll this month found that McCain had the support of 44 percent of Nevada voters, Obama 42 percent, with 14 percent undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategists for both campaigns are optimistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nevada voters are conservative voters: independents, Democrats and Republicans,&quot; said John Peschong, McCain regional campaign manager for the Western states. &quot;We believe John McCain is the right candidate with the right message to reach out to those folks. He's a Westerner. He understands the issues that concern them on a daily basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign senior strategist Anita Dunn said Nevada voters are looking for what Obama offers: change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama's message about the future, his message about moving past the partisan gridlock to a politics that's about solving our problems rather than finger-pointing, is something that does fit the culture of the West,&quot; she said. &quot;Senator McCain's policies increasingly resemble George Bush's. ... He's essentially lost his maverick qualities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which side wins the argument in the months ahead will depend on several factors. Here are nine questions, the answers to which, according to political analysts and the two campaigns, will determine who wins Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. What effect did the caucuses have?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats made Nevada an early state in the primary process, having caucuses right after the Iowa and New Hampshire contests. An astonishing 118,000 Nevadans participated in Democratic caucuses on Jan. 19. Republicans also had caucuses, which, while lower-key, drew 40,000 participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton won more precinct delegates on Jan. 19: 51 percent to Obama's 45 percent. But Dunn of the Obama campaign argues that what matters is both candidates mobilized volunteers and got people involved, creating a campaign infrastructure that can be built on for November while McCain starts essentially from scratch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Obama staffers left the state after the caucuses, the campaign kept its supporters mobilized for the county conventions in February and state Democratic Convention last month, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans had a primary in South Carolina on the same day as the Nevada caucus, which they mostly ignored. Mitt Romney built an organization in the state, but his lopsided win wasn't taken that seriously as the state was seen as basically uncontested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erwin, who worked for Romney in Nevada, said, &quot;The organization we built for Romney, much of that is now working for McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. What does the Democrats' voter registration advantage mean?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day of the caucus, Democrats collected 30,000 voter registration forms. The efforts of the presidential campaigns and a strong push by the party have contributed an advantage in voter registration of more than 50,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, as of four years ago, there were 10,000 more Republicans than Democrats in the state, according to the secretary of state's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 2004, Republicans represented 41 percent of the Nevada electorate, Democrats 40 percent. As of May 2008, Democrats made up 43 percent of active registered voters, while Republicans made up 38 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no question that there's a trend locally and nationally toward the Democrats and away from the Republicans,&quot; said Dan Hart, a Nevada Democratic consultant unaffiliated with the presidential campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Republicans say they would like to be on the upside of the 50,000 voter gap, some say it has more to do with the Democrats working harder to get people registered and having a more contested caucus, than with the state truly trending blue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans have to do a better job of registering voters, and I think they will, and I think they are starting to,&quot; said Republican consultant Sig Rogich, an early McCain supporter. &quot;You will start to see those numbers even out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, he said, the numbers can be misleading because Nevada has a long tradition of rural Democrats voting for Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. What role does rural Nevada play?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, rural Nevada delivered the state for Bush. Kerry got 25,000 more votes than Bush in Clark County, but with 65 percent of the rural vote, Bush pulled ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They make up only about 15 percent of the state's population, but residents of the rural counties turn out to vote much more reliably than urban voters. Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., has argued that Kerry could have won the state if he had campaigned in rural areas; he still would have lost there but by a slimmer margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're a Democrat, you don't have to carry those places; you just have to up your share of the vote outside Clark County,&quot; national analyst Duffy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the caucuses, Obama campaigned in Elko and released a platform of proposals for rural Nevada. He was stronger there than Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans have had success in the past with high turnout outside of Clark County,&quot; said Eric Herzik, a political scientist at the University of Nevada, Reno. &quot;But is McCain enough of a draw to get 80 percent in Douglas County and Elko and those kinds of places? McCain wasn't their first choice, and they still have questions about him on issues like immigration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Who will win the Hispanic vote?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain co-sponsored immigration reform legislation with Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy that would have allow some illegal immigrants to become citizens. Under fire from conservatives, McCain since has dialed back that position, saying the borders need to be secured before any other action is taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans hope McCain can make inroads with the Hispanic vote as a result. His Spanish-language radio ads, which began airing a couple of weeks ago in Nevada and New Mexico, are evidence his campaign plans to try.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He crossed party lines to work out solutions to the illegal alien problem,&quot; Rogich said. &quot;He was a statesman on that issue and that was noticed. I hear that from the Hispanic community all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nevada, Hispanics make up about 15 percent of the voting population. Exit polls from the Jan. 19 Democratic caucuses showed about 65 percent of Hispanics supported Clinton over Obama, and he is thought to have work to do to shore up their support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Hispanic vote can be the deciding factor in this campaign. It has the potential to be the deciding demographic group,&quot; Hart, the Democratic consultant, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Will Democrats be unified?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanics are just one group of Clinton supporters that Obama must bring to his side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nevada, Clinton drew on her husband's network of supporters to build support within the Democratic establishment and lock up most of the major endorsements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Clinton was an extraordinarily strong candidate,&quot; said Dunn, the Obama strategist. &quot;She always started off as the prohibitive favorite. But we are now a unified Democratic Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama built a grass-roots network outside of Clinton's institutional advantages, and now that Clinton supports Obama, he will enjoy both, Dunn said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plenty of Clinton delegates at the Democrats' convention in Reno last month swore they wouldn't vote for Obama, particularly the older women who were the bedrock of Clinton's support. National analyst Duffy noted that in the recent Review-Journal poll, Obama had less support among Democrats, 71 percent, than McCain did among Republicans, 78 percent, and speculated that might be because Clinton's supporters are still angry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Duffy and other analysts expect the Democrats to come together. &quot;It was a superficial split, and it's already beginning to heal,&quot; UNR's Herzik said. After their convention in August, &quot;you'll have a unified Democratic Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Will Republicans be unified?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herzik expects party unity to be more of a problem for McCain than Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the primaries, he said, &quot;John McCain had substantive differences with other Republicans. Obama and Clinton pretty much agreed on all the issues; McCain was for an immigration bill that a lot of other Republicans hated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain came in third in the Nevada caucuses, behind Romney and Ron Paul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peschong, the McCain regional manager, drew a parallel with the New Hampshire primary, where McCain had more than 100 town hall meetings and revived a campaign that was out of money and left for dead. Republicans, he said, just need to get to know their candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not believe he has a problem with the conservative base,&quot; he said. &quot;Senator McCain is pro-life. He supports the Second Amendment. Once we have an opportunity to talk to the base, they will support him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Will Nevada-specific issues resonate with voters?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he is a Westerner, McCain has staked out some positions that aren't popular with Nevadans. He once introduced legislation to ban betting on college sports, a major source of dollars for Las Vegas casinos, and he has been a proponent of the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's position on Yucca Mountain has seemed to soften in recent weeks as he has said he also supports an international nuclear facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, Kerry attacked Bush on the Yucca issue; Bush promised to base decisions about the dump on science, something Democrats charge he has not done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a litmus test for candidates,&quot; Hart, the Nevada Democratic consultant, said of Yucca Mountain. &quot;Unfortunately, some candidates give it lip service. They say one thing and then do another. I do think the candidate who wins has to have the right position on Yucca.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Herzik said voters have bigger things on their minds: the war and the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think anybody's going to make their choice about John McCain based on where he stands on sports betting,&quot; he said. &quot;And the people for whom Yucca Mountain is a to-die-for issue aren't going to vote for a Republican anyway. The issue that the candidates will talk about that has the biggest link to Nevada is the housing market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Who will win independent and moderate voters?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's an axiom of political science that candidates run to their base, conservative or liberal, to win primaries, then run back to the middle of the political spectrum for the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats will try hard to make John McCain the next George Bush, and the Republicans will make Barack Obama out to be a crazy liberal,&quot; said Erwin, the Nevada Republican consultant. &quot;But I believe this is a campaign that will be won on a handful of very middle-of-the-road issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Obama's early campaign TV ads send moderate messages. Obama's, titled &quot;Country I Love,&quot; talks about his grandparents from Kansas and their values. It emphasizes his work to get people off welfare and cut taxes, traditionally conservative themes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has run two TV spots. In the first, he declares, &quot;Only a fool or a fraud talks tough or romantically about war.&quot; In the second, he notes that he went against Bush on global warming, taking a stance more traditionally associated with Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're playing for the center,&quot; said Hart, the Democratic consultant. &quot;There's that huge group of people out there who don't belong to either party. In most cases, whoever appeals to them more effectively will be more successful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Who will vote?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turnout is the critical factor,&quot; UNR's Herzik said. &quot;Clark County generally has low turnout, and that's where the Democratic base is. If they can reverse that in a significant way, the chances of a Democratic victory go way up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter what the polls or the registration numbers say, what matters in November is who actually shows up to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nevada had a caucus with record turnout, but that's not very reflective of the general electorate,&quot; Duffy said. &quot;Now both sides are talking to the people that didn't participate in that process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hart agreed, citing lessons from the 2004 race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's nuts-and-bolts politics: They (the Bush campaign) identified voters and got them to the polls, especially in the rural counties,&quot; he said. &quot;Presidential elections are a matter of a few points one way or the other. You can look very good in the polls, but unless you get those people to vote, you are not going to win an election.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's new Nevada campaign chairman, Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki, said Monday that he expects the state will swing Republican in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we will be able to deliver this state into his column,&quot; Krolicki said after a McCain spokesman, Rick Gorka, announced that Krolicki had been picked to head the GOP organization in what is shaping up to be a battleground state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Bush carried Nevada in each of the last two presidential elections after ex-President Bill Clinton had won the state the two times before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In picking Krolicki, the McCain team bypassed Republican Gov. Jim Gibbons, whose first term has been marked by a headline-grabbing divorce, a growing state budget crisis and a pending corruption investigation by the FBI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krolicki said he expected Gibbons will play a role in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 47-year-old Krolicki, who was elected lieutenant governor in 2006 after two terms as state treasurer, acknowledged he supported former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in the Jan. 19 Republican caucuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was now fully backing McCain as the GOP nominee for the presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just happen to have a personal friendship with Gov. Romney,&quot; Krolicki said. &quot;But Sen. McCain is someone I've known and admired for many years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krolicki said he planned to accompany McCain when the Arizona senator visits the Las Vegas area and opens a Henderson campaign office Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama will bring his race for the White House to Nevada a day earlier with a campaign appearance planned for Tuesday in Las Vegas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates have political commercials airing in the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his new role as an election commentator for Fox News, Mike Huckabee will need to beat what he pulled the other day in Japan, where he was giving speeches for hire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference in Tokyo, Huckabee did that thing he does from time to time, which is pretend to reach for the high ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, &quot;Republicans will make a fundamental if not fatal mistake if they seek to win the election by demonizing Barack Obama.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox is going to be paying him for deeper insight and more honesty than that, one would think. Republicans have no chance other than to demonize Obama, and Huckabee well knows it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was approximately as disingenuous as that day in Iowa when Huckabee called a news conference to declare his moral objection to his own negative television commercial. He pronounced that he would not dare air this commercial, owing to his own high principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he played the ad for the assembled reporters, just so he could show them what he was too good to show them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain and the Republicans will lose if this campaign is about issues. They only mismanaged the economy and mismanaged the hurricane and mismanaged the budget and mismanaged the war and mismanaged the hunt for Osama bin Laden and mismanaged the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also will lose if the campaign comes down to a cult of personality. Obama has personality and McCain not so much. Character? Yes. Personality? Different thing. Obama draws thousands. McCain draws dozens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans will beat Obama the same way they beat Michael Dukakis and John Kerry, which is by deploying arms-length groups that give their nominee deniability while they smear the Democratic candidate and paint him as someone to be feared on account of being culturally alien to supposed mainstream American values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They desperately tried it on Bill Clinton, too, in 1992, putting out the word that Clinton ventured to Moscow on a travel visa when he was supposed to be studying as a Rhodes Scholar in England. Clinton got elected anyway, and, fortunately, his problems turned out to be of a sex-addiction rather than a commie-sympathizing variety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isn't anyone else getting these e-mails lately? Some call Obama a Muslim and terrorist sympathizer. Some call him a member of a frightful Afro-centric Christian sect that hates America. Some call him both and invite you to pick your favorite fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some cite his color and are simply racist, often with supposed humor. Some call him the son of an African deadbeat father and suggest that he has a bad gene or divided national loyalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some depict him as the son of a wildly liberal white woman and sound an alarm that he'll socialize medicine and give in to Iran and do Lord knows what else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isn't anyone else listening? You're hearing only two things these days. One is disdain for the unholy mess the Republicans have made. The other is dread that Obama may be some kind of weirdo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's your election. The Republicans hold only the one card, the weirdo card. And now Huckabee is pontificating in Japan as if holier than thou that Republicans ought to stick to higher-minded things</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some are saying, I'm sure, that Democrats do this same thing to Republicans and that Democrats demonized Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay and George W. Bush and Dick Cheney and Ken Starr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's arguable whether most of those Republican fellows just mentioned jump-started themselves toward demonizing. And we could argue, too, about the difference between demonizing someone and fomenting fear of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's not arguable that Republicans have been better at whatever you choose to call it, at least in recent presidential campaigns.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama launched his first general-election television ad in Nevada, a commercial that shows him talking about family values and patriotism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 60-second commercial is scheduled to start airing today on networks statewide, according to the campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ad, titled &quot;Country I Love,&quot; the Illinois senator addresses the camera in a home setting while acoustic guitar music plays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was raised by a single mom and my grandparents,&quot; Obama says, as snapshots from his youth are shown. &quot;We didn't have much money, but they taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland where they grew up: accountability and self-reliance, love of country, working hard without making excuses, treating your neighbor as you'd like to be treated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama emphasizes his choice after college to &quot;pass up Wall Street jobs&quot; and work as a community organizer in Chicago. He says his values were also the reason he &quot;passed laws moving people from welfare to work, cut taxes for working families and extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama closes the ad by saying, &quot;If I have the honor of taking the oath of office as president, it will be with a deep and abiding faith in the country I love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Nevada, seen as one of the top battleground states by both Obama and Republican rival John McCain, the ad is set to air in 17 other states, according to the campaign: Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has also begun airing ads in Nevada as competition heats up for the November election. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfazed by pressure from Democrats and the business community, Republicans for the second time in a week prevented the Senate from taking up a tax bill providing more than $50 billion in renewable energy credits and tax breaks for families and businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote Tuesday to move to the legislation was 52-44, eight short of the 60 votes needed. Only five Republicans voted to end the filibuster against action on the bill: others objected to the Democratic plan to pay for the tax relief by making some hedge fund managers and multinational corporations pay more taxes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opponents argued that tax relief should not be matched with what they regarded as tax increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 10, the vote to move to the bill was 50-44, 10 short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following that first vote, House Democrats delievered an ultimatum to the Senate, making clear that they would not vote to extend the dozens of expired or soon-to-expire tax breaks for businesses and families unless Congress found ways to replace lost revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and other Democratic leaders joined in with a letter to Republican leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.: &quot;If Senate Republicans continue to maintain the preposterous fiction that closing a tax loophole for multimillionaires amounts to a violation of fundamental principle, you will be denying tax relief to millions of middle-class Americans in the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McConnell, in an exchange with Reid on the Senate floor Monday, stood his ground. Republicans support the tax extensions, he said, but &quot;short-term tax extensions shouldn't be the occasion for permanent tax increases.&quot; That's akin to transforming &quot;the annual ritual of extending current law tax relief into a stealth exercise in increasing the size of government,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McConnell, whose Republican allies on the vote blocking the tax bill included Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., noted that the House version with revenue offsets, which passed last month on a 263-160 vote, engendered a presidential veto threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats in both the House and Senate are proposing to raise some $54 billion by preventing hedge fund managers and others from deferring certain overseas profits and by delaying a tax break that multinationals are slated to receive in the coming years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumed Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama was not present for the vote, but his office said he supported the bill and the measures to pay for the tax relief. &quot;We need to get back on track to honest and transparent budgeting that is fair and fiscally responsible,&quot; his press office said in a statement. Sen. John McCain, the presumed GOP nominee for the White House, also did not vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation contains some $17 billion in tax credits to help industries develop renewable energy sources including wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and plug-in electric vehicles, as well as to promote energy conservation in commercial buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The package also extends for a year the research and development tax credit, and keeps alive deductions for higher education tuition, state and local general sales taxes, teacher expenses and charitable contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month more than 300 high-tech and manufacturing companies, normally sympathetic to GOP anti-tax policies, praised the House bill and urged Congress to act quickly. They said that failure to extend the tax credits &quot;will bring investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects to a standstill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., said he planned to attach a provision shielding for a year more than 20 million taxpayers in danger of getting hit this year by the alternative minimum tax. Baucus, differing from his Democratic colleagues in the House, offered no revenue offsets for the estimated $61 billion cost of the AMT fix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last December, after a long fight, the Senate approach prevailed when Congress approved an AMT fix that was not paid for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill is H.R. 6049.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pop quiz: Why has John Cusack jumped into the political arena with a video saying John McCain is a war-profiteering clone of President George W. Bush?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know my opinion doesn't matter more than anyone else's and I just make films,&quot; he told The Associated Press in a phone interview Wednesday. &quot;But I do feel you have to speak out, and that's what I'm doing.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second video, which went out to members of the liberal political activist group MoveOn.org on Wednesday, will begin airing on television Thursday. In it, Cusack offers a &quot;pop quiz&quot; to voters, asking them among other things: &quot;Who supports keeping our troops in harm's way in Iraq but not the bipartisan G.I. bill of rights to support them when they return home?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Bush both do, Cusack says, adding, &quot;Bet you can't tell them apart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost to air the ads is $45,000. They will appear nationally on the Bravo cable channel and in Washington, D.C., on CNN, MSNBC and Comedy Central.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his latest film, the war satire &quot;War Inc.,&quot; Cusack makes no secret that he believes the Iraq war was created to profit private businesses like Blackwater Worldwide and Bechtel Corp., which hold war-related contracts worth millions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not going to pretend this thing in Iraq was some kind of free market utopia to spread the gospel of democracy through the Middle East,&quot; he told the AP from London, where he's at work on another project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cusack says he supports Democrat Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he has made such films as &quot;War Inc.&quot; and last year's &quot;Grace is Gone,&quot; in which he plays the husband of a soldier killed in Iraq, Cusack notes this has been his first high-profile foray into partisan politics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain began his first television advertising of the general election season Friday with a spot that will air in Nevada and other swing states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second commercial, titled &quot;Safe,&quot; stresses McCain's military experience. In it, the candidate talks directly to the camera, while violins keen in the background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only a fool or a fraud talks tough or romantically about war,&quot; McCain says in the ad. &quot;When I was five years old, my father left for war. My grandfather came home from war and died the next day. I was shot down over Vietnam and spent five years as a POW. Some of the friends I served with never came home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hate war, and I know how terrible its costs are. I'm running for president to keep the country I love safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., blasted the ad Friday, saying McCain's support of the war in Iraq belies the ad's message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he truly hates war, he should lay out his plan to get American troops out of Iraq quickly and safely,&quot; Reid said. &quot;If he is truly concerned about the costs associated with the war, he should end his happy talk about the state of America's economy, lay out a plan for improving it and start working with Democrats in Congress on ways to strengthen the economy for Nevada's hardworking families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said the ad will be airing statewide in Nevada, although the campaign refused to say how widely or for how long it will be shown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is airing in 10 states: Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. All are considered battlegrounds for the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain began advertising in Nevada earlier in the week with ads on Spanish-language radio. A campaign spokesman said the state will be a target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nevada is a key swing state and will be a focus of Senator McCain's campaign,&quot; Rick Gorka said. &quot;John McCain's experience (is) as a western Senator, whose maverick record of finding bipartisan solutions will be a key component of his message in 2008.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama hasn't aired ads in Nevada since the Jan. 19 caucuses. A spokeswoman said she didn't know when Obama ads would begin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nevada is a battleground state, and we plan to wage an aggressive campaign,&quot; Shannon Gilson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Nevada, Las Vegas political scientist David Damore noted that McCain has been criticized for failing to capitalize on his months-long head start, having captured his party's nomination while Obama battled Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They should have started organizing here as soon as they clinched,&quot; Damore said of the McCain camp. Instead, with Obama having built a grass-roots operation in Nevada for the caucuses, which were won by Clinton, Obama starts with an edge, Damore said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign that the Hispanic vote in the West could hold the key to the November election, Republican presumptive nominee John McCain launched his first local campaign ad, a Spanish-language radio spot, in Nevada this week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 60-second commercial touts McCain, a senator from Arizona, as a nonpartisan problem-solver on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we are buying groceries, we don't have a political party,&quot; the ad states, according to a translation provided by the campaign. &quot;When we are filling up the gas tank, we are not Republicans, Democrats or independents. We are Hispanics, and we are all hurting together in this uncertain economic time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad began airing Tuesday on Spanish-language radio stations throughout Nevada. It is airing also in New Mexico. The campaign would not give details Wednesday on how long the spot will continue to air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada and New Mexico are seen as key battlegrounds for the presidency, and both have large populations of Hispanic voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was once a champion of comprehensive immigration reform, including allowing illegal immigrants eventually to gain citizenship, but has backtracked on the issue under fire from the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's expected rival, Sen. Barack Obama, also could face problems attracting Hispanic voters, who voted overwhelmingly for Sen. Hillary Clinton in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Obama both campaigned in New Mexico and Nevada last week as they began laying the groundwork for the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Spanish ad &quot;goes to two points,&quot; McCain campaign spokesman Jeff Sadosky said. &quot;One, we feel John McCain is the type of Republican who can do very well among Hispanic voters. Two, the message of the ad ties in with a theme you will see throughout John McCain's presidential campaign: He is a candidate who throughout his career has not just given lip service to the idea of bipartisanship but has brought results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadosky said a Web ad released by the campaign for Veterans Day highlighted the &quot;disproportionate&quot; role of Hispanics in military service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By talking about economic issues, talking about the issues of service and patriotism, he's (McCain is) going to continue reaching out to Hispanics on a number of issues,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - After years of setbacks and delays, the federal government's plan to bury nuclear waste in Nevada took a significant step forward Tuesday when the Department of Energy applied for permission to build a repository at Yucca Mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A moving truck pulled up to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission at 8:40 a.m. and dropped off 15 sets of the department's construction license application. Each set consisted of 17 binders and totaled 8,647 pages, with electronic copies on DVD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The license application represents a milestone once thought out of reach for the project that was conceived more than 25 years ago to locate a resting place for 77,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel from commercial power plants and highly radioactive waste generated by the U.S. military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's application begins a new phase for the Yucca Mountain Project,&quot; Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said at a news conference. &quot;This is a filing that will put this project in a new frame of mind moving forward.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long roads still lie ahead. The project faces NRC technical reviews that are expected to take four years or more, continued fights for funding, and anticipated legal and political challenges from Nevada officials and other critics who charge the project is flawed and unsafe and will never be built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Loux, director of Nevada's Nuclear Projects Agency and a longtime opponent of the project, said the license application is so &quot;grossly deficient that a fair and unbiased NRC would reject it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Science fiction is what this is,&quot; Loux said from his office in Carson City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project chief Ward Sproat said the Yucca site could start accepting nuclear waste by 2020 at a cost of $70 billion to $80 billion under a best case scenario for DOE. Other experts think a more realistic goal might be the middle of that decade or later, if ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Energy Department officials celebrated with cookies and punch at Washington headquarters. DOE also gave workers commemorative Yucca Mountain medallions that cost $3.75 apiece for 2,000 copies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The licensing paperwork was drawn from decades of study into the geology of the mountain, 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, and a number of engineering add-ons. The project envisions storing radioactive waste in as many as 11,000 containers in a 41-mile warren of tunnels spaced 1,000 feet below the surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a lot of emotional people today because some of them didn't think they would be around long enough to see this happen,&quot; Sproat said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, the project was buffeted by an e-mail scandal, a series of deep budget cuts and management missteps. A target date of 1998 to start accepting waste at the site fell aside, as did a 2010 planned repository opening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sproat, who was installed in 2006 following a career as a nuclear industry executive, said Yucca Mountain managers &quot;have turned around a program that was known for continually missing milestones into one that has met or beat every milestone set for them two years ago despite significant budget cuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada's opposition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, DOE's application came under immediate attack Tuesday by top Nevada officials, who vowed to redouble their efforts to keep high-level nuclear waste out of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto planned to file a petition today with the NRC calling on the commission to reject the license application out of hand. Attorneys for the state have said they planned to prepare 250 to 500 challenges to be aired during license hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada officials were reviewing the application Tuesday to determine how many key elements were missing, which would provide the state with opportunities to challenge, said Marta Adams, deputy attorney general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our understanding there will be significant gaps,&quot; Adams said. &quot;We anticipate challenging the completeness of the license application.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When NRC hearing boards convene, the state, Clark County and the rural counties surrounding the site will be formal participants, with the Nuclear Energy Institute and California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Timbisha Shoshone, the affected Indian tribe in the proceedings, reacted bitterly to the license application and said in a statement from tribal Chairman Joe Kennedy that the project &quot;is moving ahead over the rights and need of the tribe to conduct our own planning, oversight and monitoring for the protection of all living things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Loux argued that the application does not contain a final design of the repository and that there is no design covering transportation, aging and disposal canisters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Energy Department &quot;relies on this 'drip shield' concept that they're not going to install for 300 years, yet they want credit for that&quot; as a barrier to retard corrosion of the canisters, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the Environmental Protection Agency has not issued a final radiation safety standard that the NRC would have to adopt and to determine whether the license application conforms to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Virtually on every front, the political, the technical and procedural fronts, this thing isn't going anywhere,&quot; Loux said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sentiment was echoed by members of Nevada's delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This latest attempt by the DOE is merely a last-ditch effort to breathe life into bad policy that is wrong for America. Yucca Mountain is dead, and it is time to move forward in a new direction with on-site waste storage,&quot; Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the application includes designs that are &quot;only 35 percent complete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document &quot;lacks critical information that cannot simply be overlooked,&quot; he said. &quot;For example, just how would the Energy Department respond in the event of an emergency? We can't answer that question because the department doesn't even know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., said the license application &quot;should be seen for exactly what it is - an $80 billion goodbye present to the nuclear industry from President Bush at the expense of the health and safety of families in Nevada and nationwide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Start the review'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials from DOE and NRC contend a license review could be started without an EPA-finalized regulation setting public health limits on radioactive materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The materials would escape from the repository over periods stretching to a million years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having an EPA standard in hand &quot;is not a requirement,&quot; Bodman said. &quot;It is certainly possible and appropriate for us to file an application prior to EPA determining the standard. Let's get the review started.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This application is a very high-quality, extremely detailed document,&quot; Bodman said. &quot;It is our collective judgment that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will conclude that this project can and will be completed in a safe and secure manner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NRC will undertake a 30-day initial review of the application for completeness, spokesman David McIntyre said. If the paperwork passes muster, the agency would formally docket the application and start in-depth safety reviews that could consume the next year and a half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada's congressional lawmakers scheduled to meet today to determine what actions to take now that the project will be under the umbrella of the NRC, which focuses on safety matters . A majority of Nevadans in polls oppose the repository on the belief it will be unsafe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada officials argue that delay has been a valuable ally against Yucca Mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As time has worn on, new thinking has raised questions about whether a repository as designed still is the best approach for the United States to manage nuclear waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some members of Congress have become interested in reprocessing nuclear fuel to draw out more energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is my belief that America needs a solution to the nuclear waste question, and I believe that reprocessing could in fact be the best way to meet our nation's needs. Nevertheless, it is important that the NRC begin work on its review process for Yucca Mountain so that all of our options remain on the table,&quot; said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., a leader on nuclear issues who is retiring this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOE expects its application will be a confidence-booster for the program and for allies in Congress who have failed to act on bills to move the project along, Sproat said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe they will be energized and very supportive now that we have actually done this,&quot; Sproat said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sproat acknowledged that with DOE applying for a license now, NRC safety reviews could be well under way by the time a new president takes office next January and that Yucca Mountain could be shielded if there is a new critic in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expected Republican nominee John McCain supports Yucca Mountain. A spokeswoman for probable Democratic nominee Barack Obama has said he would withdraw the application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sproat said a new president might find that easier said than done given a web of DOE contracts with utilities and states and lawsuits that are costing taxpayers millions of dollars in damages because the government has yet to open a waste site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Regardless of what the rhetoric is on the campaign trail, and regardless of who wins. ... I personally think they are going to say let's wait to see what the NRC does with the license application,&quot; Sproat said.</SPAN></P>
