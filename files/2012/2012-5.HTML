</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign will begin an extensive advertising campaign this week in nine battleground states, part of a broader effort by the president to frame his first term around a narrative of momentum and unfinished progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's argument to voters, summed up in the new 60-second commercial: let me finish the job. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign did not immediately release the cost of this latest ad buy but said it would be significant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial begins with a retelling of the events that led to the Great Recession, events that an announcer reminds viewers actually began before Mr. Obama took office: worst financial collapse since the Great Depression; 4.4 million jobs lost; stock market plummets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some said our best days were behind us. He believed in us. He fought for us,&quot; the announcer says before reciting a list of the president's accomplishments, like the auto industry rescue and the killing of Osama bin Laden. &quot;But we're coming back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's political strategists believe that it is important to  counter the criticism coming from Mitt Romney and Republicans that Mr. Obama had his chance to turn the country around but failed to do so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you tell the story from the other side, it's that one day the president showed up to a blank slate and now things aren't good,&quot; said Larry Grisolano, director of paid media for the Obama campaign. &quot;Having  that narrative, knowing the complete story is essential to making the right judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;David Axelrod, Douglas Schoen and other political strategists discuss how the strength of Mitt Romney's super PAC and the weakness of President Obama's will affect the election. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, before everyone gets to know him, is the time for Obama to push Romney face down in the dirt,&quot; a key Democratic operative working outside the campaign told me last week. &quot;You can't let Romney go before the voters looking clean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Obama lacks right now, however, is a bludgeon - a super PAC loaded with cash to hammer home negative advertising. Super PACs, as you may have heard, have emerged as the hit men of 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why? Because super PACs offer two key advantages that make them ideal as attack dogs: unrestrained fundraising and a little distance from the candidates they support. They can accept unlimited donations from corporations, unions and individuals, and they do not need to obtain a candidate's approval for the messages they are putting out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama-Romney election is expected to be close. Consequently, each side will try to eviscerate the other. Super PACs, and similar tax-exempt, independent-expenditure organizations - named after section&nbsp;501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code - are better equipped to finance harsh&nbsp; advertising  they are legally prohibited from coordinating with the candidate and his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign has raised a ton of money - $191.7 million as of March 31. But his super PAC, Priorities USA, had collected a paltry $8.99 million by the same date. This is chickenfeed compared to Romney's super PAC, Restore Our Future, which had raised $51.9 million as of March 31. After heavy spending to win the nomination, Restore Our Future had $6.5 million in the bank, but it has demonstrated a far greater ability to raise money than Priorities USA, and there are a host of super rich conservatives prepared to invest large sums to defeat Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Axelrod, the Obama-Biden campaign's chief strategist, is acutely aware of the problem confronting the Democratic ticket. In an e-mailed response to a Times inquiry, he wrote: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No president has ever faced the kind of onslaught we are about to see. We expect the super Pacs, and their more insidious, non-disclosing cousins - the 501c4 front groups - to spend as much as a billion dollars. They will act as a tag-team with Romney, allowing his team to carry a positive message as the super Pacs rain negative ads down on the president. To date, they have dwarfed Priorities and other Democrat-leaning efforts, so we've had to spend millions of dollars responding to super Pac attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglas Schoen, a Democratic consultant who is not part of the Obama campaign and has been very critical of the president, wrote in an email that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it is a huge, and potentially dispositive disadvantage that Obama is not raising super PAC money. I expect Romney to have $400-500 million to spend in what will ultimately prove to be 5-8 crucial swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the financial advantages, Schoen wrote, Republican super PACs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can and will run ads without disclosure or with any real review of their accuracy. So Romney can and will insulate himself from the most noxious and offensive and probably inaccurate ads as well - as he did in the primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two conservative independent groups founded by Karl Rove, American Crossroads, a super PAC, and Crossroads GPS (Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies), a 501(c)(4), are expected to act as Romney surrogates. Together they&nbsp;have raised $99.8 million, with expectations of tripling that by election day. These groups will also invest heavily on behalf of Republican candidates in House and Senate races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crossroads GPS entered the presidential campaign early, running a TV ad in July 2011 showing a woman tossing and turning at 3 a.m., unable to sleep. She says:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm worried I guess, about our jobs, our home, how everything costs more, even mom's health care. How will we ever retire? Lately I worry a lot about my kids. What's their future going to be like? I supported President Obama because he spoke so beautifully. But since then, things have gone from bad to much worse. He said spending hundreds of billions on a stimulus would create more jobs, but now all we've got is a lot more debt and more people out of work. Instead of fixing health care, my mom's Medicare will be cut and our health insurance premiums went up. Our country's got this huge debt and Obama says raise taxes and keep spending more? Doesn't Washington know we can't afford more taxes and debt? If they don't figure it out, it's going to be even tougher for our kids. There's got to be a way to take away President Obama's blank check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individual Republican donors have shelled out huge sums to super PACs. Sheldon and Miriam Adelson famously contributed $25 million. Harold Simons, C.E.O. of Contran Corp. in Dallas, has given $13.7 million, and Robert J. Perry, a homebuilder in Houston, has written checks totaling $6.6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between now and the Republican convention at the end of August is Obama's window of opportunity to paint a negative picture of Romney, but lacking super PAC funds his hands are tied. At the same time, Republican super PACs have begun to vilify Obama and portray Romney in a favorable light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Restore our Future announced plans to spend $4.3 million running a commercial called &quot;Saved&quot; in nine swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad tells the story of Romney shutting down Bain Capital and sending 50 employees to New York to recover the missing 14-year-old daughter of Robert Gay, one of Romney's partners. The ad shows Gay, his voice cracking, as he tells viewers, &quot;Mitt's done a lot of things people say are nearly impossible, but for me, the most important thing he's ever done is to help save my daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Restore Our Future goes positive, Crossroads GPS has invested $1.7 million in a negative anti-Obama ad, &quot;Too Much.&quot; The commercial - shown in April in six swing states (Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, and Virginia) accuses Obama of falsely claiming that he has increased domestic oil production and blames him for high gas prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Obama's advertising budget comes primarily from his campaign treasury, he will have to air explicitly negative anti-Romney ads himself, unable to hide behind independent expenditure committees. Negative ads run by the Democratic National Committee will provide Obama only modest cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one eight day period from April 25 to May 2, the Obama campaign released six anti-Romney web ads and one negative television ad, going after Romney on issues ranging from women's contraception to his Swiss bank account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Web ads, however, are only of marginal value. They reach relatively few voters and unless they somehow capture the public imagination and go viral, most of the people who see them are already Obama loyalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's sole television ad during this period attacked Romney for shipping jobs overseas. The ad clearly identifies the Obama-Biden campaign as the sponsor and begins with Obama himself saying &quot;I'm Barack Obama and I approved this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, the benefits of the Obama&nbsp;commercial are counteracted by the fact that voters who dislike negative ads will know Obama is sponsoring this one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, in the view of strategists on both sides, needs to take the offensive against Romney, not only to swiftly sully his opponent's name, but to divert attention from his own vulnerabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These vulnerabilities include not only a dangerously high unemployment rate of 8.1 percent, but, equally important, median annual household income that has effectively stagnated for two years at $2,500 below where it was when Obama was sworn into office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when jobs and economic growth override all other election issues, Obama's opposition to the construction of the 1,179-mile Keystone XL pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta to Steele City, Neb., has provided Republicans with another inviting target: a Democratic president more beholden to environmentalists than to the thousands of pipeline workers who would be hired to build the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Republicans and the Romney campaign have their way, the Keystone XL pipeline will become a metaphor for Democratic environmental elitism, a tactic which may well prove effective in building support among white working class voters, now a core Republican constituency. (Romney, of course, has his own problems with elitism.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's vulnerability on unemployment and the economy is evident in the findings of a Washington Post poll from April 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While voters said Obama would do better than Romney in &quot;protecting the middle class&quot; by 49-39 and in &quot;addressing women's issues&quot; 53-34, Romney won on &quot;handling the economy&quot; 47-43, &quot;handling energy policy&quot; 47-42 and &quot;handling the federal budget deficit&quot; 51-38. Perhaps most significantly, on a question that traditionally favors Democrats - &quot;creating jobs&quot; - Obama holds only a slim 46-43 advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the struggle during the next six months will be over setting the campaign agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the chart below shows, an election campaign dominated by the deficit, illegal immigration and &quot;dealing with moral breakdown&quot; decisively favors Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, an election conducted primarily on issues like education, the environment, helping the poor, making the tax system fairer and preserving Medicare tilts the debate in favor of Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The test of Obama's strength has already begun in earnest. In Western Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, American Crossroads is running a $175,000 radio campaign quoting Cecil Roberts, the president of the United Mine Workers, charging that new federal regulations on the coal industry are &quot;a job killer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The careful targeting of this ad to coal-mining areas, and the use of a cheaper medium, radio, reflects the strategy used by both Romney and Obama supporters of identifying &quot;niche&quot; issues of importance to relatively small, but important segments of the electorate in the nine to fourteen states that will hold the balance of power in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of these tactics assume the election will be close. Neither candidate will have the wind at his back, as Obama did in 2008. Any major shift in the economy, for better or worse - including the possible domestic repercussions of a renewed European financial crisis - could trump these tactical maneuvers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Absent such a development, the candidate who proves best equipped to bludgeon his opponent and protect his own image - in a campaign expected to be the most expensive in history - will likely emerge the victor on Nov. 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of Democratic strategists contend, on background, that Obama created his own problem in raising super PAC money by aggressively keeping both lobbyists and major donors at arm's length during his tenure in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schoen, one of the few Democrats willing to speak on the record, put it this way:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's problems are two-fold. There has been no donor maintenance, and there has been no effort to cultivate bundlers like Clinton and Bush did. I'm not sure it is reformist policies, but rather a singular disregard for the exigencies of modern day politics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Obama walks into the Roosevelt Room of the White House and takes his seat around a table. The West Wing, as on most Sunday evenings, is quiet except for the tight circle of advisers who gather for a confidential briefing on his re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gathering often takes place after Mr. Obama's regular Sunday round of golf, and while the atmosphere is casual, the agenda is anything but: keeping the president immersed in what it will take to win a second term. He receives an update on how his operation is expanding in battleground states, he watches previews of television ads and he studies a presentation on his various paths to victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These previously undisclosed sessions, which take place nearly every other week just across the hall from the Oval Office, are designed to bridge a divide between his campaign headquarters in Chicago and his aides in Washington in preparing for what Mr. Obama and his team anticipate will be a grueling race against Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cast of top advisers -- a group limited to 10 in hopes of streamlining the meetings -- offers a revealing look at the pecking order of the hierarchy in the Obama campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. nor any other cabinet members are on hand. Instead, the room is filled with a group of trusted confidants who were at Mr. Obama's side during the last campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attendance roster, which was confirmed by multiple people familiar with the list, reveals a mix of White House staff, including David Plouffe, a senior adviser and campaign manager from 2008; Jacob J. Lew, the chief of staff; Valerie Jarrett and Pete Rouse, senior advisers; Dan Pfeiffer, the communications director; and Alyssa Mastromonaco, a deputy chief of staff who has worked for Mr. Obama since his days in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign team includes Jim Messina, the campaign manager, who sets the agenda for the meeting; David Axelrod, a senior strategist; Stephanie Cutter, a deputy campaign manager; and Larry Grisolano, a top political adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president, who is set to open his re-election campaign formally on Saturday with back-to-back rallies in Ohio and Virginia, has been preparing to run against Mr. Romney since well before the Republican nomination was settled. Mr. Obama has been studying the statements and record of his opponent -- particularly on the Massachusetts health care law, a model for the national law -- and is well on his way to becoming a student of Mr. Romney's positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, who three years ago became the first president to demand a BlackBerry to keep in touch with the outside world, has now become the first sitting president to rely on an iPad to stay informed. He watches campaign commercials, offering his seal of approval to the first wave of advertisements to be used against Mr. Romney, and he follows his rival through newspaper articles and blogs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president has already made clear that he is well acquainted with Mr. Romney's views. At a news conference this week, Mr. Obama urged people to ''take a look'' at his opponent. He reprised a comment by Mr. Romney in 2007 when he said he would not invade a country to capture or kill Osama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I said that I'd go after Bin Laden if we had a clear shot at him,'' Mr. Obama said, ''and I did.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If running for president the first time is a full-time job, running for re-election is a bit like moonlighting. For all the planning that Mr. Obama's team employs, uncertainties like the jobs report on Friday mornings often end up driving the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, some presidents are more political than others. Mr. Obama is intensely competitive, but far from obsessive about politics in the way that former President Bill Clinton is. Mr. Obama's approach is closer to that of former President George W. Bush, who assumed a bird's-eye view of his re-election bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a contest increasingly guided by factors beyond the direct control of either candidate, Mr. Obama has gradually increased the attention he has devoted to the race. Yet aides say he still spends far more time on his iPad checking scores on ESPN than obsessively reading up on Mr. Romney, or digging into the weeds of his own polls or campaign metrics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sunday meeting, which participants have sworn to keep secret, was devised by his advisers to help Mr. Obama begin focusing on his re-election bid. The time is intentionally carved out to discuss big-picture themes that the president will use to challenge Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They have a candidate now, and the president is certainly paying more attention to that candidate, his arguments and his record and approach,'' said Mr. Axelrod, a senior adviser, whose cellphone rings with increasing frequency, with the president on the line hoping to talk about the campaign. ''He's homing in on the race, but unlike the other guy, he has a day job, and that is still where the bulk of his attention has to be.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has told associates that he is aware of the precariousness of the political environment for him. He asks aides about his campaign message. He craves the bullet-point summaries of polls, but he does not delve into the fine print of surveys or other campaign research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say he is intensely motivated to win not only because of his personal legacy and the historic nature of his presidency. He also sees a second term as essential, they said, to ensuring that key policies like his national health care law, which could be overthrown by the Supreme Court, are not wiped from the books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Every election is the most important election in our history,'' Mr. Obama said the other night at a fund-raising event, offering a window into his campaign message. ''But let me tell you, this one matters. This one matters. This one matters.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president will make his case against Mr. Romney on Saturday more forcefully than he has, aides said, hoping to define his opponent before the fall campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has met Mr. Romney only once -- they shared the stage at a 2004 Gridiron dinner in Washington -- and he has told friends that he respects Mr. Romney's intellect, but bristles at his view of government and economic fairness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When their paths crossed eight years ago, Mr. Obama playfully mocked Mr. Romney and encouraged him to ''go for it.'' He reflected on the losing presidential campaign of Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and jabbed Mr. Romney, ''I hear that Massachusetts is a great launching pad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rallies for the president on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio, and Richmond, Va., are expected to help capture the enthusiasm of students before the summer begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign aides will register volunteers with iPads, and keep their information for the fall campaign. Aides said more than 48,000 people signed up by text message to win ''Backstage with Barack'' passes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six months before Election Day, Mr. Obama waxes nostalgic at the events of his presidency. He seldom talks about the Nobel Peace Prize he was awarded. The oil spill along the Gulf Coast -- once described as his Hurricane Katrina -- is rarely mentioned. But he warns Democrats that the trials of his first term are about to be unspooled in a bare-knuckle campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's nothing more humbling, actually, than being president,'' Mr. Obama said the other day at a fund-raiser, where his words almost lapsed into past tense as he stood beside Mr. Clinton and talked about Air Force One. ''It's a great plane, and I'll miss it, too!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''But not yet!'' a supporter shouted from the audience, trying to buck him up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As applause rose from the crowd, Mr. Obama paused and declared, ''But not yet!''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's reelection bid formally kicks off Saturday with events in Ohio and Virginia, after a week of events that largely were geared toward, well, Obama's reelection bid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president and first lady Michelle Obama are scheduled to hold a 1:25 p.m. rally at Ohio State University followed by a 4:35 p.m. rally at Virginia Commonwealth University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio and Virginia are among the swing states expected to be hotly contested by the Obama and Mitt Romney campaigns this fall, and Obama has been maintaining a steady schedule of trips to both states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since his inauguration in January 2009, Obama has visited Ohio 20 separate times, including four times this year, according to the Washington Post's POTUS Tracker. Obama visited Virginia 66 times in the same period, including five visits this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has criticized Obama's time on the trail, arguing late last month that &quot;his campaign ought to be reimbursing the Treasury&quot; for his three-state swing to college campuses last week to urge Congress to pass an extension of current federal student loan rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, it's worth noting that members of Congress spend their fair share of time on the trail, too - the House is scheduled to be in session only 109 of 261 weekdays this year, and the Senate is expected to meet for only 22 of the first 36 weeks of the year. Both chambers are in recess this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Saturday's events mark the formal beginning of the general election, the past week has been a particularly active one for the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 27, the campaign launched a Web video suggesting that a President Mitt Romney would not have killed Osama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a campaign event Sunday night headlined by Obama and former president Bill Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the Obama campaign released a Web video unveiling its new slogan, &quot;Forward.&quot; There was the campaign's Tuesday release of a new TV spot blasting Romney for having had a Swiss bank account - an ad unveiled on the same day that Obama made a surprise visit to Afghanistan on the one-year anniversary of bin Laden's death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, as Newt Gingrich exited the GOP race, the campaign marked the occasion with a Web video reminding voters of the former House speaker's attacks against Romney. later Wednesday, Obama attended back-to-back fundraisers at the W Hotel in Washington. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday brought the release of the Web slideshow &quot;Life of Julia.&quot; And on Friday, Obama held a roundtable with students at Washington-Lee High School followed by a speech on &quot;the importance of having a fair shot at an affordable higher education.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, Saturday's events may mark a &quot;kickoff&quot; of sorts, but it's worth bearing in mind that in the run-up, the Obama campaign hasn't exactly been sitting around twiddling its thumbs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 20 years ago, a multimillion-dollar ad campaign created a fictional couple - ''Harry and Louise'' - to dramatize the dangers of President Bill Clinton's health care reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, President Obama is trying to use the same Madison Avenue-style technique to demonstrate how his policies would be better for women than would Mitt Romney's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign has invented ''Julia,'' a fictional woman whose life is chronicled in a slick infographic published on the campaign's Web site on Thursday. Visitors to the site can watch as Julia grows up, receiving benefits from the president's policies along the way. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At age 3, Julia is enrolled in Head Start programs, thanks to Mr. Obama. By 22, she's covered by her parents' health care because of Mr. Obama's health reforms. At 42, she's getting a small-business loan from the government. When she reaches 67, she's retired and drawing Social Security benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the campaign hoped to put a personal face on the president's accomplishments, it has also managed to provoke a fury among conservatives, who took to Twitter to mock Julia and to condemn the implication that the fictional young woman should be dependent on government policies throughout her life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within moments of being posted online, the #Julia hashtag began trending on Twitter. The bulk of the comments came from people who expressed outrage the depiction of Julia's life, like the conservative pundit Michelle Malkin:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hi @BarackObama. I will read Life of #Julia to my kids to show them how NOT to live their lives -- tethered to Nanny State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin)3 May 12</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One person posted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in college, #Julia cannot drive her Volt b/c BHO has eliminated all coal fired electrical plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- TipOfTheSpear (@CHOWSTL)3 May 12</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under President Romney 3yr old #Julia can afford to choose to stay home with her mommy because her daddy has a good job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Shelli Roberts (@WVShelli)3 May 12</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The graphic - titled ''The Life of Julia'' - includes criticism of Mr. Romney's positions. At each stage of life, the slide show suggests that Julia would be worse off if Mr. Romney were in charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Under the Romney/Ryan budget, interest rates on federal student loans would be allowed to double, affecting Julia and 7.4 million other students,'' the graphic says when Julia turns 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's advisers are clearly hoping that the idea of Julia will capture the public's imagination the way the Harry and Louise ads did two decades ago. The story of the fictional couple worrying about their health care helped crystallize opposition to Mr. Clinton's proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kara Carscaden, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said ''Julia'' shows women ''the clear contrast between the President's and Mitt Romney's visions.'' She said the graphic will help voters understand those differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This week, Mitt Romney said that when people ask him what he'll do for the economy, he would 'look at what the President's done, and do the opposite,' '' Ms. Carscaden said. ''Now, voters can see exactly what Romney means and the impact that would have on women.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not clear that Mr. Obama's effort will have as much effect. In 1993 and 1994, the health insurance group that broadcast the Harry and Louise ads spent millions of dollars to run them on television. So far, Julia lives only on an Internet page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Julia could backfire on Mr. Obama if voters get the impression that the president has to invent characters who are benefiting from his policies because he can't find real people to portray the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Mr. Romney assailed the Julia graphic as evidence that Mr. Obama's policies had failed women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Each night, too many women go to sleep wondering if they can pay the mortgage, if they can afford to put food on the table, and if their children will have a job after graduating from college,'' said Amanda Henneberg, the spokeswoman. ''They deserve a president who will focus on getting America back on track.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's supporters on Twitter praised the idea, calling it a creative way to explain the impact of the policy debate in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those posts on Twitter were largely overwhelmed by the sarcastic ones from Mr. Obama's critics:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under @BarackObama's policies, #Julia's dependent on gov welfare from cradle to, well, age 67. Then death panels decide http://t.co/FTicu09g</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Within hours of President Obama introducing a new campaign narrative, Republicans urge their supporters to take to Twitter with messages mocking it. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a time when a challenger like Mitt Romney could afford to sit back and wait to see whether a new message from an incumbent president would take hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not any more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Twitter-fueled news cycle has been compressed to the point that political campaigns and their supporters are forced to respond in nearly real-time. And Mr. Romney's campaign is no exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened on Thursday was a good example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's unveiled his latest attempt to undermine Mr. Romney's support among women by inventing a fictional character dubbed &quot;Julia.&quot; His campaign posted an interactive timeline on its Web site showing how her life would be affected with either man in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours, the Republican response machine was up and churning on Mr. Romney's behalf - determined not to let &quot;Julia&quot; become an effective tool for Mr. Obama's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An e-mail from the Republican National Committee urged conservatives to use the Twitter hashtag #Julia to mock the timeline. And mock they did. Throughout the day, Twitter was filled with sarcastic messages that described &quot;Julia&quot; as a ward of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quick, crowdsourced response may or may not work. But it's evidence of a growing belief in the Republican campaign and among its allies that they can't wait long before hitting back against any attempt to set a narrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just days after Mr. Obama's campaign started airing a new television commercial with the theme &quot;Forward,&quot; a &quot;super PAC&quot; designed to help elect Mr. Romney began airing one called &quot;Backwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ad, by American Crossroads, asks: &quot;Under President Obama, is America moving forward or backward?&quot; Of course, the ad answers the question in the negative: &quot;The only thing moving forward under Barack Obama? Our national debt, up $5 trillion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of that ad, it took a matter of days to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Twitter has become the clearest example of how campaign messages are delivered, and responded to, almost instantly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. Obama started using the phrase &quot;We Can't Wait&quot; during speeches to prod the Congress into acting on his jobs bills, the Republicans used the hashtag #WeCantWait to generate thousands of snarky responses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;#WeCantWait to make @BarackObama a one-term president&quot; tweeted Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;#WeCantWait for Senate Democrats to approve more than a dozen House-passed bills #4jobs j.mp/o8BTFZ #Forgotten15,&quot; tweeted John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that year, when the White House was pushing for an extension in the payroll tax cut, they argued that the extension would mean an extra $40 in the pockets of the average family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communications aides for the president urged supporters to post on Twitter what they could buy for $40, a request that was eagerly accepted by thousands of the president's faithful supporters, and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just as quickly, Republicans in Washington urged their supporters to seize the hashtag and respond in kind. And several months later, Republicans used the same Twitter approach to push back against Mr. Obama's State of the Union address in real-time, with the hashtag #100days - referring to the amount of time without a Democratic budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign seems eager to get his narratives out in an effort to define the race and his opponent. In the last week, the Democratic campaign has spared little effort in that respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Romney's advisers seem just as eager to push back as quickly as the technology will allow. Together, it suggests a fast-paced, six-month campaign filled with an intense - and unyielding - back-and-forth from both sides.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&quot;We should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created per month,&quot; Mr. Romney said. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney seized on the tepid jobs report Friday morning as &quot;very, very disappointing&quot; news and proof that President Obama is presiding over an anemic economic recovery that is happening more slowly than it should.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on Fox News just moments after the government reported that the economy added 115,000 jobs, Mr. Romney said growth should be triple that amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created per month,&quot; Mr. Romney said. &quot;This is way, way, way off from what should happen in a normal recovery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central message of Mr. Romney's campaign is that Mr. Obama's policies have blocked a robust economic recovery, prevented small businesses from expanding and caused pain for millions of people who are unable to find work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has had to adapt his message as the economic recovery began to pick up some steam over the last year. But in the face of a slowly dropping unemployment rate - the government said it stands at 8.1 percent - Mr. Romney has focused on the pace of the recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly the American people are wondering why this recovery isn't happening faster, why it's taking years and years for the recovery to occur,&quot; Mr. Romney said. &quot;And we seem to be slowing down not speeding up. This is not progress. This is very, very disappointing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney has mocked the president on the campaign trail for months by citing the fact that the unemployment rate has remained above 8 percent for most of Mr. Obama's presidency. As it approaches that rate, he points to the number of people who have stopped looking for work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason that you're seeing the unemployment rate going down is because you had more people dropping out of the work force than you had getting jobs,&quot; Mr. Romney said on Fox News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the jobs numbers were announced, Mr. Romney offered a fuller critique of the president's economic policies in an open letter to Mr. Obama published in the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper Friday morning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the letter, Mr. Romney welcomed Mr. Obama to the state ahead of a campaign rally the president is holding in Columbus on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a simple question for you,&quot; Mr. Romney wrote. &quot;Where are the jobs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney accused the president of being &quot;out of your depth&quot; when it comes to economic matters. And he chastised the president for making promises during his campaign four years ago that he has not kept while in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. President, your promises now ring hollow. If you have brought new ideas to Ohio for creating jobs, why have you waited three years to unveil them?&quot; he wrote. &quot;Have you suddenly had a revelation, or is it because 2012 is an election year?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PITTSBURGH - Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum met Friday morning in Pittsburgh before Mr. Romney's campaign event here, their first private meeting since Mr. Santorum dropped out of the Republican primary last month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though aides to Mr. Santorum said that Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, does not plan to formally endorse Mr. Romney on Friday, he will offer a basic message of support: &quot;Congratulations - now tell me what I can do to help you beat President Obama.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An aide to Mr. Santorum also said that Mr. Santorum does not plan to ask Mr. Romney for any assurances - about his positions on social issues, help to retire his campaign debt or a post in a potential Romney White House. The aide added that Mr. Santorum is a political operative at heart, who understands that the spoils go the victor, and that Mr. Romney is now his party's presumptive nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Mr. Santorum endorsed Mr. Romney in 2008, the two were often at odds during the 2012 campaign, in which Mr. Santorum eventually emerged as Mr. Romney's main obstacle in securing his party's nomination. In March, Mr. Santorum said, &quot;If Mitt Romney is an economic heavyweight, we're in trouble,&quot; citing Massachusetts's poor job creation record - 47th out of 50 - when Mr. Romney was the state's governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic National Committee has already pounced on Mr. Santorum's critical remarks, blasting them out in e-mails to reporters, and releasing a video compilation of some of Mr. Santorum's statements attacking Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama leads former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in Virginia, but voters in the commonwealth are evenly divided on the White House's major policies, a new Washington Post poll shows. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is ahead of the presumed Republican presidential nominee by 51 percent to 44 percent among registered voters. And Romney does no better against Obama than he did in a Post poll a year ago, despite his emergence as the GOP standard-bearer.           The Democratic president has a key advantage in his bid for reelection: The coalition of Virginians that helped propel him to victory in 2008 - young voters, suburban Washingtonians, women and African Americans - is largely intact. Yet the survey shows that voters in the state are split on Obama's signature health-care reform law and that they remain deeply pessimistic about the way things are going in the country, creating a potential opening for Romney.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia's changing electorate and Obama's 2008 win suggested that the Old Dominion is becoming a reliably swing state. But Republicans have spent the intervening years mounting a rebuttal, winning the governor's mansion in 2009, three more congressional seats in 2010 and control of the state Senate in 2011. The commonwealth is expected to be a battleground state in November's presidential election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christianne Rutan, a Prince William County Democrat who is African American and voted for Obama four years ago, said the president will receive her support again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No question, I would stick with Obama,&quot; said Rutan, 22, a mother of two who is a therapeutic recreational assistant at a nursing home. &quot;I think he's doing an amazing job. He doesn't get the credit that he deserves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By a whopping 97 percent to 1 percent, Obama thumps Romney among black voters, and he has a wide lead among women: 56 percent to 38 percent. Obama's up by better than a 2-to-1 ratio among those ages 18 to 29, but he faces a challenge among that group in the coming months. Many of them - 34 percent in this poll - are not registered to vote at their current addresses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was the first Democrat to capture Virginia in four decades, and this week's schedule indicates his desire to repeat that performance. He will be in Arlington on Friday to hold a roundtable and deliver remarks on student-loan debt. He will return a day later in the guise of a candidate, holding a rally in Richmond meant to mark the official start of his reelection campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Romney held an event on small business in Chantilly on Wednesday, took in more than $2 million at a Pentagon City fundraiser Wednesday night and made another jobs-focused stop in Portsmouth on Thursday, part of his broader argument that Obama's policies have stifled the economy. The candidate also plans to deliver the commencement address at Liberty University in Lynchburg on May 12.          The state has been a magnet for outside ad spending, both in the presidential contest and in the marquee U.S. Senate race that is likely to feature former governors Timothy M. Kaine (D) and George Allen (R). Many of the attacks on Obama and Kaine have focused on the president's health-care law. Yet that issue is a wash in the new poll, with supporters and opponents tied at 47 percent among registered voters - making the legislation slightly more popular than it was a year ago.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginians are split down the middle on the administration's major policies overall, but tend to credit Obama with doing a good job. The president has a 53 percent approval rating, while 44 percent disapprove (it's a narrower 50 to 47 among registered voters). Republicans in Congress fare less well, with 60 percent of respondents saying they were dissatisfied with or angry about the policies of the congressional GOP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia Beach resident Philip Read, 45, who lost his public relations job eight months ago when his company closed, said he is leaning toward voting for Obama but is not &quot;enthusiastic.&quot; He said he supported Obama in 2008 but thinks the president has not done a good enough job on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What happened with Mr. Obama is that he worked to get Obamacare at any cost that he lost sight of the economy,&quot; said Read, who is an independent. &quot;That looms large in people's minds. He didn't completely tackle that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read said Romney needs to show what he can do to improve the economy to get his vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candace Swartz, 41, a Republican from Warren County, said she will vote for Romney. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be honest, I'm not really great about any politicians right now,&quot; said Swartz, who works as a quality coordinator for Kraft Foods. &quot;But Mitt Romney seems to be the best one between the two. . . . A lot of it's the economy, a lot of it is just [Obama's] general policies. I don't believe in the health care, Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made early investments in the state, and now has 13 offices open and dozens of paid staff members. Virginia Republicans have seven field offices that will be used to boost Romney as well as other party candidates, and the Romney campaign announced Thursday that Sara Craig, Romney's state director during the Iowa caucuses, will run his Virginia operations.Romney has not been able to improve his statewide support from a poll a year ago even as his GOP primary opponents have fallen by the wayside. Yet he leads Obama by a huge margin among Republicans, just as Obama holds a major lead among Democrats. The key to the president's overall edge can be found in the middle of the spectrum. He has an advantage among independents, and a 23-point lead among self-described moderates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if Romney hopes to increase his chances in Virginia, choosing Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) as his running mate may not do the trick. More than two-thirds of voters say adding McDonnell to the ticket wouldn't make much difference in their choice, 11 percent say it would make them more likely to back the Republican ticket, and 19 percent say it would push them toward Obama's side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in the past several statewide elections, the outer suburbs of Washington are among the state's most competitive battlegrounds - Romney and Obama are essentially tied in the ring that includes Loudoun, Prince William and Fauquier counties. They also are neck and neck in and around Richmond. Obama runs up the score with wide leads in the inner D.C. suburbs and the Tidewater area. Romney's strength is in central and western Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's voters may want change, but the desired direction is far less clear than it was before the 2008 election. In the summer of 2007, nearly two-thirds said they were dissatisfied with or angry at the George W. Bush administration; far fewer now say so of Obama's. More now say they're unhappy with Republicans in Congress than the executive branch. And although 83 percent of voters four years ago said they thought the country was on the &quot;wrong track,&quot; that number now sits at 65 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll was conducted by telephone April 28 to May 2 among a random sample of 1,101 Virginia adults, including 964 registered voters and users of both conventional and cellular phones. Results from the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was the first Democrat to capture Virginia in four decades, and http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/obama-will-speak-to-students-in-arlington-friday/2012/05/02/gIQAD7EuwT_blog.html-URL-this week's schedule indicates his desire to repeat that performance. He will be in Arlington on Friday to hold a roundtable and deliver remarks on student-loan debt. He will return a day later in the guise of a candidate, holding a rally in Richmond meant to mark the official start of his reelection campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Romney held an event on small business in Chantilly on Wednesday, took in more than $2 million at http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/romney-fundraiser-draws-virginia-dignitaries-raises-600000/2012/05/03/gIQAPWGPyT_blog.html-URL-a Pentagon City fundraiser Wednesday night and made another jobs-focused stop in Portsmouth on Thursday, part of his broader argument that Obama's policies have stifled the economy. The candidate also plans to deliver the commencement address at Liberty University in Lynchburg on May 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state has been a magnet for http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/crossroads-gps-virginia-ad-hits-obama-on-gas-prices/2012/04/10/gIQAZGsw8S_blog.html-URL-outside ad spending, both in the presidential contest and in the marquee U.S. Senate race that is likely to feature former governors Timothy M. Kaine (D) and George Allen (R). Many of the attacks on Obama and Kaine have focused on the president's health-care law. Yet that issue is a wash in the new poll, with supporters and opponents tied at 47 percent among registered voters - making the legislation slightly more popular than it was a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginians are split down the middle on the administration's major policies overall, but tend to credit Obama with doing a good job. The president has a 53 percent approval rating, while 44 percent disapprove (it's a narrower 50 to 47 among registered voters). Republicans in Congress fare less well, with 60 percent of respondents saying they were dissatisfied with or angry about the policies of the congressional GOP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia Beach resident Philip Read, 45, who lost his public relations job eight months ago when his company closed, said he is leaning toward voting for Obama but is not &quot;enthusiastic.&quot; He said he supported Obama in 2008 but thinks the president has not done a good enough job on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What happened with Mr. Obama is that he worked to get Obamacare at any cost that he lost sight of the economy,&quot; said Read, who is an independent. &quot;That looms large in people's minds. He didn't completely tackle that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read said Romney needs to show what he can do to improve the economy to get his vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candace Swartz, 41, a Republican from Warren County, said she will vote for Romney. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be honest, I'm not really great about any politicians right now,&quot; said Swartz, who works as a quality coordinator for Kraft Foods. &quot;But Mitt Romney seems to be the best one between the two. . . . A lot of it's the economy, a lot of it is just [Obama's] general policies. I don't believe in the health care, Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made early investments in the state, and now has 13 offices open and dozens of paid staff members. Virginia Republicans have seven field offices that will be used to boost Romney as well as other party candidates, and the Romney campaign http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/romneys-campaign-hires-virginia-director-sara-craig/2012/05/03/gIQAOamKzT_blog.html-URL-announced Thursday that Sara Craig, Romney's state director during the Iowa caucuses, will run his Virginia operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has not been able to improve his statewide support from a poll a year ago even as his GOP primary opponents have fallen by the wayside. Yet he leads Obama by a huge margin among Republicans, just as Obama holds a major lead among Democrats. The key to the president's overall edge can be found in the middle of the spectrum. He has an advantage among independents, and a 23-point lead among self-described moderates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if Romney hopes to increase his chances in Virginia, choosing Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) as his running mate may not do the trick. More than two-thirds of voters say adding McDonnell to the ticket wouldn't make much difference in their choice, 11 percent say it would make them more likely to back the Republican ticket, and 19 percent say it would push them toward Obama's side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in the past several statewide elections, the outer suburbs of Washington are among the state's most competitive battlegrounds - Romney and Obama are essentially tied in the ring that includes Loudoun, Prince William and Fauquier counties. They also are neck and neck in and around Richmond. Obama runs up the score with wide leads in the inner D.C. suburbs and the Tidewater area. Romney's strength is in central and western Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's voters may want change, but the desired direction is far less clear than it was before the 2008 election. In the summer of 2007, nearly two-thirds said they were dissatisfied with or angry at the George W. Bush administration; far fewer now say so of Obama's. More now say they're unhappy with Republicans in Congress than the executive branch. And although 83 percent of voters four years ago said they thought the country was on the &quot;wrong track,&quot; that number now sits at 65 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll was conducted by telephone April 28 to May 2 among a random sample of 1,101 Virginia adults, including 964 registered voters and users of both conventional and cellular phones. Results from the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">813 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's talk about the Senate races. It's a matter of mental health. We cannot spend the next six months fixating on Romney versus Obama. Before you know it, we'll be so bored that we'll start arguing about whether it's seemly for the president to brag about killing Osama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Senate campaigns you at least learn new things. Such as ... </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONTANA Did you know that Billings is known as the Magic City? According to the Billings Web site, this is because ''it seemingly grew overnight into the largest distribution center in Montana.'' You have to love that kind of factoid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subject came up in a story about Congressman Denny Rehberg, the Republican candidate for Senate, who filed a negligence suit claiming the Billings Fire Department failed to control a wildfire that burned some land he was planning to develop. Rehberg dropped the case, but not before it set back the Magic City about $21,000 in legal fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People, if you are planning a career in politics, please be careful who you sue. Also, watch what you post on Facebook. And never tweet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I digress. On the Democratic side, the incumbent, Jon Tester, is running an ad titled ''Jon Tester: Montana Beef -- Montana Proud,'' which shows how the senator ''packs his own Montana beef in his roller-cooler when traveling between Montana and the Senate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tester is one of the most endangered incumbents, because of Montana's current redness. On the plus side, he never sued any home-state cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NORTH DAKOTA Rick Berg, North Dakota's congressman, opened his campaign for Senate with an ad in which his mom assures voters that Rick was raised right and will legislate ''the North Dakota way.'' Have you ever noticed that politicians are the only ones who ever say things like ''That's the North Dakota way'' or ''I'm Montana proud?'' Some people identify with their town or city, and I did see an episode of ''The Amazing Race'' in which a guy from Kentucky claimed he was running for his county, which I found pretty unusual. But generally, you don't notice all that much state-consciousness outside of Texas, except during election seasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats fought back with an ad saying the Republican House budget was not ''the way we do things in North Dakota.'' A Berg supporter retaliated by buying a radio ad claiming that a vote for the Democratic candidate, Heidi Heitkamp, would be a ''vote for Obama socialism,'' and referring to her as ''Heidi-ho.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heitkamp supporters then questioned whether the friends of Berg were trying to suggest that she was a prostitute. Already we can see that this is going to be a seriously action-packed race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MASSACHUSETTS The hottest Senate race in the country is currently the one between the Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown and his challenger, Elizabeth Warren. Right now the big issue involves whether Warren, who could be one-32nd Cherokee, did anything wrong when she listed herself as a member of a minority group in a legal directory. ''Professor Warren needs to come clean about her motivations for making these claims,'' said a Brown spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several thoughts arise, including (a) one-32nd really does not seem like a lot and (b) any controversy in which the accusing side demands that an opponent ''come clean about her motivations'' is not going to go very far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm sure this will blow over soon and we can get back to debating whether the pickup truck that Brown famously drove in his working-class-guy campaign to win the old Ted Kennedy seat was originally purchased to tow the family show horse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDIANA Next Tuesday we will learn whether Richard Lugar, a Republican, wins renomination for the Senate seat he has held for almost 36 years. This is the guy who won international renown for his work against nuclear proliferation. If he loses, the Tea Party will have claimed another victim, terrifying the remaining moderate Republican in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His opponent, Richard Mourdock, the state treasurer, claims that Lugar has become a creature of Washington. Generally, these lost-touch-with-the-people campaigns are bogus. But it does seem peculiar that Lugar's 2012 Indiana voting address was a house he sold in 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lugar, who has a home in the Washington suburbs, says he can't afford a place in Indiana too. This is a guy who represents a state where the median price of a house in Gas City is $88,000. Also, Lugar owns a family farm outside Indianapolis, but apparently there is no family house on the family farm. Personally, I'd have gone for the family shed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, here is our question: Would you rather see Lugar win, striking a blow for moderate-although-actually-pretty-darned-conservative-but-just-not-crazy Republicanism? Or would you prefer to see him lose and give the Democrats a chance to pick up an unexpected seat? Feel free to choose. It's like the basketball playoffs. Every team has its good points. Except, of course, the Miami Heat.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">904 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6:05 p.m. Updated Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday defended her decision to identify herself as a minority in a directory of law professors in the 1980s and '90s, saying that she hoped it would help her ''meet more people who had grown up like I had grown up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking questions after an event in Braintree, Mass. -- and speaking publicly about the controversy for the first time since Friday, when The Boston Herald first wrote about it -- Ms. Warren also responded forcefully to allegations from her Republican opponent, Senator Scott P. Brown, that she had claimed American-Indian ancestry to advance her academic career. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I am a hard-working teacher, I have won teaching awards, I've written books that have won acclaim,'' Ms. Warren said. ''I applied for one job in 1978 by letter, and every job I've had since then has been from someone who recruited me into that job. And they've come to me and said - and they have now said publicly - 'Because of your work, we'd like you to come here.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The only one, as I understand it, who's raising any question about whether or not I was qualified for my job is Scott Brown,'' Ms. Warren continued. ''Frankly, I'm a little shocked to hear anybody raise a question about whether or not I'm qualified to hold a job teaching.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Warren said she stopped identifying herself as a minority in the directory when she found it did not connect her with individuals with similar backgrounds. ''That was clearly not the use for it, and so I stopped checking it off,'' Ms. Warren said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although she denied any linkage between her heritage - a genealogical record suggests that she is 1/32 American Indian -- and her professional life, Ms. Warren defended its importance to her family roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I have lived in a family that has talked about Native American, talked about tribes, since I've been a little girl,'' Ms. Warren said. ''Being Native American has been part of my story, I guess, since the day I was born.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Warren also tried to draw reporters' attention to a familiar campaign theme of reforming big banks, accusing Mr. Brown of being too close to Wall Street, citing a Boston Globe article that highlights donations made by financial institutions to a political action committee for Mr. Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Scott Brown has been taking more money from Wall Street, not only in his campaign directly, but also in an arrangement with the Republican party, and as The Boston Globe reported it, Scott Brown delivers for Wall Street,'' Ms. Warren said. ''And I think he's made that clear - during Dodd-Frank, Scott Brown was there for Wall Street.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appearance in Braintree followed the online release of a new television ad that features President Obama praising her work as a consumer advocate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ad, the third so far from Ms. Warren's campaign, Mr. Obama describes her as ''a janitor's daughter who has become one of the country's fiercest advocates for the middle class.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also shows Ms. Warren standing with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office. Referring to his administration's new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Ms. Warren conceived of and set up, Mr. Obama says, ''She came up with an idea for a new, independent agency that would have one simple overriding mission: standing up for consumers and middle-class families.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertisement aligns Ms. Warren with President Obama at a time when her campaign is working to liken Mr. Brown to Mitt Romney. ''A vote for Scott Brown is a vote for President Mitt Romney, the Republican Party, Wall Street, and the big corporations,'' read an e-mail sent to supporters on April 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown has portrayed himself a problem solver who avoids partisan battles, and was planning what his campaign billed as a ''major campaign speech'' at Bunker Hill Community College in Boston on Wednesday afternoon. In excerpts circulated by his campaign on Wednesday morning, he described Washington as a ''bitterly divided'' hive of distrust and pointed to bills he had co-sponsored that passed with bipartisan support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I didn't run for this office -- setting out as the longest of long shots, putting I don't know how many miles on my truck -- all so that I could take orders from party leaders or anyone else,'' he says in one excerpt from the speech. ''Each time the roll is called, I know that the decision is mine alone to make, going by my own lights and trying to show the best of Massachusetts.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown noted in the speech that he sponsored two provisions of President Obama's jobs bill last year - legislation that was ultimately blocked by Senate Republicans, including Mr. Brown, except for a handful of provisions. ''A few people told me that maybe it wouldn't be such a good idea to go to the signing ceremony at the White House,'' Mr. Brown says in another excerpt. ''But when the invitation came, I answered 'yes' right away.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ad, which will run statewide starting Wednesday evening, is a ''major ad buy,'' says a campaign spokeswoman, Alethea Harney, who would not specify the exact amount spent on the ad. It replaces an advertisement begun last week that highlighted Ms. Warren's middle-class roots and pushed for student debt relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown has not yet bought television time. According to The Associated Press, the race is the nation's most expensive Senate contest, with the two candidates raising more than $30 million combined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A hypothetical girl goes through life as a poster child for President Obama's policies as the campaign for women's votes continues. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 20 years ago, a multimillion-dollar ad campaign created a fictional couple - &quot;Harry and Louise&quot; - to dramatize the dangers of President Bill Clinton's health care reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, President Obama is trying to use the same Madison Avenue-style technique to demonstrate how his policies would be better for women than would Mitt Romney's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign has invented &quot;Julia,&quot; a fictional woman whose life is chronicled in a slick infographic published on the campaign's Web site on Thursday. Visitors to the site can watch as Julia grows up, receiving benefits from the president's policies along the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At age 3, Julia is enrolled in Head Start programs, thanks to Mr. Obama. By 22, she's covered by her parents' health care because of Mr. Obama's health reforms. At 42, she's getting a small-business loan from the government. When she reaches 67, she's retired and drawing Social Security benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the campaign hoped to put a personal face on the president's accomplishments, it has also managed to provoke a fury among conservatives, who took to Twitter to mock Julia and to condemn the implication that the fictional young woman should be dependent on government policies throughout her life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within moments of being posted online, the #Julia hashtag began trending on Twitter. The bulk of the comments came from people who expressed outrage the depiction of Julia's life, like the conservative pundit Michelle Malkin:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hi @BarackObama. I will read Life of #Julia to my kids to show them how NOT to live their lives -- tethered to Nanny State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin)3 May 12</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One person posted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in college, #Julia cannot drive her Volt b/c BHO has eliminated all coal fired electrical plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- TipOfTheSpear (@CHOWSTL)3 May 12</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under President Romney 3yr old #Julia can afford to choose to stay home with her mommy because her daddy has a good job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Shelli Roberts (@WVShelli)3 May 12</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The graphic - titled &quot;The Life of Julia&quot; - includes criticism of Mr. Romney's positions. At each stage of life, the slide show suggests that Julia would be worse off if Mr. Romney were in charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under the Romney/Ryan budget, interest rates on federal student loans would be allowed to double, affecting Julia and 7.4 million other students,&quot; the graphic says when Julia turns 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's advisers are clearly hoping that the idea of Julia will capture the public's imagination the way the Harry and Louise ads did two decades ago. The story of the fictional couple worrying about their health care helped crystallize opposition to Mr. Clinton's proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's less clear that Mr. Obama's effort will have as much effect. In 1993 and 1994, the health insurance group that broadcast the Harry and Louise ads spent millions of dollars to run them on television. So far, Julia lives only on an Internet page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Julia could backfire on Mr. Obama if voters get the impression that the president has to invent characters who are benefiting from his policies because he can't find real people to portray the situation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential election is six months off, but the attack ads -- short on truth, long on demonization -- have already begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has one set to air in battleground states that accuses presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney of encouraging companies to ship jobs overseas. It ends with the cheeky line: &quot;It's just what you would expect from a guy who had a Swiss bank account.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This comes on the heels of one  that questioned whether Romney would have been willing to go after Osama bin Laden inside Pakistan, the way  Obama did a year ago. Hardly the most presidential move, using a foreign policy victory to launch a cheap shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, for his part, aired a blatantly misleading ad last fall built around a clip of Obama saying, &quot;If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.&quot; Problem is, Obama was not referring to his own situation but was quoting a statement made by John McCain in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the portents of the  nasty election that every observer is predicting. Not only are the attack ads coming early, they are being produced by the two campaigns rather than by surrogate groups, which will gin up even more scurrilous ads later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the public, which has  been telling Washington that it wants solutions, not posturing and bickering, can expect  more posturing and bickering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's willingness to go negative just four years after his &quot;hope&quot; campaign flows in part from the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which  allowed unlimited amounts of money to flow into outside political organizations funding attack ads. Fearful of being outspent by pro-Romney &quot;Super PACs,&quot; Obama's well-financed campaign is acting like its own Super PAC, trying to frame Romney's public image early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Romney, he's coming off an  unusually harsh Republican primary season, filled with strident rhetoric aimed at the party's  most rabid  anti-Obama elements. His Super PACs will continue the offensive even as the candidate tacks to the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political consultants will tell you that campaigns run negative ads because the ads work. One oft-cited example is the &quot;Swift Boat&quot; attacks in 2004 that questioned the credibility of Democratic nominee John Kerry, a Vietnam War veteran. This year, barrages of negative ads helped Romney beat back primary challenges from Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the two sides dug into their war room bunkers with massive war chests, it would be naive to think there won't be more of the same -- unless, of course, the tactic stops working. One can at least hope that will happen. The more brazen the lies and the more intense the barrage, the more likely that undecided voters will be turned off, not swung over. <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign on Tuesday released a 30-second advertisement, ''Swiss Bank Account,'' that combines a rebuttal of a conservative group's recent anti-Obama&nbsp;ad with a slam at Mitt Romney, the likely Republican nominee. Mr. Romney's record of cutting and outsourcing jobs as a businessman and Massachusetts governor, the ad charges, ''is just what you'd expect from a guy who had a Swiss bank account.'' The Obama&nbsp;ad will run in three battleground states -- Ohio, Virginia and Iowa -- where the anti-Obama&nbsp;ad has also appeared. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE SCRIPT The ad begins with a man's emphatic voice reading quotes that appear on screen -- ''over the top,'' ''erroneous,'' ''out of context'' -- to describe the anti-Obama&nbsp;ad. The narrator counters, ''President Obama's clean energy initiatives have helped create jobs for projects across America, not overseas.'' The narrator quickly asks, ''What about Mitt Romney?'' and answers, ''As a corporate C.E.O., he shipped American jobs to places like Mexico and China. As governor, he outsourced state jobs to a call center in India. He's still pushing tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.'' The ad ends with the line about the Swiss bank account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON THE SCREEN Whenever the narrator talks about Mr. Romney or big oil, the screen has a black background. First, the ad shows a small, anti-Obama video clip, and alongside are the narrator's words, in white type, rebutting it. Then the words ''Big Oil's New Attack Ad'' whip over the video clip, covering much of it. The screen briefly turns a more pleasing light blue: A color photo of a determined-looking Mr. Obama is next to a map of the United States under the words ''Jobs created by President Obama's clean energy initiatives.'' The map fills with circles denoting locations of job-creating projects. Back to black, as the phrase ''What about Mitt Romney?'' is followed by black-and-white photos of the candidate. Beneath the phrase ''The Romney Record'' are phrases about shipping jobs overseas (on a global map, Mexico and China suddenly pop out in red); outsourcing Massachusetts jobs (a photo of the Massachusetts State House switches to one of India's Taj Mahal); and supporting tax breaks for outsourcing companies (a photo appears of an abandoned plant). Throughout the ad, in small type, are news media citations supporting its assertions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCURACY The Obama campaign provided additional citations from news media and fact-checking groups to vouch for the ad's content. Those sources have repeatedly assailed the statements in the recent ads from two Republican-led groups, Americans for Prosperity and the Iowa-based American Future Fund, as falsehoods. The ad's assertion that ''big oil'' is behind such attack ads is based on the fact that Americans for Prosperity receives some money from Charles and David Koch, who are oil billionaires. The statements about Mr. Romney's jobs record are drawn from past coverage of his career as governor and at the private equity firm Bain Capital. While the Obama&nbsp;ad makes a big deal of Mr. Romney's Swiss bank account, it is careful to use the word ''had'' -- the account was closed as Mr. Romney began his run for president.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The past few days have provided Mitt Romney a stark reminder of all the advantages an incumbent president has in setting the terms of debate. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney is witnessing the power of the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, the former Massachusetts governor has been the Goliath in a field of Davids - better organized, far richer and more experienced than those who challenged him. In the end, he was able to use his superior resources to dominate, and eventually vanquish, his Republican rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the last few days, as his focus has shifted to President Obama, have provided a stark reminder that the political scales have shifted. Mr. Romney's Boston-based operation faces an incumbent president whose fearsome campaign machinery of 2008 is now bolstered by the incalculable advantages of the office Mr. Obama holds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the president's Chicago campaign team sent a message that little is off limits, using a searing video to raise doubts about Mr. Romney's toughness in a national security crisis. They followed that up on Tuesday with a hard-hitting, kitchen-sink television commercial accusing Mr. Romney of sending jobs overseas and of sheltering his personal wealth in Swiss bank accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then, in a seamless transition, Mr. Obama was in Afghanistanon Tuesday afternoon, vividly reminding Americans of the weighty responsibilities that he shoulders as the nation's commander in chief and - by way of the one-year anniversary - of his decision to approve the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His short speech to the nation - carried live by the TV networks after a top-secret trip to Kabul on Air Force One - offered the kind of platform that no challenger can hope to have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time to renew America -- an America where our children live free from fear and have the skills to claim their dreams,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;A united America of grit and resilience, where sunlight glistens off soaring new towers in downtown Manhattan, and we build our future as one people, as one nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they shift back into campaign mode on Saturday, Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, will bring to a close the first week of the general election campaign with a pair of huge campaign rallies in Ohio and Virginia that are intended to rekindle memories of his 2008 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These kinds of events are one of the hallmarks of this organization&quot; Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, said in an e-mail to the president's supporters. &quot;We're now entering the general election of his final campaign -- this day should be something pretty special.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney is not without resources. He is building a campaign filled with veteran political operatives who will have hundreds of millions of dollars at their disposal. The Republican candidate will be able to tap into a broad, national network of support from activists, wealthy donors, advocacy groups and local party officials hungry to retake the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the president will have to make a case for reelection to an American public that has grown weary of a slow-moving economic recovery that has failed to quickly erase the pain of millions of job losses from the worst recession in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also risks for Mr. Obama as he seeks to balance his roles as candidate and president. Images like those from Afghanistan on Tuesday are a clear reminder that it is Mr. Obama - not anyone else - who has been in charge during the past several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Americans who are struggling economically, that could serve to reinforce the notion that Mr. Obama should shoulder the blame for their plight. And declarations of success overseas can serve to highlight the financial failure that many still see at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the last several days have demonstrated how presidential actions and decisions inevitably become part of the political narrative as Mr. Obama makes his case for a second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the video released on Friday, Mr. Obama's campaign advisers went further than just highlighting the raid on Osama bin Laden. The video raised the question of whether Mr. Romney would have made the decision to send the Navy SEAL team into Pakistan had he been in the Oval Office. &quot;Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?&quot; the video asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's allies reacted furiously, insisting that Mr. Romney would have done the same as the president and chastising Mr. Obama for what they deemed an unfair political attack. One of the fiercest criticisms came from Senator John McCain of Arizona, who accused his onetime rival of trying to score political points on an issue that should be bipartisan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the same president who said, after Bin Laden was dead, that we shouldn't 'spike the ball' after the touchdown,&quot; Mr. McCain said in a statement Friday. &quot;And now Barack Obama is not only trying to score political points by invoking Osama bin Laden, he is doing a shameless end zone dance to help himself get re-elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, the surprise trip to Afghanistan - which, indeed, caught Mr. Romney and the rest of the nation off-guard - generated fewer declarations of outrage by Republicans, at least while Mr. Obama remained overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. Obama insisted on Tuesday that his trip to Afghanistan was not timed for political purposes, and Republicans largely accepted that. Mr. McCain did not attack him for going there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether Mr. Obama was politicizing the war effort by going to Afghanistan, Mr. McCain told CNN: &quot;I can't accuse the president of that. It's important that we send a message to friends and enemies alike that the United States has a long-term commitment to Afghanistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued late Tuesday, Mr. Romney said that he was &quot;pleased that President Obama has returned to Afghanistan. Our troops and the American people deserve to hear from our president about what is at stake in this war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weaving of campaign and official business is the hallmark of presidential reelection campaigns, perfected by previous administrations of both parties. And Mr. Obama's team will be no different in making use of the trappings of his office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How he handles that balance - and how Mr. Romney responds - will go a long way toward determining who wins in the fall.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once an Ambitious Law Firm, Reduced to Grim Dispatches &nbsp;|&nbsp; On Monday, about 50 former Dewey partners opened their in-boxes to find a poignant note. A fellow former partner said he was starting an assistance fund for Dewey staff members and junior lawyers who might find themselves unemployed. The same day, Dewey's remaining partners received a grim dispatch from the firm's leadership. Given Dewey's state, management encouraged them to look for new jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are dark days for Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf, a New York law firm on the brink of collapse amid a partner exodus. Forged by a 2007 merger, it had set its sights on quickly becoming a global powerhouse in corporate law, employing more than 1,300 lawyers in 26 offices across the globe at its peak. Now the firm is teetering under the weight of too much debt and outsize pay guarantees made to its star lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers and staff members, unable to focus on client matters, milled about Dewey's office &quot;shellshocked&quot; on Tuesday, according to an employee. At one point, there was confusion over whether the firm's health care provider had suspended medical coverage, leading the firm to send an officewide e-mail blaming an &quot;administrative issue&quot; for the apparent suspension and explaining that coverage would soon be fully restored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Law firms aren't very joyful places even when things are going well,&quot; said the Dewey employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. &quot;How would I describe the atmosphere now? The first word that comes to mind is funereal.&quot; DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Elizabeth Warren defended her decision to identify herself as a minority years ago, saying she hoped it would help her &quot;meet more people who had grown up like I had grown up.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6:05 p.m. | Updated Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday defended her decision to identify herself as a minority in a directory of law professors in the 1980's and '90s, saying that she hoped it would help her &quot;meet more people who had grown up like I had grown up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking questions after an event in Braintree, Mass. -- and speaking publicly about the controversy for the first time since Friday, when The Boston Herald first wrote about it -- Ms. Warren also responded forcefully to allegations from her Republican opponent, Senator Scott P. Brown, that she had claimed American-Indian ancestry to advance her academic career.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a hard-working teacher, I have won teaching awards, I've written books that have won acclaim,&quot; Ms. Warren said. &quot;I applied for one job in 1978 by letter, and every job I've had since then has been from someone who recruited me into that job. And they've come to me and said - and they have now said publicly - 'Because of your work, we'd like you to come here.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only one, as I understand it, who's raising any question about whether or not I was qualified for my job is Scott Brown,&quot; Ms. Warren continued. &quot;Frankly, I'm a little shocked to hear anybody raise a question about whether or not I'm qualified to hold a job teaching.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Warren said she stopped identifying herself as a minority in the directory when she found it did not connect her with individuals with similar backgrounds. &quot;That was clearly not the use for it, and so I stopped checking it off,&quot; Ms. Warren said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although she denied any linkage between her heritage - a genealogical record suggests that she is 1/32 American Indian -- and her professional life, Ms. Warren defended its importance to her family roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have lived in a family that has talked about Native American, talked about tribes, since I've been a little girl,&quot; Ms. Warren said. &quot;Being Native American has been part of my story, I guess, since the day I was born.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Warren also tried to draw reporters' attention to a familiar campaign theme of reforming big banks, accusing Mr. Brown of being too close to Wall Street, citing a Boston Globe article that highlights donations made by financial institutions to a political action committee for Mr. Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scott Brown has been taking more money from Wall Street, not only in his campaign directly, but also in an arrangement with the Republican party, and as The Boston Globe reported it, Scott Brown delivers for Wall Street,&quot; Ms. Warren said. &quot;And I think he's made that clear - during Dodd-Frank, Scott Brown was there for Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appearance in Braintree followed the online release of a new television ad that features President Obama praising her work as a consumer advocate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ad, the third so far from Ms. Warren's campaign, Mr. Obama describes her as &quot;a janitor's daughter who has become one of the country's fiercest advocates for the middle class.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also shows Ms. Warren standing with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office. Referring to his administration's new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Ms. Warren conceived of and set up, Mr. Obama says, &quot;She came up with an idea for a new, independent agency that would have one simple overriding mission: standing up for consumers and middle-class families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertisement aligns Ms. Warren with President Obama at a time when her campaign is working to liken Mr. Brown to Mitt Romney. &quot;A vote for Scott Brown is a vote for President Mitt Romney, the Republican Party, Wall Street, and the big corporations,&quot; read an e-mail sent to supporters on April 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown has portrayed himself a problem solver who avoids partisan battles, and was planning what his campaign billed as a &quot;major campaign speech&quot; at Bunker Hill Community College in Boston on Wednesday afternoon. In excerpts circulated by his campaign on Wednesday morning, he described Washington as a &quot;bitterly divided&quot; hive of distrust and pointed to bills he had co-sponsored that passed with bipartisan support.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't run for this office -- setting out as the longest of long shots, putting I don't know how many miles on my truck -- all so that I could take orders from party leaders or anyone else,&quot; he says in one excerpt from the speech. &quot;Each time the roll is called, I know that the decision is mine alone to make, going by my own lights and trying to show the best of Massachusetts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown noted in the speech that he sponsored two provisions of President Obama's jobs bill last year - legislation that was ultimately blocked by Senate Republicans, including Mr. Brown, except for a handful of provisions. &quot;A few people told me that maybe it wouldn't be such a good idea to go to the signing ceremony at the White House,&quot; Mr. Brown says in another excerpt.  &quot;But when the invitation came, I answered 'yes' right away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ad, which will run statewide starting Wednesday evening, is a &quot;major ad buy,&quot; says a campaign spokeswoman, Alethea Harney, who would not specify the exact amount spent on the ad. It replaces an advertisement begun last week that highlighted Ms. Warren's middle-class roots and pushed for student debt relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown has not yet bought television time. According to The Associated Press, the race is the nation's most expensive Senate contest, with the two candidates raising more than $30 million combined.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's campaign released an ad trumpeting Obama's decision to conduct the military raid that ended in the killing of Osama bin Laden. Republicans - and some liberals with too much time and too-short memories - hit the roof. How dare he? How tacky. Below the office and out of bounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh please. Are they really that desperate? Do they really have election amnesia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television time and newsprint inches first created and then chronicled the incessant bickering about it, while another week passed with voters distracted from the issues that matter most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what passes for news now: suckling the masses to sleep on the teat of triviality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issues are dry. Outrage is juicy. Screen viewers and page views. Bread and circuses. Whip the horses until the chariot runs off the cliff of the inconsequential and plummets into a valley of cash and ratings - the higher calling of the fourth estate be damned. It's all just a game. Hyperventilation is a high-paying job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, I'm tired of it. I won't play along. It's not a game, particularly if you are one of the millions of Americans stretching your body and mind to their limits to make the ends meet. It's not a game if you don't make money from outrage, but are outraged by how little money you have. It's not a game if you fear, rightfully, that your &quot;unalienable rights&quot; to &quot;life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&quot; are being treated as an alien concept - threatened or denied altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So before I start hyperventilating myself, I'm going to throw up my hands and throw down a gauntlet. I'm going to give you meat. You can get your cake elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's talk about the importance of the president in determining the composition of the Supreme Court and the critical role the court is playing in our lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nominating Supreme Court justices is one of the most profound and enduring legacies of any presidency, and yet the subject gets so little airtime that Americans display a staggering degree of misunderstanding of the court and dissatisfaction with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Pew Research Center poll released Monday, the favorability rating of the Supreme Court has reached a new low. Interesting. But that may be in part because the percentage of respondents with &quot;no opinion&quot; has reached a new high: it has more than doubled since 1985, moving from 8 percent to 19 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a November Pew Center News IQ survey, just under half of all respondents (47 percent) correctly identified Chief Justice John G. Roberts as a conservative. And that lack of understanding wasn't isolated to the less educated. Only 60 percent of those with a college degree got it right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe that helps explain why an October Gallup poll found that the percentage of people who thought that the court was too liberal was higher than those who thought that it was too conservative by nearly half (31 percent to 21 percent). Yes, you read that right: the Roberts court, which gave us Citizens United, was .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the record, as The Times's Adam Liptak pointed out in 2010 after the completion of the Roberts court's fifth term:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In those five years, the court not only moved to the right but also became the most conservative one in living memory, based on an analysis of four sets of political science data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was even a nifty, if frightening, chart with the article that illustrated this rightward turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Associated Press/National Constitution Center poll in August found that more than a quarter of Americans think that the decisions of the Supreme Court don't really affect their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can this be? Where did we go wrong? Part of the problem is the deplorable state of civic education in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A January report by the Campaign for the Civic Mission of Schools was utterly distressing on this front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A majority of America's schools either neglect civic learning or teach it in a minimal or superficial way (too often as an elective). The consequences of this neglect are staggering, but unsurprising. On a recent national assessment in civics, two-thirds of all American students scored below proficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for knowledge of the court in particular, the report found that &quot;almost a third mistakenly believed that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling could be appealed&quot; and that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">when the Supreme Court divides 5-4, roughly one in four (23 percent) believed the decision was referred to Congress for resolution; 16 percent thought it needed to be sent back to the lower courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all the blame rests there, though. We in the media share it. Sex scandals are always big news. Oral arguments rarely are. The prurient trumps the truly important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we have a Democratic president and a Republican candidate who have dramatically different visions of the court, one of whom is likely to nominate a replacement for one or more of the current justices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Times pointed out in October, &quot;Justice Scalia is now 75, as is Anthony Kennedy&quot; and &quot;Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 78. Since 80 is the average retirement age of justices over the past generation, whoever is elected president could shape the court for the next generation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first term, Obama has appointed Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, two relatively liberal justices. Not only has Mitt Romney chosen Robert Bork, a rejected Supreme Court nominee, as one of the chairmen of his Justice Advisory Committee, he has made it clear that he will choose extremely conservative justices:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would have favored justices like Roberts and Alito, Scalia and Thomas. I like justices that follow the Constitution, do not make law from the bench. I would have much rather had a justice of that nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little ambiguity here. Which of these two men will pick the next justice is of grave significance. This - like budgetary priorities and economic stewardship, concern for the earth and the air, and a candidate's penchants for war and appetite for peace - should be on the lips of every pundit and in the minds of every concerned citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't get a do-over.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe it's a hangover - metaphorical, not literal - from the partying of White House Correspondents' Association dinner weekend, but this is feeling like the most vacuous presidential campaign in memory.          Okay, there's a lot of competition in the vacuity derby. This is not the first presidential campaign to feature ponderous hand-wringers, including yours truly, bemoaning the substance-free nature of the political debate.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 2012 campaign is striking for the jarring mismatch between the seriousness of the country's problems and the vagueness of the candidates' policy prescriptions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 2000 race, the New Republic's (now New York magazine's) Jonathan Chait decried the &quot;dumbing-down&quot; of the election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eight years ago, candidates waved graphs and 10-point plans,&quot; Chait wrote. A policy manifesto was the price of admission.           By contrast, he lamented, the 2000 candidates competed to appear anti-intellectual (this came more naturally to some than others). Their quest to demonstrate fuzzy qualities like &quot;authenticity&quot; and &quot;character&quot; (in the wake of Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky) triumphed over serious policy discussions.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the difference between 2000 and 2012: Back then, the flight from substance seemed affordable. The seriousness of 1992 was appropriate for the times, with the country emerging from a painful recession. Eight years later, the economy was booming, the budget was in surplus and Osama bin Laden was unknown to most Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And by current standards, ideological differences between the presidential candidates were muted in 2000. Al Gore and George W. Bush differed most sharply on how best to spend the supposed surplus, and Bush, hard as it may be to recall, advertised himself as a different kind of conservative - compassionate and bipartisan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2012 campaign combines the policy vacuousness of 2000 with the somber setting of 1992 - except that the current environment, foreign and domestic, is much worse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To take just one measure: In 1992, federal debt held by the public was under $3 trillion, or 48 percent of the gross domestic product. By the end of this year, it is expected to exceed $11.5 trillion, or 74 percent of GDP. The problem of skyrocketing federal spending on entitlement programs, evident in 1992, remains, infuriatingly, unresolved - and, by dint of dithering, that much harder to fix. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2008 Obama campaign has been rapped, deservedly, for campaigning on gauzy platitudes. Yet the 2008 race was, in retrospect, gratifyingly specific - specific enough that I was constructing spreadsheets of competing budget promises. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the president who proclaimed in his inaugural address that &quot;the time has come to set aside childish things&quot; is campaigning with dog jokes and a &quot;Pet Lovers for Obama&quot; Facebook group.           The Obama campaign just unveiled an un-illuminating new slogan, &quot;Forward.&quot; Compared to what - &quot;Sideways&quot;? Or, as my colleague Alexandra Petri wondered, &quot;Was 'Reply-All' taken?&quot;           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granted, a president running for reelection has a record on which to be judged; his policy proposals are embedded in budget submissions. But President Obama has been decidedly, deliberately obscure about the road ahead - even the foreseeable issue of how to handle the looming &quot;taxmageddon&quot; moment of expiring tax cuts and spending sequester. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, his new campaign ad, attacking Romney as a heartless outsourcer, ends with the tag line, &quot;It's just what you'd expect from a guy who had a Swiss bank account.&quot;Meanwhile, Romney is running a campaign so substance-free that his primary stump speech featured long chunks of reciting verses from &quot;America the Beautiful,&quot; a scene of over-the-top emptiness straight out of a Christopher Buckley parody. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's policy specifics are heavy on yummy dessert (tax cuts across the board), light on unappetizing spinach (and paid for by eliminating what tax benefit?). He vows spending cuts to tackle the deficit but won't say where. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He promises to repeal &quot;Obamacare&quot; but offers little about what then to do about either rising health care costs or the growing number of Americans without health insurance. He says he would tackle Medicare spending by switching to a &quot;premium support&quot; model of giving seniors a fixed sum to buy coverage - but omits the crucial detail of how fast these vouchers would grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels (R), shortly after endorsing Romney, offered some wise advice. &quot;You have to campaign to govern, not just to win,&quot; Daniels said. &quot;Go ahead and have the confidence in the voters to explain the fix we're in and then tell them with some specificity what we can do to get out of it in a way that's good for everybody.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Obama and Romney are campaigning to win. Governing, unfortunately, is an afterthought.           </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1268 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rarely has a president blended the role of commander in chief with that of campaigner in chief quite as vividly as President Obama has done in the days surrounding the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five days ago, his reelection campaign triggered a partisan debate over whether he had unduly politicized bin Laden's killing by releasing an advertisement that not only trumpeted that achievement but also pointedly questioned whether presumed Republican nominee Mitt Romney would have had the courage to make the same decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As that debate raged, the president, acting as commander in chief, landed in Afghanistan on Tuesday afternoon for an unannounced visit to the war zone. There, he signed a new security agreement with President Hamid Karzai that outlines a partnership between the two countries that will continue after U.S. combat forces end their mission in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's trip muted, at least for a few hours, the partisan exchanges over whether his campaign had crossed a line with its bin Laden video. At the same time, it suggested that between now and November, the president will point to his management of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the administration's efforts to significantly degrade al-Qaeda, as major successes of his first term. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the visit was also a reminder that Obama is keenly aware that he is dealing with a war-weary nation when it comes to Afghanistan. In the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, two-thirds of Americans said they think the decade-long battle there has not been worth the costs it has incurred; nearly half the country feels strongly that way. Even a majority of Republicans hold a negative view of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's message Tuesday night in his nationally televised speech was tailored to directly address that sentiment. It was an effort to say that progress has been made and that the end is coming, however slowly, while trying to assure the Afghans that the United States will not cut and run once the combat mission ends. He said the United States must see this battle through to a successful conclusion, although not one that involves nation-building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have traveled through more than a decade under the dark cloud of war,&quot; he said. &quot;Yet here, in the predawn darkness of Afghanistan, we can see the light of a new day on the horizon. The Iraq war is over. The number of our troops in harm's way has been cut in half, and more will be coming home soon. We have a clear path to fulfill our mission in Afghanistan while delivering justice to al-Qaeda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has sought to strike that balance on Afghanistan ever since he decided to increase the number of U.S. troops there. The details of the new strategic agreement will be important: how many troops will remain in Afghanistan, for how long and under what terms. None of those was immediately available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic issues, not foreign policy concerns, are expected to dominate the general-election debate between Obama and Romney and will largely determine its outcome. On those issues, the president remains vulnerable, particularly if there are signs of stagnation or slippage in the fragile economic recovery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign policy has been a brighter spot for the president. In contrast to the economy, an area in which more Americans disapprove of his actions than approve, Obama's ratings on foreign policy have been generally higher. Even so, Romney has signaled his determination to challenge Obama's record overseas. He has been a sharp critic of the administration's handling of Iran as well as the way the president has dealt with Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Obama, nothing abroad has been as successful or dramatic as the killing of bin Laden a year ago. The raid carried out by Navy SEALs led to a temporary surge in Obama's approval ratings. It was inevitable that the administration and the president's reelection campaign would seek to highlight the accomplishment on its first anniversary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the way they did it opened up the president to criticism that nothing was beyond using for pure political advantage. Former president George W. Bush drew criticism for an ad early in the 2004 campaign that showed briefly a video clip of remains being carried from the site of the World Trade Center. It was considered too political and disrespectful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's&nbsp;ad, which relied heavily on testimony from former president Bill Clinton, was an assertion of the president's nerve and leadership - and there's no question, based on the evidence, that he approved the risky mission over the objections of some of his most senior advisers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But only the president and his team can explain why they chose to mark the anniversary of the killing in this way, rather than letting others speak for them. And why they decided that this was the time to ding Romney on whether he would have gone after bin Laden is another puzzlement, for in doing so, they gave Republicans an opportunity to cry foul at a moment when the nation might have collectively celebrated the demise of a terrorist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's trip to Afghanistan, by contrast, was carefully orchestrated, from the secret flight into Bagram Air Base to his emotional remarks to U.S. troops to his somber speech to the nation. Not surprisingly, even some who had been sharply critical of the bin Laden video - including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) - praised the president for making the trip and negotiating a new agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney responded with an evenhanded statement, saying: &quot;I am pleased that President Obama has returned to Afghanistan. Our troops and the American people deserve to hear from our President about what is at stake in this war. Success in Afghanistan is vital to our nation's security. It would be a tragedy for Afghanistan and a strategic setback for America if the Taliban returned to power and once again created a sanctuary for terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's visit once again demonstrated the power of a commander in chief to shape events and change the conversation. The timing added drama, although none is ever needed when a president lands in a war zone under the veil of secrecy. Its purpose underscored the long continuum that began in the days after 9/11 and the difficulties the United States has encountered there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the aftermath of the visit will bring is only partly predictable. Romney has long been critical of Obama's handling of the war in Afghanistan, particularly the pace of withdrawing the surge forces. The reaction to the Obama campaign video about the bin Laden raid showed the sensitivities of Romney and the Republicans to the president's desire to make foreign policy one of his major advantages in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for a day, Obama commanded the stage and spoke to and for the nation, a powerful display of the advantages available to any president, particularly in an election year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Grenell, the openly gay spokesman recently hired to sharpen the foreign policy message of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, resigned Tuesday in the wake of a full-court press by anti-gay conservatives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several people have told me that senior campaign officials and respected Republicans not affiliated with the campaign had contacted Grenell over the weekend to try to persuade him not to leave. In the weeks since Grenell's hiring was announced, the campaign did not put him out to comment on national security matters and did not use him on a foreign policy conference call with journalists. People familiar with the situation told me that Grenell decided to resign because he felt he was being kept under wraps at a time when national security issues, including the president's ad concerning Osama bin Laden, were front and center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the controversy Grenell's hiring sparked in social media and conservative circles, there was no public statement of support for Grenell by the campaign and no supportive social conservatives were enlisted to calm the waters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grenell declined to comment Tuesday beyond  a statement that noted in part: &quot;[M]y ability to speak clearly and forcefully on the issues has been greatly diminished by the hyper-partisan discussion of personal issues that sometimes comes from a presidential campaign. I want to thank Governor Romney for his belief in me and my abilities and his clear message to me that being openly gay was a non-issue for him and his team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent reports in two conservative publications, National Review and the Daily Caller, reflected the uproar among some social conservatives over Grenell's appointment. Although Grenell also raised the ire of liberal commentators with tweets about certain prominent women - that have since been deleted from Twitter - none of the people I spoke with mentioned the tweets as a factor in his decision to resign. Writing in National Review on Friday, Matthew J. Franck asked: &quot;Suppose Barack Obama comes out - as Grenell wishes he would - in favor of same-sex marriage in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. How fast and how publicly will Richard Grenell decamp from Romney to Obama?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument that Grenell could not be openly gay and serve on a GOP presidential campaign was belied by the fact that Grenell's past jobs include working for such foreign policy figures as the George W. Bush administration's ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressure from social conservatives over Grenell's appointment and the Romney campaign's reluctance to send him out as a spokesman while controversy swirled left Grenell essentially without a job. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades. . . said Tuesday afternoon: &quot;We are disappointed that Ric decided to resign from the campaign for his own personal reasons. We wanted him to stay because he had superior qualifications for the position he was hired to fill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was perhaps too subtle a retort to those calling for Grenell's head, reminding them that Grenell was hired to advise not on gay issues but on foreign policy matters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe it's a hangover - metaphorical, not literal - from the partying of White House Correspondents' Association dinner weekend, but this is feeling like the most vacuous presidential campaign in memory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okay, there's a lot of competition in the vacuity derby. This is not the first presidential campaign to feature ponderous hand-wringers, including yours truly, bemoaning the substance-free nature of the political debate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 2012 campaign is striking for the jarring mismatch between the seriousness of the country's problems and the vagueness of the candidates' policy prescriptions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 2000 race, the New Republic's (now New York magazine's) Jonathan Chait decried the &quot;dumbing-down&quot; of the election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eight years ago, candidates waved graphs and 10-point plans,&quot; Chait wrote. A policy manifesto was the price of admission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, he lamented, the 2000 candidates competed to appear anti-intellectual (this came more naturally to some than others). Their quest to demonstrate fuzzy qualities like &quot;authenticity&quot; and &quot;character&quot; (in the wake of Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky) triumphed over serious policy discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the difference between 2000 and 2012: Back then, the flight from substance seemed affordable. The seriousness of 1992 was appropriate for the times, with the country emerging from a painful recession. Eight years later, the economy was booming, the budget was in surplus and Osama bin Laden was unknown to most Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And by current standards, ideological differences between the presidential candidates were muted in 2000. Al Gore and George W. Bush differed most sharply on how best to spend the supposed surplus, and Bush, hard as it may be to recall, advertised himself as a different kind of conservative - compassionate and bipartisan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2012 campaign combines the policy vacuousness of 2000 with the somber setting of 1992 - except that the current environment, foreign and domestic, is much worse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To take just one measure: In 1992, federal debt held by the public was under $3 trillion, or 48 percent of the gross domestic product. By the end of this year, it is expected to exceed $11.5 trillion, or 74 percent of GDP. The problem of skyrocketing federal spending on entitlement programs, evident in 1992, remains, infuriatingly, unresolved - and, by dint of dithering, that much harder to fix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2008 Obama campaign has been rapped, deservedly, for campaigning on gauzy platitudes. Yet the 2008 race was, in retrospect, gratifyingly specific - specific enough that I was constructing spreadsheets of competing budget promises. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the president who proclaimed in his inaugural address that &quot;the time has come to set aside childish things&quot; is campaigning with dog jokes and a &quot;Pet Lovers for Obama&quot; Facebook group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign just unveiled an un-illuminating new slogan, &quot;Forward.&quot; Compared to what - &quot;Sideways&quot;? Or, as my colleague Alexandra Petri wondered, &quot;Was 'Reply-All' taken?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granted, a president running for reelection has a record on which to be judged; his policy proposals are embedded in budget submissions. But President Obama has been decidedly, deliberately obscure about the road ahead - even the foreseeable issue of how to handle the looming &quot;taxmageddon&quot; moment of expiring tax cuts and spending sequester. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, his new campaign ad, attacking Romney as a heartless outsourcer, ends with the tag line, &quot;It's just what you'd expect from a guy who had a Swiss bank account.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Romney is running a campaign so substance-free that his primary stump speech featured long chunks of reciting verses from &quot;America the Beautiful,&quot; a scene of over-the-top emptiness straight out of a Christopher Buckley parody. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's policy specifics are heavy on yummy dessert (tax cuts across the board), light on unappetizing spinach (and paid for by eliminating what tax benefit?). He vows spending cuts to tackle the deficit but won't say where. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He promises to repeal &quot;Obamacare&quot; but offers little about what then to do about either rising health care costs or the growing number of Americans without health insurance. He says he would tackle Medicare spending by switching to a &quot;premium support&quot; model of giving seniors a fixed sum to buy coverage - but omits the crucial detail of how fast these vouchers would grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels(R), shortly after endorsing Romney, offered some wise advice. &quot;You have to campaign to govern, not just to win,&quot; Daniels said. &quot;Go ahead and have the confidence in the voters to explain the fix we're in and then tell them with some specificity what we can do to get out of it in a way that's good for everybody.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and Romney are campaigning to win. Governing, unfortunately, is an afterthought. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1169 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rarely has a president blended the role of commander in chief with that of campaigner in chief quite as vividly as President Obama has done in the days surrounding the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five days ago, his reelection campaign triggered a partisan debate over whether he had unduly politicized bin Laden's killing by releasing an advertisement that not only trumpeted that achievement but also pointedly questioned whether presumed Republican nominee Mitt Romney would have had the courage to make the same decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As that debate raged, the president, acting as commander in chief, landed in Afghanistan on Tuesday afternoon for an unannounced visit to the war zone. There, he signed a new security agreement with President Hamid Karzai that outlines a partnership between the two countries that will continue after U.S. combat forces end their mission in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's trip muted, at least for a few hours, the partisan exchanges over whether his campaign had crossed a line with its bin Laden video. At the same time, it suggested that between now and November, the president will point to his management of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the administration's efforts to significantly degrade al-Qaeda, as major successes of his first term. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the visit was also a reminder that Obama is keenly aware that he is dealing with a war-weary nation when it comes to Afghanistan. In the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, two-thirds of Americans said they think the decade-long battle there has not been worth the costs it has incurred; nearly half the country feels strongly that way. Even a majority of Republicans hold a negative view of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's message Tuesday night in his nationally televised speech was tailored to directly address that sentiment. It was an effort to say that progress has been made and that the end is coming, however slowly, while trying to assure the Afghans that the United States will not cut and run once the combat mission ends. He said the United States must see this battle through to a successful conclusion, although not one that involves nation-building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have traveled through more than a decade under the dark cloud of war,&quot; he said. &quot;Yet here, in the predawn darkness of Afghanistan, we can see the light of a new day on the horizon. The Iraq war is over. The number of our troops in harm's way has been cut in half, and more will be coming home soon. We have a clear path to fulfill our mission in Afghanistan while delivering justice to al-Qaeda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has sought to strike that balance on Afghanistan ever since he decided to increase the number of U.S. troops there. The details of the new strategic agreement will be important: how many troops will remain in Afghanistan, for how long and under what terms. None of those was immediately available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic issues, not foreign policy concerns, are expected to dominate the general-election debate between Obama and Romney and will largely determine its outcome. On those issues, the president remains vulnerable, particularly if there are signs of stagnation or slippage in the fragile economic recovery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign policy has been a brighter spot for the president. In contrast to the economy, an area in which more Americans disapprove of his actions than approve, Obama's ratings on foreign policy have been generally higher. Even so, Romney has signaled his determination to challenge Obama's record overseas. He has been a sharp critic of the administration's handling of Iran as well as the way the president has dealt with Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Obama, nothing abroad has been as successful or dramatic as the killing of bin Laden a year ago. The raid carried out by Navy SEALs led to a temporary surge in Obama's approval ratings. It was inevitable that the administration and the president's reelection campaign would seek to highlight the accomplishment on its first anniversary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the way they did it opened up the president to criticism that nothing was beyond using for pure political advantage. Former president George W. Bush drew criticism for an ad early in the 2004 campaign that showed briefly a video clip of remains being carried from the site of the World Trade Center. It was considered too political and disrespectful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's&nbsp;ad, which relied heavily on testimony from former president Bill Clinton, was an assertion of the president's nerve and leadership - and there's no question, based on the evidence, that he approved the risky mission over the objections of some of his most senior advisers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But only the president and his team can explain why they chose to mark the anniversary of the killing in this way, rather than letting others speak for them. And why they decided that this was the time to ding Romney on whether he would have gone after bin Laden is another puzzlement, for in doing so, they gave Republicans an opportunity to cry foul at a moment when the nation might have collectively celebrated the demise of a terrorist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's trip to Afghanistan, by contrast, was carefully orchestrated, from the secret flight into Bagram Air Base to his emotional remarks to U.S. troops to his somber speech to the nation. Not surprisingly, even some who had been sharply critical of the bin Laden video - including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) - praised the president for making the trip and negotiating a new agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney responded with an evenhanded statement, saying: &quot;I am pleased that President Obama has returned to Afghanistan. Our troops and the American people deserve to hear from our President about what is at stake in this war. Success in Afghanistan is vital to our nation's security. It would be a tragedy for Afghanistan and a strategic setback for America if the Taliban returned to power and once again created a sanctuary for terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's visit once again demonstrated the power of a commander in chief to shape events and change the conversation. The timing added drama, although none is ever needed when a president lands in a war zone under the veil of secrecy. Its purpose underscored the long continuum that began in the days after 9/11 and the difficulties the United States has encountered there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the aftermath of the visit will bring is only partly predictable. Romney has long been critical of Obama's handling of the war in Afghanistan, particularly the pace of withdrawing the surge forces. The reaction to the Obama campaign video about the bin Laden raid showed the sensitivities of Romney and the Republicans to the president's desire to make foreign policy one of his major advantages in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for a day, Obama commanded the stage and spoke to and for the nation, a powerful display of the advantages available to any president, particularly in an election year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PORTSMOUTH, N.H. -- Mitt Romney said on Monday that ''even Jimmy Carter'' would have issued the order to kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan a year ago, dismissing President Obama's suggestion that Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, would not have followed the same path as the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The swipe at the White House, delivered casually on the rope line of a campaign event here, touched off a pointed exchange with Mr. Obama, who quickly accused Mr. Romney of flip-flopping on an issue that the president has put at the center of his re-election campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempting to minimize Mr. Obama's signature military accomplishment and burnish his own standing as a potential commander in chief, Mr. Romney implied that any president would have acted on the same intelligence as Mr. Obama, who oversaw the daring early-morning raid exactly one year ago Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by reporters if he, too, would have given the order to raid Bin Laden's compound, Mr. Romney replied, ''Of course, of course,'' before taking the jab at Mr. Carter, the former Democratic president known for his longtime work promoting peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Even Jimmy Carter would have given that order,'' Mr. Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, without mentioning his Republican rival by name, suggested that remark ran counter to Mr. Romney's past statements about how far America should go to pursue Bin Laden. Referring to the hunt for the terrorist mastermind in 2007, Mr. Romney said, ''It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person.'' A few days later, though, Mr. Romney said of Bin Laden, ''he's going to pay and he will die.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the raid, Mr. Romney praised the troops in the operation and Mr. Obama for his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Mr. Obama's re-election campaign has seized on the original comment, asserting that Mr. Romney, had he been president, might not have carried out the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I assume that people meant what they said when they said it,'' Mr. Obama said during a news conference on Monday with the Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I said I'd go after Bin Laden if we had a clear shot at him, and I did,'' Mr. Obama said. ''If there are others who have said one thing and now suggest they'd do something else, then I'd let them go ahead and explain it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past week, as the anniversary of Bin Laden's killing has neared, the president's re-election campaign has turned the much-celebrated attack into an unexpected flash point in the presidential race. Republicans have accused the White House of politicizing the killing in an unseemly way. Mr. Obama's allies, eager to deny Republicans their traditional advantage with voters on national security issues, have portrayed it as a legitimate part of Mr. Obama's record and sought to keep Mr. Romney on the defensive over his own remarks on the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has produced a stark commercial about the raid that ominously asks ''Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?'' Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. last week wondered aloud if Bin Laden would be still be alive today had Mr. Romney been president. And on Sunday, during an appearance on ''Meet the Press,'' a campaign adviser to Mr. Obama, Robert Gibbs, said, ''I don't think it's clear that he would'' have given the order to kill Bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By referring to Mr. Carter, the Romney campaign is trying to tie President Obama to a Democratic president considered by many to be weak on national security issues. But the comparison is somewhat strained: the military raid for which Mr. Carter is best known -- the attempted 1980 rescue of hostages from the American Embassy in Tehran -- was a failure, while the raid against Bin Laden was a success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first time that the Romney campaign has invoked Mr. Carter's name. One of Mr. Romney's advisers, Richard Williamson, wrote last week for Foreign Policy magazine that events including North Korea's recent test of a long-range missile ''may be bringing us to a juncture at which the inexperience and incompetence of a presidency crystallizes in the public mind.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In short, we are approaching a Jimmy Carter moment,'' wrote Mr. Williamson, a senior diplomat under several Republican presidents. ''In a perilous world, this is not the kind of leadership our country needs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comparison to Mr. Carter appears to be a response to the White House claim that Mr. Romney would pursue an obsolete, throwback approach to international affairs. And on Tuesday, in an effort to claim an advantage on national security, Mr. Romney will observe Bin Laden's death by visiting a fire station in Lower Manhattan with former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, an outspoken critic of Mr. Obama's policies in the Mideast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of how -- and whether -- to use the death of Bin Laden in the context of a presidential campaign is fraught with emotional and politically delicate baggage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. Romney said the Obama campaign's highlighting of the raid had turned a nonpartisan victory in the war on terror into a crass political ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama rejected on Monday the suggestion that his administration or his campaign had been treating the subject with anything but the seriousness that it deserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I hardly think that you've seen any excessive celebration taking place here,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The American people rightly remember what we as a country accomplished in bringing to justice somebody who killed over 3,000 of our citizens.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, ''For us to use that time for some reflection, to give thanks to those who participated, is entirely appropriate and that's what's been taking place.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What sort of thing is a presidential campaign?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe a campaign is like a courtship. A candidate's job is to woo the electorate, to win the people's affection with charm, familiarity and compassion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe a campaign is like a big version of ''American Idol.'' It is a contest over who is the most talented. In this mode, a candidate's job is to endear himself to the people in the audience with likability and then wow them with his gifts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe, on the other hand, hiring a president is like hiring a plumber. Voters aren't really looking to fall in love with the guy; they just want someone who will fix the pipes. The candidate's job is to list the three or four things he would do if elected and then to hammer home those deliverables again and again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You could make a case that most campaigns are a little of all three, though the proportions vary from year to year. In 2008, Obama ran an uplifting campaign that was part courtship and part ''American Idol.'' Richard Nixon, who lacked such charm, ran workmanlike, plumber campaigns, no pun intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, though, the 2012 presidential campaign is fitting into none of these categories. It's being organized according to a different metaphor. This year, both organizations seem to visualize the campaign as a boxing match or a gang fight. Whichever side can hit the other side harder will somehow get awarded the champion's belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far this year, both President Obama and Mitt Romney seem more passionate about denying the other side victory than about any plank in their own agendas. Both campaigns have developed contempt for their opponent, justifying their belief that everything, then, is permitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both campaigns, you can see the war-room mentality developing early. Attention spans shrink to a point. Gone is much awareness of the world outside the campaign. All focus is on the news blip of the moment -- answering volley for volley. If they bring a knife, you bring a gun. If they throw a bomb, you throw two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides are extraordinarily willing to flout respectability to show that they are tough enough to bare the knuckles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November, the Romney campaign ran a blatantly dishonest ad in which President Obama purportedly admits that if the election is fought on the economy, he will lose. The quote was a distortion, but the effectiveness of the ad was in showing Republican professionals and primary voters that Romney was going to play by gangland rules, that he was tough enough and dishonest enough to do so, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the Obama campaign ran a cheap-shot ad on the death of Osama bin Laden. Part of the ad was Bill Clinton effectively talking about the decision to kill the terrorist. But, in the middle, the Obama people threw in a low-minded attack on Romney. The slam made Clinton look small, it made Obama look small, it turned a moment of genuine accomplishment into a political ploy, but it did follow the rules of gangland: At every second, attack; at every opportunity, drive a shiv between the ribs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This martial-, gangland-style of campaigning apparently makes the people in the campaigns feel hardheaded, professional and Machiavellian. But it's not clear that it's actually the best way to win an election. That's because the style is based on a series of dubious assumptions: that the harshest language is the most persuasive to voters; that what feels good to you as a competitive combatant will also look most attractive to detached onlookers; that over the duration of a six-month campaign, daily combat will continue to look compelling rather than cumulatively revolting; that in a campaign dominated by ''super PAC'' negativity, a presidential candidate is better served by wading into the brawl rather than separating himself from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign-as-warfare metaphor may seem sensible to those inside the hothouse. It may make sense if you think today's swing voters hunger for more combat, more harshness and more attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's probably bad sociology and terrible psychology, given the general disgust with conventional politics. If I were in the campaigns, I'd want to detach from the current rules of engagement and change the nature of the campaign. If I were Obama, I'd play to his personal popularity and run an ''American Idol'' campaign -- likability, balance, safety and talent. If I were Romney, saddled with his personal diffidence, I'd run a plumber campaign -- you may not love me, but here's four things I can do for you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These would be very different campaigns than the ones we are seeing so far: more positive psychology, less negative psychology. A few big messages about fundamental change, less obsession with the daily news cycle. More attention devoted to those turned off by politics, less to the hard-core denizens who are obsessed by it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Republicans rally to unify behind the presumptive nominee Mitt Romney, the campaign's allies are working to heal old wounds from the bruising primary fight. In the latest example, the pro-Romney ''super PAC'' Restore Our Future has scrubbed its YouTube account of all negative ads against Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As noticed by Politico, the group's YouTube account now just has two advertisements: an attack on President Obama's job-creating credentials and a rehashing of a 2008 ad about Mr. Romney saving a young girl gone missing in New York City. The former negative videos have been scrubbed from the group's channel and made private on individual ad pages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The super PAC had been one of the main attack dogs of the Romney primary campaign, critcizing Mr. Gingrich heavily in Iowa and Florida. The group then shifted its attacks to Mr. Santorum following his post-Iowa surge in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign is expected to meet with Mr. Santorum this week to discuss a possible endorsement and ways in which the two former rivals can work together. Mr. Gingrich is expected to formally withdraw from the race this week.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign on Tuesday released a new ad that will run in three crucial swing states, taking aim atMitt Romney's job-creation record and accusing him of shipping jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's just what you would expect from a guy who had a Swiss bank account,&quot; an announcer says as a picture of a grinning Mr. Romney appears on the screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is the latest example of the president directly engaging with the man he will face in November as the presumptive Republican nominee - whether through online video attacks or in pointed remarks as he campaigns in states that will be crucial to winning a majority in the Electoral College. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is set to run in Iowa, Ohio and Virginia, all states that the president and his campaign think could be pivotal in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, however, is not the only one on the receiving end of the president's barbs in this commercial. As it has in other ads, the campaign assails &quot;big oil&quot; for running attack ads against Mr. Obama. &quot;Big oil&quot; is a reference to the conservative political action group Americans for Prosperity, which is financed in part by the Koch brothers and last week began a $6.1 million ad campaign that criticized the president's &quot;green energy&quot; initiatives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad's accusation? President Obama's program to finance energy efficient technologies is sending money to companies overseas. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A new attack ad asks if Mitt Romney would have ordered the raid to kill Osama bin Laden. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the general election unofficially under way, President Obama needs to decide how to campaign on his military record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is not whether he has real achievements. He ended the war in Iraq that his predecessor bungled . He's winding down the war in Afghanistan that his predecessor also bungled. He's stepped up the use of drone attacks on Qaeda leaders, very effectively, although in ways that have sparked a serious legal debate. And he approved the raid to kill Osama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is how he presents this record to voters. Will he rattle his sabre, or try something more dignified?<BR><BR>To mark the anniversary of bin Laden's death, the Obama team released a new ad that features Bill Clinton praising Mr. Obama's courage, explaining that a raid in the dead of night in dicey territory could have ended in disaster. So far, so unobjectionable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the ad veers off the high road and asks, &quot;Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?&quot; It also reminds voters that, several years ago, Mr. Romney said it wasn't &quot;worth moving heaven and earth spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This heavy-handed attack has encouraged criticism from both the right and the left. Sen. John McCain accused the president of &quot;diminishing the memory of September 11th.&quot; The editor of the Huffington Post, Arianna Huffington, called the ad &quot;despicable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think Mr. McCain was off base. As for Ms. Huffington, it seems more like politics as usual to me, though that can be pretty despicable. Certainly the ad's a throwback to the Bush ways. Mr. Bush shamelessly exploited the Sept. 11th attacks at every opportunity, obliquely, and sometimes even overtly, suggesting that Democrats were too cowardly to deal with terrorists. One of Mr. Bush's 2004&nbsp;campaign ads featured a pack of wolves and said Senator John Kerry didn't have the guts to face up to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the fact that Mr. Bush preyed on fear to get re-elected does not excuse Mr. Obama for trying the same. There's really no need for him to imitate one of our least appealing president's least appealing campaign strategies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;President Obama's surprise trip to Afghanistan comes even as his re-election campaign has set off a heated debate about the propriety of using Osama bin Laden's killing to make a political argument in the battle for the White House with Mitt Romney.&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's surprise trip to Afghanistan comes even as his re-election campaign has set off a debate about the propriety of using Osama bin Laden's killing to make a political argument in the battle with Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trip will give Mr. Obama a fresh view of the war he inherited and expanded. The president plans to announce an agreement with the leaders of Afghanistan that will guide the deployment of American troops in the country as they make a transition out of the war over the next two and a half years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the timing of Mr. Obama's visit to Afghanistan - and the address to the nation that he is scheduled to give Tuesday night - could add fuel criticism that he is politicizing the war on terrorism for his own gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney and his allies have already accused the president of inappropriately turning the anniversary of the raid on Bin Laden's Pakistan camp into a partisan attack by releasing a video that questions whether Mr. Romney would have authorized the raid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's not make the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden a politically divisive event,&quot; Mr. Romney said on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; on Tuesday. &quot;There are plenty of differences between President Obama and myself, but let's not make up ones.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney made those comments even as Mr. Obama was secretly flying to Afghanistan on Air Force One - a trip that was, as is standard, shrouded in secrecy because of the security risks of sending a president into a war zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such events are one of the biggest advantages of incumbency, giving a sitting president the opportunity to appear presidential on a world stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Mr. Obama said&nbsp; he was not making the Bin Laden killing political, telling reporters at the White House, &quot;I hardly think you've seen any excessive celebration taking place here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In retrospect, Mr. Obama may have been obliquely referring to&nbsp; his planned trip when he suggested that it is not beyond the bounds of propriety for the country to mark the anniversary of bin Laden's death. &quot;I think for us to use that time for some reflection, to give thanks to those who participated, is entirely appropriate, and that's what's been taking place,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the trip brings into sharper focus the debate that Mr. Obama's campaign sparked with the ad last week. The ad raised the question of whether Mr. Romney would have made the decision to send the Navy SEAL team into Pakistan had he been in the Oval Office. &quot;Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?&quot; the ad asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's allies reacted furiously, insisting that Mr. Romney would have done the same as the president and chastising Mr. Obama for what they deemed an unfair political attack. One of the fiercest criticisms came from Senator John McCain of Arizona, who accused his onetime rival of trying to score political points on an issue that should be bipartisan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the same president who said, after Bin Laden was dead, that we shouldn't 'spike the ball' after the touchdown,&quot; Mr. McCain said in a statement Friday. &quot;And now Barack Obama is not only trying to score political points by invoking Osama bin Laden, he is doing a shameless end-zone dance to help himself get re-elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney and the president's other critics will have to step gingerly as they deal with Mr. Obama's visit to Afghanistan. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Romney praised the president's actions a year ago today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I commend all those who planned and conducted the bin Laden raid, and I applaud President Obama for giving the go-ahead for the mission,&quot; he said in a statement released by his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But later in the day, Mr. Romney appeared in New York City with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York. Mr. Giuliani accused the president of using the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks as negative campaigning, calling it &quot;a mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tommy Vietor, the National Security Council spokesman, said that the trip had long been planned and that it&nbsp; should not spark criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Vietor said the agreement to be signed by Mr. Obama and Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan, was the result of 20 months of negotiations. He said the president wanted to sign it in Afghanistan before a NATO meeting this month in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A trip like this is planned significantly in advance,&quot; Mr. Vietor said. &quot;It's impossible to predict the political news of the day. Obviously that has nothing to do with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Richard Grenell, a longtime Republican foreign policy spokesman hired last month by Mitt Romney's campaign, resigned after being attacked by social conservatives. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Grenell, an openly gay and longtime Republican foreign policy spokesman hired last month by Mitt Romney's campaign, resigned abruptly on Tuesday after his appointment came under attack by antigay activists in the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are disappointed that Ric decided to resign from the campaign for his own personal reasons,&quot; Matt Rhoades, the Romney campaign manager, said in a statement. &quot;We wanted him to stay because he had superior qualifications for the position he was hired to fill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Grenell served four American ambassadors to the United Nations during the presidency of George W. Bush. But his selection had been sharply criticized by some social conservatives soon after he was named less than two weeks ago as Mr. Romney's campaign spokesman for national security issues. In addition to concerns from some in the party about his sexual orientation, Mr. Grenell had been criticized for sometimes caustic Twitter posts about women including Rachel Maddow, the MSNBC host, and Callista Gingrich, the wife of Newt Gingrich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement to Jennifer Rubin, the Washington Post columnist who first reported the resignation, Mr. Grenell said: &quot;While I welcomed the challenge to confront President Obama's foreign policy failures and weak leadership on the world stage, my ability to speak clearly and forcefully on the issues has been greatly diminished by the hyperpartisan discussion of personal issues that sometimes comes from a presidential campaign. I want to thank Governor Romney for his belief in me and my abilities and his clear message to me that being openly gay was a non-issue for him and his team.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;super PAC&quot; that spent tens of millions of dollars to help make Mitt Romney the presumptive Republican nominee is now getting ready to spend even more to make him president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, Restore Our Future, has begun buying as much $4 million worth of 30-second television advertisements in a least eight general election swing states, according to a Democrat who tracks media buys. The buys, first reporter by Chuck Todd of NBC, follow Mr. Romney's emergence as his party's presumptive nominee last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expenditure suggests that Restore Our Future, which had about $6.5 million in cash on hand at the end of March, is pivoting to play a significant role in the early stages of Mr. Romney's general election campaign against President Obama, during a period when Mr. Obama is moving aggressively to define the former Massachusetts governor as an out-of-touch corporate profiteer. Mr. Romney himself had about $10 million in cash on hand at the end of March, one-tenth of the enormous war chest Mr. Obama accumulated while Mr. Romney was battling for his party's nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Mr. Obama's campaign was preparing to run ads against Mr. Romney in Iowa, Ohio and Virginia, targeting his business career and Swiss bank account.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mitt Romney comes to Manhattan and meets Rudolph W. Giuliani to talk about Bin Laden. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the anniversary of the killing of Osama bin Laden, Mitt Romney used an appearance at a downtown Manhattan fire house to keep the pot boiling between him and President Obama over the decision to pursue Bin Laden into Pakistan, accusing Mr. Obama of politicizing the issue.     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney said that he, too, would have ordered Navy Seals to assault Bin Laden's compound one year ago. But he repeated criticism he made in 2007 that Mr. Obama, then a candidate, was &quot;na&iuml;ve&quot; to announce he would unilaterally pursue Bin Laden into a country that was a shaky ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a very, if you will, fragile and flammable time in Pakistan,'' Mr. Romney said during an appearance with Rudolph W. Giuliani at Engine 24, Ladder 5 in SoHo. &quot;And I thought it was a mistake of him as a candidate for the presidency of the United States to announce he would go in - rather than to say, as I did, we reserve the right to go wherever we feel is appropriate to secure the interests of the United States of America, and certainly to track Osama bin Laden anywhere he could be found.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments came just hours before word came that President Obama had landed in Afghanistan to sign a partnership agreement to wind down the U.S. role in the war there.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney made no effort to minimize the president's decision, as he had on Monday when he suggested any occupant of the White House would have done the same.  He gave Mr. Obama credit for ordering the raid, naming him as one &quot;we respect and admire,&quot; along with the intelligence community, the armed services and Navy Seals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Romney got in a shot at Mr. Obama for politicizing the decision. He did so the day after Mr. Obama had accused Mr. Romney of flip-flopping because he had suggested in 2007 that it was not worth &quot;moving heaven and earth&quot; and spending billions of dollars to catch one individual. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Obama, of course, the Bin Laden killing is a highlight of his presidency, one that is a key argument for a second term. His re-election campaign is running a striking television advertisement narrated by Bill Clinton praising his fortitude and suggesting that Mr. Romney would not have approved such a raid.        </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney on Tuesday faulted Mr. Obama for &quot;politicizing&quot; the killing and said that &quot;trying to draw a distinction between himself and myself was an inappropriate use of the very important event that brought America together.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As political theater, his visit to the red-brick firehouse was poignant. Eleven men from the house died on Sept. 11, 2001, and, like the aftershock of an earthquake, two more died in a fire at the Deutsche Bank tower at ground zero, which was in the process of being demolished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney and Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor, earlier stopped at Joe's Pizza around the corner and delivered a half-dozen pies to the firehouse for lunch, a meeting closed to outsiders. They emerged to answer questions from a sizable press corps, interrupted at times by protesters down the block and a helicopter churning overhead.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he, too, thought the president was politicizing the anniversary, Mr. Giuliani sought the high ground. &quot;I respect his decision very much and I give him great credit for it,'' he said of the raid.  &quot;I wish he wouldn't use it as a source of negative campaigning.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney had walked away from the microphone, pressed by his handlers to begin heading for the airport. He looked back and noticed Mr. Giuliani speaking.  &quot;I didn't know you're still here, but I'm going to go,'' he told him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good luck,'' Mr. Giuliani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you, Mayor.  Appreciate your help.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just then a fire engine's sirens wailed, drowning out press and politicians as it answered a call.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;How can we not politicize national security, given how central it is to the work of the modern presidency? <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savvy politicians know that it's usually a good sign when a political advertisement provokes cries of outrage from the opposition. The picture gets murkier, though, when that same advertisement prompts high-minded expressions of disappointment from the politician's own supporters. Sometimes that's a signal that the ad in question has overreached and risks a backlash. But sometimes it's just a sign that those high-minded supporters don't recognize the weakness that the ad is trying to exploit, or just don't have the stomach for a necessary fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the dilemma the Obama re-election campaign faces with the ad it released recently suggesting that Mitt Romney might not have given the order to send Navy SEALS to kill Osama Bin Laden. The attack clearly touched a nerve with Republicans, but it also earned the White House a rebuke from several liberals, including no less a left-wing eminence than Arianna Huffington. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Early Show on CBS, Huffington called the ad &quot;despicable,&quot; suggested that questioning an opponent's ability to serve as commander-in-chief is &quot;not the way to run campaigns on either side,&quot; and compared the attack to the &quot;3 A.M. phone call&quot; ad Hillary Clinton's campaign released in 2008, which made a similar case against then-candidate Obama's ability to make the toughest national security decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When even Huffington thinks a Democratic attack goes too far, it usually has. And yet a moment's scrutiny reveals that her argument doesn't make much sense. Why do we have election seasons, after all, if not to argue about which candidate would be better-suited to making decisions that put Americans in harm's way overseas? How can we  politicize national security, given how central it is to the work of the modern presidency, and how unconstrained the executive branch's national security powers have become no matter which party holds the White House?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the arguments that Hillary Clinton partisans mounted in defense of that &quot;3 A.M. ad,&quot; and that George W. Bush's partisans mounted in defense of his 9/11-centric 2004 re-election campaign. And those arguments were right! It's one thing to say that candidates shouldn't impugn one another's patriotism. But impugning a rival's judgment, as the Obama camp's Bin Laden advertisement just did, is precisely what a presidential campaign is for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategically, too, the White House has every reason to press these kind of arguments to the hilt. As I've noted in this space before, most of President Obama's record is unpopular - sometimes deeply so - with the voting public. But the big exception is national security, where polls often show that Obama has built up a fair amount of credibility with voters. Foreign policy thus offers the White House its best (and perhaps only) opportunity to draw contrasts with Romney by highlighting the president's actual accomplishments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas on domestic issues the Romney camp can answer almost every Obama attack by changing the subject to the unemployment rate, on foreign policy the Republican message is much more muddled and uncertain. In the usual order of things, Romney would be simply try to out-hawk the president, but this is not a hawkish moment in American politics. Outside of the most Republican portions of the electorate, the Iraq War is still widely regarded as a bad blunder, and even conservatives are increasingly supportive of a speedy exit from Afghanistan. Public opinion on Iran is unsettled, but there is next to no support for the kind of stepped-up American intervention in Syria that some Republicans have championed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, by keeping much of the Bush-era anti-terror architecture in place and stepping up covert warfare from Waziristan to the Horn of Africa, the president has effectively undercut the soft-on-terror arguments that Republicans used so effectively against John Kerry in 2004. Indeed, the most compelling criticisms of this White House have come from libertarians and anti-interventionists on both the left and right, on issues ranging from the dubiously-legal &quot;kinetic military action&quot; in Libya to the White House's willingness to order the assassination of an American citizen abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This explains why the Republican Party's foreign policy rhetoric can seem so opportunistic and confused. The Rand Paul-led, anti-interventionist wing of the party arguably has a more coherent case against the president than the more hawkish wing, which often finds itself emphasizing what it has in common with the president - as Florida Senator Marco Rubio did in a widely-touted foreign policy address defending interventionism last week. (Tellingly, the word &quot;Iraq&quot; did not appear in his remarks.) Yet the hawkish line of attack is still the Republican default, and Mitt Romney's case -- to date, at least -- against the president has generally circled back to its tropes and premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is an incoherence that James Poulos described well in a recent column in Forbes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Obama, the GOP has become like Woody Allen's neurotic diner: the food is horrible, and such small portions! The president is condemned for leading and for leading from behind; for relying too much on talk and too much on drones; for slavishly kowtowing to foreign leaders and for arrogantly refusing to stroke foreign leaders. Obama's foreign policy has paralyzed the GOP by laying bare just how much Republicans collectively refuse to fully commit to one grand, unifying possibility in international affairs - including the possibility of stepping away from sweeping principles and playing it by ear for a while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arianna Huffington's qualms notwithstanding, it would be political malpractice for the president not to exploit this kind of confusion with national security attacks on his opponent. Indeed, Republicans who care about these issues should welcome them. Advertisements like the Bin Laden spot and political stunts like last night's almost-victory speech in Afghanistan present a challenge to the right, but also an opportunity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign affords conservatives their best chance yet to come to terms with the Bush era in foreign policy and its aftermath - to figure out what they think about the recent past, where they stand at present and where they would have the country go from here.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said Monday that his team is not celebrating the anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death, and he questioned whether Republican opponent Mitt Romney would have ordered the kind of raid that killed the architect of 9/11. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said that I'd go after bin Laden if we had a clear shot at him, and I did,&quot; Obama said during a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's anniversary of the raid on bin Laden's compound has generated speeches, news stories and an Obama political ad spotlighting the president's decision to authorize the mission deep into Pakistan territory and questioning whether Romney would have done the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, campaigning in New Hampshire, said &quot;of course&quot; he would have authorized the raid that took place  May 2 of last year. &quot;Even Jimmy Carter would have given that order,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about that statement, Obama told reporters to &quot;take a look at people's previous statements.&quot; In 2007, Romney criticized Obama for saying he would go into Pakistan to hunt down terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While not citing Romney by name, Obama said, &quot;If there are others who have said one thing and now suggest they'd do something else, then I'd go ahead and let them explain it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney and aides have protested the White House approach to the bin Laden anniversary, saying it is politicizing an event that should be a source of unity for the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unfortunate that President Obama would prefer to use what was a good day for all Americans as a cheap political ploy and an opportunity to distort Gov. Romney's strong policies on the war on terror,&quot; said Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the White House, Obama said, &quot;I hardly think that you've seen any excessive celebration taking place here.&quot; He called the anniversary a time for reflection and &quot;to give thanks to those who participated is entirely appropriate. And that's what's been taking place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at their news conference after their bilateral meeting, Obama and Noda both criticized North Korea for its recent failed rocket launch, as well as new threats to conduct another nuclear test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. and Japanese leaders vowed to stand together against such provocations. The president said another nuclear test will continue to isolate the regime and cost them global aid, and Noda agreed, saying other nations need to pressure North Korea against conducting another nuclear test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also refused to comment on reports that the U.S. is sheltering blind Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng, after he escaped house arrest. &quot;What I would like to emphasize is that every time we meet with China, the issue of human rights comes up,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Japanese reporter asked Obama and Noda whether they had discussed the role of China in the Asia-Pacific region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, Noda said through an interpreter, adding that he is seeking more maritime cooperation with China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the U.S. welcomes &quot;a peacefully rising China&quot; and is also seeking more cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about a dispute over a U.S. military base in Okinawa and whether the base will be moved, Noda said he and Obama are working on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he is seeking to speed up the relocation of the Okinawa base, but without compromising mutual defense needs. <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call it America's newest reality show: Who wants to be vice president?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the top contestants -- er, potential candidates -- to become Mitt Romney's running mate have been strutting their stuff in policy speeches, new books and joint campaign appearances in ways that look a lot like public auditions for the Republican ticket even as some deny interest in the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though vice presidential hopefuls have jockeyed for the job in the past, typically behind the scenes, there's been more action in public view this year than ever before. Democratic consultant Dan Gerstein says that might reflect what he dubs &quot;the celebrity-fication of politics&quot; and the new media age. The fact that Romney's options are wide open -- there's no also-ran from the primaries he's forced to consider, for instance -- also has stoked a sense of open competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're doing tryouts almost like spring training,&quot; says Paul Light, a political scientist at New York University. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Sen. Marco Rubio  outlined his foreign policy views at the Brookings Institution one afternoon last week; the next morning it was Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan delivering an address on budget policy at Georgetown University. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley  is on the road, promoting her new memoirs. An hour after President Obama's campaign announced that his opening rally would be this week in Ohio, home-state Sen. Rob Portman  sent out a not-so-welcoming statement via the Romney campaign that said Obama was coming to Columbus &quot;to argue for four more years of the same failed policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell   is featured in a TV ad paid for by his political action committee that touts his record as governor. &quot;Virginia's growing strong, and so is our future,&quot; a beaming McDonnell declares in the ad, which airs in the Washington market and elsewhere in the Old Dominion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why would a governor barred by term limits from seeking re-election run a spot like that? &quot;I guess he wanted to raise his hand,&quot; says GOP strategist Frank Donatelli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These ads aren't running in Boston,&quot; site of Romney's headquarters, protests McDonnell spokesman Tucker Martin. &quot;They're running in South Boston, Va. These are ads celebrating Virginia and Virginians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increased public efforts are in part a response to concern over what happened in 2008. Republican nominee John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin -- a little-known, first-term Alaska governor -- and the questions raised during the campaign about her preparedness for the White House are chronicled in the best-selling book Game Change  and an HBO movie released in March. (Palin and her allies call the portrayal of her in the book and movie inaccurate and unfair.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another contributing factor: the sordid trial underway in North Carolina of former senator John Edwards, Democrat John Kerry's running mate in 2004. He is charged with misusing campaign funds during his 2008 presidential bid in an effort to hide his mistress and their child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reaction has been more trial-ballooning,&quot; Light says, a sort of public vetting that can expose strengths and secrets before the nominee commits to anyone. That doesn't mean the Romney camp itself is floating the trial balloons, he adds: &quot;There are lot of wannabees out there, trying to get some visibility so that they can make the first cut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking advantage of the media's attention could have other beneficial side effects for potential running mates, from raising their public profile to positioning them for their own run at the presidency down the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the joint campaigning has occurred in the past,&quot; says Joel Goldstein, a St. Louis University Law School professor and author of The Modern American Vice Presidency. &quot;But I don't ever remember a situation where so many vice presidential mentionees so visibly exploited the spotlight from vice presidential speculation as is occurring this year, and at such an early point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearing away hurdles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some prospective running mates seem to be moving to address possible hurdles in their way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider McDonnell, a champion for conservative social policies, who moved this year to moderate the provisions of an anti-abortion bill he had promised to sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, after a national furor, he urged the Virginia Legislature to amend a bill that would have required some women to undergo an invasive, transvaginal ultrasound before an abortion. The measure was modified to allow women to opt instead for an abdominal ultrasound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's Rubio, a former Florida state legislative leader who was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010. He's had little opportunity to demonstrate expertise on foreign policy. So a few weeks ago at the Summit of the Americas in Colombia, the freshman senator met one-on-one with Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo  and Chilean President Sebastin Piera,  putting out photos and a news release afterward. At the think-tank speech last week, he outlined a sweeping and generally centrist view of the world. He was introduced by Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, chosen by Democrat Al Gore as his running mate in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether seeking the spotlight is an entirely smart idea is another question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big events give officials a chance to shine -- and to stumble. Romney's buttoned-down management style, exhibited in his tightly run campaign operation, hasn't encouraged or rewarded freelancing. &quot;The cynic in me says the more visible they are out on the campaign trail, the less likely they're going to be on the ticket,&quot; Gerstein says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney hasn't been forthcoming about how he'll proceed to choose a running mate, a process he said last week was &quot;just beginning.&quot; He has appointed a longtime aide, Beth Myers, to oversee a search that she promises will be comprehensive and thorough. For the finalists, it will involve intensive private vetting of financial records and personal history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She'll present Mitt with all the facts, and he'll make the decision,&quot; spokeswoman Andrea Saul says of Myers. &quot;She thinks he'll look for someone he gets along with and could take over the presidency, should the person need to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some prospects have been by his side for months, helping him prevail in the Republican primaries and in the process getting to know him better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has become an occasional behind-the-scenes adviser, energized crowds and parried with protesters at a rally in Exeter and elsewhere in New Hampshire just before the state's January primary. (Monday, during a visit to a high school history class in Plainsboro, N.J., Christie said he would &quot;listen&quot; if Romney asked him to join the ticket. &quot;He might be able to convince me,&quot; Christie said, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. &quot;He's a convincing guy.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portman stumped with Romney in Ohio, a crucial win in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And before the Wisconsin primary in April, when his victory effectively settled the nomination, Romney and Ryan crisscrossed the state together. Ryan's endorsement gave Romney credibility with the state's most conservative voters, and the presidential candidate offered his own endorsement of Ryan's austere budget plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a town-hall-style meeting in Muskego three days before the vote, the two tall, earnest, dark-haired men looked like they could have been brothers. &quot;His support is a big deal,&quot; Romney said of Ryan. Ryan called Romney's election crucial: &quot;Our country is at that sort of proverbial fork in the road.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's the goal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before he decides whom to pick, Romney will have to decide what he wants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubio, a Cuban American, could give the GOP an opening with Latino voters, the nation's fastest-growing ethnic group and one that leans overwhelmingly Democratic. McDonnell and Ryan are favorites of the strong Tea Party supporters who were slow to warm to the former Massachusetts governor. Haley, the first woman elected governor in South Carolina, might boost him among women and narrow the gender gap. Romney campaigned Monday in New Hampshire with Sen. Kelly Ayotte,  another  prospect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portman, who was a seven-term Ohio congressman and served as trade representative and budget director in President George W. Bush's administration before being elected to the Senate, could help Romney carry what has been the GOP's most crucial swing state: No Republican has won the White House without carrying Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historically, there are three paths&quot; for a presidential nominee, says Haley Barbour, a former governor of Mississippi and former chairman of the Republican National Committee. &quot;One is the Hippocratic  path, which is 'do no harm.' One is to pick somebody you believe will give you a big state that otherwise you wouldn't win. And the last is to pick somebody who might be a game-changer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That third option -- the course taken by McCain with Palin and by Democrat Walter Mondale in 1984 when he picked New York Rep. Geraldine Ferraro -- is typically a political Hail Mary for a campaign that seems to be on the road to defeat without dramatic action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ability of any vice presidential candidate to affect  the election's outcome is limited, though. The last time that clearly happened was more than a half-century ago, when Lyndon Johnson helped John Kennedy narrowly carry LBJ's home state of Texas and with it win the White House in 1960.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the process of choosing a running mate can reveal a lot about how a nominee would operate as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, picking his No. 2 is his No. 1 decision,&quot; says Gary Burnison, CEO of Korn/Ferry International, the world's largest executive recruitment firm. He looks at the vice presidential search as an elite case of executive hiring. &quot;It sets a tone, and I think the process and the rationale is probably as important as the ultimate pick. It reveals his decision style.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's choice reflected the trust-your-gut instincts of a fighter pilot or a surgeon, he says. &quot;With a fighter pilot or a surgeon, you want quick decisions, like Sully on the Hudson,&quot; a reference to the U.S. Airways pilot who successfully ditched his plane on the Hudson River in 2009. In contrast, Romney reflects the style of the business CEO he once was at Bain Capital, reflective and data-driven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One more thing: Don't expect Romney to settle on a choice until he absolutely must. &quot;You don't communicate until you have all the facts; that's first and foremost,&quot; Burnison says. &quot;It's not an overnight decision.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has unleashed a particularly unusual fundraiser for his 2012 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Internet a             d starts with a two-toned blue background, like dozens of other pro-Obama spots. Then the furry star pops into the frame, tongue out and ready to frolic. &quot;Join Pet Lovers for Obama,&quot; the ad implores.          The unlikely pitchman is Bo, the White House family pet, who may well be the first &quot;first dog&quot; to emerge as a central player in a presidential reelection campaign.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political pets have long attracted inordinate attention, from then-Sen. Richard M. Nixon's dog, Checkers - the focus of an early 1950s scandal that slowed his political ascent - to Bill Clinton's adopted stray cat, Socks. In 2004, George W. Bush's campaign put together a tongue-in-cheek video for the Republican National Convention seeking advice from Barney, Bush's Scottish terrier, on how to attract the &quot;canine vote.&quot;But Obama appears to be breaking ground by featuring his Portuguese water dog so prominently in official campaign advertisements and fundraising efforts, part of a broader focus on the president's family.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          The strategy is also an attempt to capitalize on the persistent controversy over canines that has dogged the 2012 race. Obama's presumed GOP rival, Mitt Romney, has come under fire from Democrats and animal-rights activists for transporting his now-deceased Irish setter, Seamus, in a crate tied atop the family station wagon for a 12-hour trip to Canada in the 1980s. Republicans, in turn, have highlighted Obama's recollection in his 2004 autobiography that he had eaten dog meat as a child in Indonesia.          &quot;My stepfather always told me, 'It's a boy-eat-dog world out there,' &quot; Obama said to laughter at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark McKinnon, a top Bush campaign adviser, joked that the 2012 race &quot;has gone to the dogs.&quot; But, he added, a candidate's relationship with animals can serve as an important marker for many voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People look at a whole constellation of attributes when they vote for president,&quot; McKinnon said. &quot;Pet lover may not be high on the list, but it's on the list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Obama campaign, pet lovers are just one niche among many, with specific appeals aimed at women, African Americans, students, military families and countless others. The result is a campaign that might be the most micro-targeted in history, attempting to use the power of the Web and social media to reach ever-thinner slices of the electorate.Nearly half of the Obama campaign's March budget - $6.7 million - went toward Internet ads, many of them targeting specific demographic or interest groups. Romney has been less aggressive in micro-targeting efforts and has spent only a tenth as much on online advertising. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro-Obama Internet ads featuring Bo, which have run steadily in recent months, urge voters to&quot;Bark for Barack&quot; by donating to the campaign. Official &quot;Pet Lovers for Obama&quot; pages on Facebook, Pinterest and other social media sites feature pictures of the president and his dog and invite supporters to share their own pet photos.           The campaign also offers nearly a dozen Bo- or pet-themed products on its Web site, including a $12 &quot;Cats for Obama&quot; collar and a $35 red, white and blue &quot;Obama Dog&quot; sweater. &quot;This adorable Obama dog sweater will keep your furry friend feeling cozy and looking stylish,&quot; the description says.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other subgroups targeted by the Obama campaign include nurses (featuring bumper stickers, magnets and T-shirts); Latinos (with a line of products including clothing and buttons); and young mothers (including a $20 &quot;Babies for Obama&quot; onesie).          The categories expand on Obama's efforts in 2008, which pushed the boundaries of political campaigns by aggressively marketing the candidate to groups within the disparate Democratic base. The segmenting underscores the importance that turnout is likely to play in the tightening race between Obama and Romney.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither the Obama nor Romney campaigns would discuss their micro-targeting activities or plans. Romney, who until this month was focused on winning the bitter GOP primaries, is expected to ramp up his targeting efforts in coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has already made fundraising appeals aimed at mothers after a Democratic strategist belittled Ann Romney's stay-at-home-mom role. The Republican candidate's campaign Web site offers $6 bumper stickers proclaiming that &quot;Moms Drive the Economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said micro-targeting is particularly useful when combined with Facebook, Twitter and other social media, encouraging like-minded supporters to recruit peers and help spread &quot;viral&quot; campaign messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't really target 'swing voters' on social media because nobody thinks of themselves that way,&quot; Lake said. &quot;This kind of micro-targeting is vital because it helps turn people from passive, captured audiences to identified, active participants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But strategists in both parties warn that the approach has limits. Peter Daou, a digital media strategist who worked for John F. Kerry's and Hillary Rodham Clinton's Democratic presidential campaigns, said there's a danger of losing sight of the broader themes and voter-organizing efforts needed to win elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of this can be taken a little too far, because the macro environment is always going to override the narrow interests of various voters,&quot; Daou said. &quot;Once you're getting down to pet lovers, I have a feeling that the bigger issues will override any of the work you do there. It can help on the margins, but that's about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the pitfalls are clear on the Pet Lovers for Obama Facebook page, a mostly fluffy affair featuring dozens of photographs of dogs, cats and at least one goat wearing pro-Obama swag.But the page also has its share of detractors, including those urging animal lovers to vote against Obama, and recurring lists of dog-eating and dog-on-car jokes. &quot;Oh my God, just when I thought people couldn't be more shallow and lame, this pops up,&quot; one user wrote in a recent comment, adding that Obama is &quot;the worst president ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another called the page &quot;ridiculous.&quot; &quot;What next,&quot; they asked. &quot;Starlings for Obama . . . ?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preezy of the United Steezy is making me queasy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not troubled by President Obama's slow jam with Jimmy Fallon, who dubbed the commander in chief &quot;preezy&quot; during Obama's appearance on late-night TV. No, preezy is making me queasy because his nonstop campaigning is looking, well, sleazy - and his ad suggesting that Mitt Romney wouldn't have killed Osama bin Laden is just the beginning of it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a political culture that long ago surrendered to the permanent campaign, Obama has managed to take things to a whole new level. According to statistics compiled for a book to be published this summer, the president has already set a record for total first-term fundraisers - 191 - and that's only through March 6. Measured in terms of  events that benefit his reelection bid, Obama's total (inflated in part by relaxed fundraising rules) exceeds the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">combined</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> total of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just the gatherings officially categorized as campaign events. To a greater extent than his predecessors, Obama has used the trappings of his office to promote his reelection prospects even while handling taxpayer-funded business. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the same book, &quot;The Rise of the President's Permanent Campaign,&quot; by Naval Academy political scientist Brendan Doherty, Obama was the first commander in chief in at least 32 years to visit all of the presidential battleground states during his first year in office. He has kept that pace, devoting nearly half of his travel to 15 swing states that account for just over a third of the population.           The election is still six months away, but it's increasingly difficult to distinguish Obama's political events and speeches from the official ones.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the case on Monday, when he spoke to a group of trade-union leaders at the Washington Hilton. The event, the morning after he and Clinton made a joint fundraising appearance, was ostensibly an &quot;official&quot; speech to the AFL-CIO's building trades section. But it was a campaign rally in everything but name. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The audience members shouted out Obama's &quot;Yes, we can&quot; slogan and chanted, &quot;Four more years.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll take it,&quot; offered the president, who unloaded on congressional Republicans for not spending money on infrastructure projects. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time after time, the Republicans have gotten together and they've said no,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boo!&quot; the audience responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I sent them a jobs bill that would have put hundreds of thousands of construction workers back to work,&quot; he continued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boo!&quot; the audience repeated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went to the speaker's home town,&quot; Obama said, referring to a trip to House Speaker John Boehner's battleground state of Ohio, &quot;stood under a bridge that was crumbling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let him drive on it!&quot; somebody shouted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe he doesn't drive anymore,&quot; Obama joked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Predictably, Boehner has been complaining about the president's campaigning. He said Obama's team should &quot;pony up&quot; and reimburse taxpayers for trips to three colleges in swing states last week. Boehner called Obama's traveling &quot;pathetic.&quot; The Republican National Committee formally asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the president's travel.The Republicans will get nowhere with that, just as Democrats failed when they made similar complaints about George W. Bush. Rules separating the official and the political are flimsy, and even when a president's campaign reimburses the Treasury, it's for a tiny fraction of the cost, which includes $179,750 per hour to operate Air Force One. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fairness, it's not entirely clear what choice Obama has. As with his blessing of a super PAC after condemning such groups, the alternative is unilateral disarmament. Also, his fundraising total has been inflated by a rule change that allows him to hold events that jointly benefit him and the Democratic Party (although his total number of fundraising appearances still eclipses that of each recent predecessor). Republicans, meanwhile, are determined to block the president's agenda, so it's an effective use of time to campaign for their defeat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Obama's acquiescence to an intolerable status quo raises a question: Shouldn't presidential leadership be about setting an example? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he is erasing the already blurred lines between campaigning and governing. During his &quot;official&quot; speech to the union group Monday, he hailed Tim Kaine as &quot;the next United States senator from the great commonwealth of Virginia,&quot; and his partisan speech spurred audience members to shouts of &quot;Vote 'em out!&quot; and &quot;Gotta throw 'em out!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not everything should be subject to thinking about the next election instead of thinking about the next generation,&quot; Obama said of the Republicans. &quot;Not everything should be subject to politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He should follow his own advice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has unleashed a particularly unusual fundraiser for his 2012 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Internet ad starts with a two-toned blue background, like dozens of other pro-Obama spots. Then the furry star pops into the frame, tongue out and ready to frolic. &quot;Join Pet Lovers for Obama,&quot; the ad implores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unlikely pitchman is Bo, the White House family pet, who may well be the first &quot;first dog&quot; to emerge as a central player in a presidential reelection campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political pets have long attracted inordinate attention, from then-Sen. Richard M. Nixon's dog, Checkers - the focus of an early 1950s scandal that slowed his political ascent - to Bill Clinton's adopted stray cat, Socks. In 2004, George W. Bush's campaign put together a tongue-in-cheek video for the Republican National Convention seeking advice from Barney, Bush's Scottish terrier, on how to attract the &quot;canine vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama appears to be breaking ground by featuring his Portuguese water dog so prominently in official campaign advertisements and fundraising efforts, part of a broader focus on the president's family. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boo!&quot; the audience responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I sent them a jobs bill that would have put hundreds of thousands of construction workers back to work,&quot; he continued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boo!&quot; the audience repeated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went to the speaker's home town,&quot; Obama said, referring to a trip to House Speaker John Boehner's battleground state of Ohio, &quot;stood under a bridge that was crumbling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let him drive on it!&quot; somebody shouted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe he doesn't drive anymore,&quot; Obama joked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Predictably, Boehner has been complaining about the president's campaigning. He said Obama's team should &quot;pony up&quot; and reimburse taxpayers for trips to three colleges in swing states last week. Boehner called Obama's traveling &quot;pathetic.&quot; The Republican National Committee formally asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the president's travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans will get nowhere with that, just as Democrats failed when they made similar complaints about George W. Bush. Rules separating the official and the political are flimsy, and even when a president's campaign reimburses the Treasury, it's for a tiny fraction of the cost, which includes $179,750 per hour to operate Air Force One. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fairness, it's not entirely clear what choice Obama has. As with his blessing of a super PAC after condemning such groups, the alternative is unilateral disarmament. Also, his fundraising total has been inflated by a rule change that allows him to hold events that jointly benefit him and the Democratic Party (although his total number of fundraising appearances still eclipses that of each recent predecessor). Republicans, meanwhile, are determined to block the president's agenda, so it's an effective use of time to campaign for their defeat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Obama's acquiescence to an intolerable status quo raises a question: Shouldn't presidential leadership be about setting an example? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he is erasing the already blurred lines between campaigning and governing. During his &quot;official&quot; speech to the union group Monday, he hailed Tim Kaine as &quot;the next United States senator from the great commonwealth of Virginia,&quot; and his partisan speech spurred audience members to shouts of &quot;Vote 'em out!&quot; and &quot;Gotta throw 'em out!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not everything should be subject to thinking about the next election instead of thinking about the next generation,&quot; Obama said of the Republicans. &quot;Not everything should be subject to politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He should follow his own advice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&quot;Even Jimmy Carter would have given that order,&quot; Mitt Romney says. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3:04 p.m. | Updated PORTSMOUTH, N.H.&nbsp; -- Mitt Romney said on Monday that &quot;even Jimmy Carter&quot; would have given the order to kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan a year ago, dismissing pointed questions by President Obama's re-election campaign about whether Mr. Romney would have issued the same command the president did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by reporters after a rally here whether he would have given the same military order as President Obama, Mr. Romney replied, &quot;Of course, of course,&quot; before taking a jab at Mr. Obama and Mr. Carter, the former Democratic president known for his longtime work promoting peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even Jimmy Carter would have given that order,&quot; Mr. Romney said as he greeted voters on a rope line here after a speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign has produced a stark commercial that raises questions about whether Mr. Romney would have followed the same course as the president, who ordered the attack on Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan one year ago this week, despite objections from some of the president's senior military advisers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, a campaign adviser to Mr. Obama, Robert Gibbs, reiterated that criticism of Mr. Romney during an appearance on &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I don't think it's clear that he would&quot; have given the order, Mr. Gibbs said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By referring to Mr. Carter, the Romney campaign is tying President Obama to a previous Democratic president considered by many to be weak on national security issues. But the comparison is somewhat flawed, given that while the signature military raid Mr. Carter ordered -- to rescue United States Embassy hostages in Tehran in 1980 -- was a failure,&nbsp;the raid Mr. Obama ordered against Bin Laden was a success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In making an issue of Mr. Romney's theoretical handling of the terrorist, the Obama campaign has been seizing on a 2007 quote by the candidateabout going after Bin Laden, in which he said, &quot;It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a few days later Mr. Romney said of Bin Laden, &quot;He will die.&quot; And after the raid, Mr. Romney praised both the troops involved in the operation and Mr. Obama for his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a news conference Monday with the Japanese prime minister, Mr. Obama accused Mr. Romney of flip-flopping on the question of whether he would have pursued Osama bin Laden, telling reporters -- without mentioning Mr. Romney by name -- that &quot;I assume that people meant what they said when they said it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama urged people to look at Mr. Romney's past statements as they assess his current ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said I'd go after Bin Laden if we had a clear shot at him. And I did,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;If there are others who have said one thing and now suggest they'd do something else, then I'd let them go ahead and explain it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of how -- and whether -- to use the death of Bin Laden in the context of a presidential campaign is fraught with emotional and politically sensitive baggage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. Romney said over the weekend that they thought it was unseemly for Mr. Obama's campaign to have been highlighting the raid, accusing them of turning a nonpartisan victory in the war on terror into a crass, political ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama on Monday rejected the suggestion that his administration or his campaign had been treating the subject with anything but the seriousness that it deserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hardly think that you've seen any excessive celebration taking place here,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;The American people rightly remember what we as a country accomplished in bringing to justice somebody who killed over 3,000 of our citizens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;For us to use that time for some reflection, to give thanks to those who participated, is entirely appropriate and that's what's been taking place.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The video, called &quot;Forward,&quot; opens with a red line heading sharply downward during 2008, ending with the words &quot;4.4 million jobs lost.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, senior White House aides have been privately banking on a chart of monthly job losses and gains that shows steep declines during President George W. Bush's last year in office and sharp improvement under President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chart-- shared widely online by Mr. Obama's allies and on the president's Facebook page -- shows the 2008 job losses in Republican red and the later employment gains in Democratic blue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Mr. Obama's campaign is going one step further in a Web video that animates the chart's decline during Mr. Bush's last year in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video, called &quot;Forward,&quot;  opens with a red line heading sharply downward during 2008, narrated by dire news reports of the economic collapse. In the last year of Mr. Bush's tenure, &quot;Foreclosures spike 112 percent,&quot; &quot;Lehman Brothers goes bankrupt,&quot; &quot;Dow plunges 778 points,&quot; &quot;unemployment at 26-year high.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2008 red line ends at the bottom with the words &quot;4.4 million jobs lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's seven-minute video goes on to document what the president's advisers insist is a sharp turnaround. But it is the first 38 seconds that signal one of the fundamental arguments of the president's re-election campaign as he prepares to battle Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case Mr. Obama is making is one of timing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wants voters to view his presidency through a wide lens that includes the last year of his predecessor's term. From that broader perspective, Mr. Obama argues, the economic recovery looks more profound -- and it happened on his watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the day Barack Obama took office, America had already lost 4.2 million jobs,&quot; the narrator of the video says. &quot;An economic disaster. The worst in a generation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign wants voters to pay attention to a different timeline altogether. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, Mr. Romney's advisers have been citing statistics that de-emphasize the economic collapse of 2008 and focus instead on the first few months of Mr. Obama's term, when the economic recovery had yet to take hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the stump, Mr. Romney often says that 92 percent of the job losses during Mr. Obama's tenure have been among women, a statistic that is true as far as it goes but ignores the job losses -- mostly by men -- during 2008 and the first month of 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chart that Mr. Obama's advisers like so much offers some help to Mr. Romney -- if voters look only at the part in blue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January, February, March and April 2009 were terrible months, with more than 700,000 jobs lost during each of those months. It was not until the spring of 2009 that the job losses fell sharply. And actual job growth did not start until the beginning of 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's advisers point out that the number of jobs lost during Mr. Obama's tenure is greater than the number gained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Has the gap gotten worse or better under Barack Obama? It's gotten worse,&quot; one of Mr. Romney's senior advisers said during a recent conversation. &quot;It's a statistical reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, as the president's advisers know, the picture for voters depends on what part of it they see. A picture that includes 2008 makes it easier for the president and his allies to make the case that it was Mr. Bush's policies that were in play during the first few months of 2009, not Mr. Obama's, which had largely not been passed and implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's new video largely skips over the first difficult months of his presidency, moving quickly to the months when the economy started improving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the last 25 months, 4.1 million new private-sector jobs,&quot; the narrator in the video says, showing a picture of the chart. &quot;And while there's still more to do, there's been real progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Republicans rally to unify behind the presumptive nominee Mitt Romney, the campaign's allies are working to heal old wounds from the bruising primary fight. In the latest example, the pro-Romney &quot;super PAC&quot; Restore Our Future has scrubbed its YouTube account of all negative ads against Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As noticed by Politico, the group's YouTube account now just has two advertisements: an attack on President Obama's job-creating credentials and a rehashing of a 2008 ad about Mr. Romney saving a young girl gone missing in New York City.  The former negative videos have been scrubbed from the group's channel and made private on individual ad pages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The super PAC had been one of the main attack dogs of the Romney primary campaign, critcizing Mr. Gingrich heavily in Iowa and Florida. The group then shifted its attacks to Mr. Santorum following his post-Iowa surge in the polls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign is expected to meet with Mr. Santorum this week to discuss a possible endorsement and ways in which the two former rivals can work together. Mr. Gingrich is expected to formally withdraw from the race this week.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             MADISON, Wis. - Wisconsin Democrats organized the protests that gripped the state. They turned Gov. Scott Walker's plans to strip public unions of their collective bargaining rights into a national Democratic cause. They got the signatures they needed to force a recall election, and then some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are now just over a month away from the big showdown with Walker they have been craving for more than a year - but rather than excitement, there is growing fear within the party that they just might blow it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem for Democrats is that before they get their shot against Walker, they have to get through a divisive primary between an establishment pick and a union favorite that is threatening to undercut their unified front against the Republican governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're nervous,&quot; said Julie Wells, who works with the grass-roots group United Wisconsin. Wells, a forklift operator from Fort Atkinson, filed the papers to recall Walker, and she was there when they were submitted. But now volunteers who promised to help aren't showing up. &quot;We know that we can win this, but we're not seeing the level of participation we saw during the signature-gathering phase,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, who lost to Walker by six percentage points in 2010, is the establishment pick for the May 8 Democratic primary. He leads three other primary candidates by double digits, according to the latest polls. He has the support of most prominent elected officials in the state and, in a sign of his standing, Republicans have focused their attacks on him.          &quot;The Republicans do not want me to emerge from this primary,&quot; Barrett told a crowd of 100 or so last week at a coffee shop in Waukesha. &quot;They've made commercials about several candidates,&quot; he said, and &quot;they're only running them against me.&quot;           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They view me as the strongest candidate,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most of the unions that first revolted against Walker's legislation have endorsed another candidate: former Dane County executive Kathleen Falk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many union leaders, Barrett is, if not as bad as Walker, not good enough, either. As mayor, he used the rule changes championed by Walker to take benefits away from city employees. While Falk committed to vetoing any budget that does not include collective bargaining, Barrett favors a more conciliatory special session of the legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, in particular, has aggressively attacked Barrett, at one point suggesting that he supported Walker's measures.          Falk argues that her candidacy better embodies Wisconsin's progressive tradition. &quot;I have the support of this movement,&quot; Falk said from her campaign headquarters in Madison, not far from the Capitol steps where the protests began. &quot;I have been here every step of the way.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falk got into the race in November and was there when the petitions were delivered. Barrett didn't declare his candidacy until late March. Falk's most recent ad declares that &quot;only one candidate&quot; in the race &quot;was there from the start.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet polls show Barrett is viewed more favorably than Falk and has higher name recognition. He has the support of prominent Democratic officials in the state, including Sen. Herb Kohl and former congressman David R. Obey, who said Wednesday that the Democratic infighting was a &quot;suicide pact.&quot;          Walker has suggested that Barrett is the tougher candidate. The state Senate's GOP leader, Scott Fitzgerald, has suggested that some Republicans will vote for Falk in the open primary, in an effort to give Walker a weaker opponent.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought it was premature&quot; for the unions to back Falk, said Joyce Gonis Schmitz, a retired school social worker who attended Barrett's event in Waukesha. &quot;That's reacting like an ADHD kid without meds. Let's be strategic here. Let's see who can beat Walker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falk's union supporters argue that the primary is good for the party in more ways than one. Not only is she &quot;the stronger candidate and the better candidate,&quot; said Rich Abelson, executive director of Wisconsin's AFSCME District Council 48, but a divided primary means Walker cannot focus all his attacks on one person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democrats in the state are not so sure. &quot;The unions could go out in a blaze of glory and take Barrett down two or three points that we need in the general election,&quot; said a top official of the recall movement who has not taken sides in the primary and would speak only on the condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Democrats can't quite unite, their opposition is both united and well funded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They set up this World Series event,&quot; Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said last week at an event in Arizona, &quot;and they didn't get the people that they wanted to run against Scott Walker. And so what they have are a couple people that have perfected the art of running for statewide elections and losing.&quot;In addition to Walker, his lieutenant governor and four Republican state senators face recall elections on June 5. (Democrats are more bullish on taking back the state Senate, where they need only one victory.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money to support them has poured in from conservatives all over the country who see Walker as a hero standing up to big labor. When the last fundraising reports were filed in January, Walker had raised more than $12 million. Falk had raised less than $17,000. Barrett wasn't in the race yet. Since January, Barrett has raised $750,000 and Falk $1 million. Walker has yet to release his latest haul.          &quot;Scott Walker will have more money than God,&quot; said Wisconsin Democratic Party spokesman Graeme Zielinski.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is not to say that Democrats are without resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Governors Association has sent $500,000 to Greater Wisconsin, an outside group that just launched its first ad, attacking Walker's jobs record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unions spent $12 million on the state Senate recalls last year and plan to spend at least that much this time. But Wisconsin For Falk, a union-backed political action committee, has already spent $4 million to boost its candidate - money that could have been used against Walker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent news gave Democrats some ammunition. Wisconsin lost 4,500 jobs in March, mostly in the private sector, leaving Walker with little progress on his campaign promise to create 250,000 jobs. He repealed the state's Equal Pay Enforcement Act, added new abortion restrictions and mandated sex education that stresses abstinence over contraception - all measures that play into Democrats' national mantra of a Republican &quot;war on women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all of the money and effort put into the recall effort, only 3 or 4 percent of voters are undecided about Walker and his policies. Republicans are as certain of Walker's courage and good sense as Democrats are of his perfidy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the primary campaign continues, polls show that independent voters are shifting to Walker. His approval ratings are higher than they were a year ago, although he's still below 50 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been waiting all this time, and now we get our day of reckoning,&quot; said Mahlon Mitchell, the president of the Professional Firefighters of Wisconsin. He's challenging Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch (R). &quot;If we win, its a huge win. It's huge.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior White House official said Sunday that President Obama wants to strike an &quot;appropriate balance&quot; in dealing with a Chinese dissident who fled house arrest last week and reportedly is under protection in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.          Comments by John O. Brennan, Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, were the closest the administration has come to confirming the whereabouts of dissident lawyer Chen Guangcheng and the difficulty the situation poses for U.S. policymakers.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president tries to &quot;balance our commitment to human rights&quot; with continuing &quot;to carry out our relationships with key countries overseas,&quot; Brennan said on &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot; &quot;We're going to make sure that we do this in the appropriate way and that appropriate balance is struck.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama &quot;has faced similar situations in the past in terms of this balancing requirement,&quot; Brennan said, and he &quot;will do whatever he thinks is in the best interest of the United States as well as the individuals involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the U.S. and Chinese governments have studiously avoided confirming Chen's whereabouts, adhering to uniform &quot;no information&quot; comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in a statement Sunday that he hopes the United States &quot;will take every measure to ensure that Chen and his family members are protected from further persecution.&quot; He said U.S. policy toward China must address human rights violations. &quot;Our country must play a strong role in urging reform in China and supporting those fighting for the freedoms we enjoy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident comes at a particularly dicey time for U.S.-China relations, on the heels of the appearance of a senior Chinese law enforcement official at the U.S. consulate in Chengdu with information that brought down a senior Communist Party boss, and on the eve of this week's visit to Beijing by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner for high-level talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kurt Campbell, the State Department's top diplomat for East Asia, appeared Sunday in Beijing on an unannounced trip, apparently to deal with the Chen situation in advance of Clinton's arrival. The State Department declined  even to confirm Campbell's presence in the Chinese capital, although he was photographed at a Beijing hotel early Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brennan made the rounds of three Sunday talk shows to mark the first anniversary of the U.S. Navy SEAL raid in Pakistan that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Although the administration had indicated that U.S. security was on heightened vigilance against a terrorist attack to mark the date, Brennan said on ABC's &quot;This Week&quot;: &quot;At this time, we don't see any active plot that is underway.&quot;          Bin Laden's death &quot;made a tremendous difference,&quot; he said. &quot;It's taken away the founding leader of that organization who was . . . a symbol of al-Qaeda's sort of murderous agenda worldwide.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although that and numerous  other gains have been made against the organization, he said, &quot;I don't look at it as a victory. I think . . . we have to destroy the organization. We have to take all of their operatives, their leaders, their training camps, take away their safe havens. And we're not going to rest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hosts on ABC, Fox and CNN's &quot;State of the Union&quot; tried to get Brennan to respond to an Obama campaign video suggesting that bin Laden might be alive today had Romney been president. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a Romney backer, called the ad &quot;a shameless end-zone dance to help [Obama] get reelected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brennan repeatedly refused the bait. &quot;I don't do politics,&quot; he told ABC. &quot;I don't do the campaign. I am not a Democrat or Republican. I'm a counterterrorism adviser to the president. All I know is that the president made the decision when he was given the opportunity to take a gutsy decision. . . . We're safer today as a result.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MADISON, WIS.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MADISON, Wis. - Wisconsin Democrats organized the protests that gripped the state. They turned Gov. Scott Walker's plans to strip public unions of their collective bargaining rights into a national Democratic cause. They got the signatures they needed to force a recall election, and then some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are now just over a month away from the big showdown with Walker they have been craving for more than a year - but rather than excitement, there is growing fear within the party that they just might blow it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem for Democrats is that before they get their shot against Walker, they have to get through a divisive primary between an establishment pick and a union favorite that is threatening to undercut their unified front against the Republican governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're nervous,&quot; said Julie Wells, who works with the grass-roots group United Wisconsin. Wells, a forklift operator from Fort Atkinson, filed the papers to recall Walker, and she was there when they were submitted. But now volunteers who promised to help aren't showing up. &quot;We know that we can win this, but we're not seeing the level of participation we saw during the signature-gathering phase,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, who lost to Walker by six percentage points in 2010, is the establishment pick for the May 8 Democratic primary. He leads three other primary candidates by double digits, according to the latest polls. He has the support of most prominent elected officials in the state and, in a sign of his standing, Republicans have focused their attacks on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans do not want me to emerge from this primary,&quot; Barrett told a crowd of 100 or so last week at a coffee shop in Waukesha. &quot;They've made commercials about several candidates,&quot; he said, and &quot;they're only running them against me.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They view me as the strongest candidate,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most of the unions that first revolted against Walker's legislation have endorsed another candidate: former Dane County executive Kathleen Falk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many union leaders, Barrett is, if not as bad as Walker, not good enough, either. As mayor, he used the rule changes championed by Walker to take benefits away from city employees. While Falk committed to vetoing any budget that does not include collective bargaining, Barrett favors a more conciliatory special session of the legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, in particular, has aggressively attacked Barrett, at one point suggesting that he supported Walker's measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falk argues that her candidacy better embodies Wisconsin's progressive tradition. &quot;I have the support of this movement,&quot; Falk said from her campaign headquarters in Madison, not far from the Capitol steps where the protests began. &quot;I have been here every step of the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falk got into the race in November and was there when the petitions were delivered. Barrett didn't declare his candidacy until late March. Falk's most recent ad declares that &quot;only one candidate&quot; in the race &quot;was there from the start.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet polls show Barrett is viewed more favorably than Falk and has higher name recognition. He has the support of prominent Democratic officials in the state, including Sen. Herb Kohl and former congressman David R. Obey, who said Wednesday that the Democratic infighting was a &quot;suicide pact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker has suggested that Barrett is the tougher candidate. The state Senate's GOP leader, Scott Fitzgerald, has suggested that some Republicans will vote for Falk in the open primary, in an effort to give Walker a weaker opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought it was premature&quot; for the unions to back Falk, said Joyce Gonis Schmitz, a retired school social worker who attended Barrett's event in Waukesha. &quot;That's reacting like an ADHD kid without meds.

Although the administration had indicated that U.S. security was on heightened vigilance against a terrorist attack to mark the date, Brennan said on ABC's &quot;This Week&quot;: &quot;At this time, we don't see any active plot that is underway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bin Laden's death &quot;made a tremendous difference,&quot; he said. &quot;It's taken away the founding leader of that organization who was . . . a symbol of al-Qaeda's sort of murderous agenda worldwide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although that and numerous  other gains have been made against the organization, he said, &quot;I don't look at it as a victory. I think . . . we have to destroy the organization. We have to take all of their operatives, their leaders, their training camps, take away their safe havens. And we're not going to rest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hosts on ABC, Fox and CNN's &quot;State of the Union&quot; tried to get Brennan to respond to an Obama campaign video suggesting that bin Laden might be alive today had Romney been president. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a Romney backer, called the ad &quot;a shameless end-zone dance to help [Obama] get reelected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brennan repeatedly refused the bait. &quot;I don't do politics,&quot; he told ABC. &quot;I don't do the campaign. I am not a Democrat or Republican. I'm a counterterrorism adviser to the president. All I know is that the president made the decision when he was given the opportunity to take a gutsy decision. . . . We're safer today as a result.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Obama poked fun at himself, Congress, the Secret Service, the media and particularly his rival Mitt Romney on Saturday night, mocking his Republican opponent as a fuddy-duddy rich guy who travels with his dog in a cage strapped to the roof of the family car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivering the traditionally comic remarks at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner, the president seemed to enjoy needling Mr. Romney just days after the general election contest effectively got underway. The highlight was a spoof Romney&nbsp;ad showing the former governor at the door of Air Force One with a dog cage on top of the aircraft. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Families are off limits, Mr. Obama declared. ''Dogs, however, are apparently fair game,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama pointed out that he was speaking in a cavernous hotel ballroom, or ''what Mitt Romney would call a little fixer-upper.'' He noted that he and Mr. Romney both have degrees from Harvard University, but the Republican has two. ''What a snob,'' Mr. Obama joked. And he said after his own appearance on Jimmy Fallon's show this week, Mr. Romney ''asked if he could get some equal time on 'The Merv Griffin Show.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing before the official entertainer of the evening, Jimmy Kimmel, Mr. Obama also took aim at a couple of other Republican critics. Noting the presence of Newt Gingrich, who plans to drop out of the Republican race next week, Mr. Obama called out, ''Newt there's still time, man!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he took aim at Sarah Palin, mocking her famous line from the 2008 convention as well as Republican criticism of him for eating dog meat while a boy in Indonesia. ''What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull?'' Mr. Obama asked. ''A pit bull is delicious.'' (Even Michelle Obama looked askance at that one.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He took a jab at Congress, thanking lawmakers who ''took a break from their exhausting schedule of not passing any laws to be here tonight.'' He teased Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was photographed dancing and drinking a beer at a club during a visit to Colombia. ''She won't stop drunk-texting me from Cartagena,'' the president said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And of course, he ribbed his own security detail after the prostitution scandal involving the Secret Service on that same trip to Colombia, declaring that he had to leave early because ''I have to get the Secret Service home in time for their new curfew.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kimmel also went after the Secret Service during his routine. ''I do have a lot of jokes about the Secret Service,'' he said. ''You know, I told them for $800 I wouldn't tell them, but they only offered 30.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dinner has long since morphed from a gathering of journalists and their sources into a peculiar ritual marrying Washington, New York and Hollywood cultures and celebrities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the president and the usual array of cabinet secretaries, senators, House members and television pundits, boldfaced names spotted at this year's dinner included George Clooney, Lindsay Lohan, Goldie Hawn, Claire Danes, Kim Kardashian, Diane Keaton and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just last year, the dinner played a cameo role in the raid that led to the death of Osama bin Laden. When he showed up at the dinner, Mr. Obama had just given the order for the helicopter incursion into Pakistan to burst into a compound where the Al Qaeda leader was suspected of living. But he smiled and joked his way through the dinner, and a ballroom full of journalists had no clue what was about to happen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doubtless you've heard plenty by now of President Obama's slow jam, which, for all you drips out there, refers to a rhythm-and-blues ballad or down-tempo song.

During a visit to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Obama and late-night comedian Jimmy Fallon pushed the president's plan to preserve low student-loan rates through a rhythmic rendering of his talking points set to music.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One could argue Obama's Fallon appearance was quite well done, which it was - for that sort of thing. The president played straight man and said or did nothing objectionable. He was, in a word, presidential, to the extent one can be under such circumstances. Even at the end when he said, &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; it was . . . cool. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the effect was nearly narcotic, so strange that cognitive dissonance doesn't quite describe it. One had the uneasy feeling that something wrong was happening. The lead grown-up isn't supposed to act that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, as we who argue with ourselves like to say, if you can get kids to learn multiplication tables by setting them to rap, why not push student-loan relief with a little R&amp;B? Maybe because you're the Preezy of the United Steezy? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Obama is a cool drink is no one's revelation. He's the ice tinkling in the glass. He's Muhammad Ali to Romney's, well, Romney. It's hard to come up with a more quintessential un-cool guy than the presumptive Republican nominee. What can you do? There's no book for cool, though if there were, Romney would have memorized and distilled it to a PowerPoint presentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then again, who really cares? Once you're beyond a certain age, cool becomes as attractive as a 60-year-old in jeggings. Young folks do get that you're not actually young or cool, nor do they really want you to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of us learned this lesson along that garden path called Parenthood. The cool parents might be fun for an overnight - you can get away with more - but it's nice to have a grown-up at home. Even the youth of America appreciate a grown-up in the White House. And though Obama is unfairly blessed with charm, pizazz and a natural athlete's grace, he does not benefit necessarily from playing well with comics. The line is extra fine between humorous and silly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Romney couldn't pull it off as well may be a surprise gift. He looked sadly uncomfortable while going through the paces with David Letterman, painfully reminiscent of Dustin Hoffman modeling scuba gear for his parents' cocktail party. Then again, that may have been the only way to play it. Serious adults don't do silly well.          The GOP is obviously mindful of the coolness gap and has issued a video ad in response to Obama's late-night foray titled &quot;A Tale of Two Leaders.&quot; The ad juxtaposes Obama's slow jam with Romney's general-election kickoff speech that is both earnest and heartfelt.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer should be obvious except for the fact that many consider the president grown-up enough. His play-alongs are just for fun, after all, though overplaying one's cool hand is risky as the very adult business of economic survival looms ever more ominously. A candidate's or an incumbent's popularity with the young will hardly assuage voter angst come November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Obama would do well to pay attention to another comedian whose gravitas may be greater than the president's among the late-night demographic. Said Comedy Central's Jon Stewart: &quot;You're the president. You don't have to do this [expletive] anymore.&quot;As for Romney, his safest bet is being proudly nerdy.

Then again, that may have been the only way to play it. Serious adults don't do silly well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP is obviously mindful of the coolness gap and has issued a video ad in response to Obama's late-night foray titled &quot;A Tale of Two Leaders.&quot; The ad juxtaposes Obama's slow jam with Romney's general-election kickoff speech that is both earnest and heartfelt. It does not hurt that Romney's voice at times could be mistaken for Ronald Reagan's. Implicit in the message (and the voice): Take your pick. Grown-up or cool dude?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer should be obvious except for the fact that many consider the president grown-up enough. His play-alongs are just for fun, after all, though overplaying one's cool hand is risky as the very adult business of economic survival looms ever more ominously. A candidate's or an incumbent's popularity with the young will hardly assuage voter angst come November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Obama would do well to pay attention to another comedian whose gravitas may be greater than the president's among the late-night demographic. Said Comedy Central's Jon Stewart: &quot;You're the president. You don't have to do this [expletive] anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Romney, his safest bet is being proudly nerdy. As the cool know too well, nerds usually win in the end.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Presidents running for re-election typically boast of programs they created, people they helped or laws they signed. They talk about rising test scores or falling deficits or expanding job rolls. President Obama is increasingly taking the unusual route of bragging about how he killed a man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, that man was Osama bin Laden, and he is not mourned among either the president's supporters or detractors. But in the days leading up to the first anniversary of the raid that finally caught up to the Qaeda mastermind, Mr. Obama has made a concerted, if to some indecorous, effort to trumpet the killing as perhaps the central accomplishment of his presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has used the rarefied setting of the Situation Room to give an interview about how he made the decision to send in Special Operations forces. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. gave a speech saying the re-election slogan would be ''Bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive.'' The president's campaign released a Web video showing former President Bill Clinton praising Mr. Obama's fortitude, as it questioned whether Mitt Romney would have made the same decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other presidents have boasted of their toughness, of course, notably Mr. Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, who campaigned for re-election in 2004 on a record of having deposed Saddam Hussein in Iraq, while his vice president, Dick Cheney, warned that electing John Kerry could lead to a terrorist attack. But few presidents have talked about the killing of an individual enemy in such an expansive way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt, the raid on a house in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a year ago Tuesday is a more favorable story for the president politically than the latest report showing slowing economic growth. With the general election effectively under way, it is part of an effort by both sides to define Mr. Obama's presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator John McCain of Arizona, Mr. Obama's Republican opponent four years ago, lashed out at the Web video, saying the president was turning ''the one decision he got right into a pathetic, political act of self-congratulation.'' He added, ''Shame on Barack Obama for diminishing the memory of September 11th and the killing of Osama bin Laden by turning it into a cheap political attack ad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heading into a weekend in which Mr. Obama will appear with the comedian Jimmy Kimmel before a star-studded crowd at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, Mr. Romney and his allies once again tried to turn Mr. Obama's own celebrity against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Web video released this week by American Crossroads, a Republican ''super PAC,'' made the case that the president's focus on image had preoccupied him from more important issues, mocking his mingling with the stars, including his ''slow-jamming the news'' with Jimmy Fallon on ''Late Night'' this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Four years ago, America elected the biggest celebrity in the world, and Americans got one cool president,'' the video says amid grim images and statistics on out-of-work recent college graduates. ''But after four years of a celebrity president, is your life any better?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney team amplified the message on Friday in a memorandum from the campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, arguing that Mr. Obama was counting on ''his winning TV persona'' for re-election. ''This election will be decided by adults casting their ballots in their precincts, not teenagers texting votes from in front of their television sets,'' Mr. Rhoades wrote. ''That apparently frightens the president and his advisers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contrast between the two campaign videos could not be starker. Set to ominous music and narrated by Mr. Clinton, the Bin Laden video describes the life-or-death stakes that confronted Mr. Obama and shows him standing silhouetted in front of an Oval Office window, shouldering the burdens of a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad then presents Mr. Romney as if he were the one not ready to lead, saying, ''Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claiming public credit for national security victories has long been a balancing act for presidents. Mr. Bush was criticized when a Republican ad showed pictures of ground zero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has been finding ways of talking about the Bin Laden raid for months. When a reporter asked in December about charges that he was appeasing the nation's enemies, Mr. Obama offered a strikingly blunt retort. ''Ask Osama bin Laden and the 22 out of 30 top Al Qaeda leaders who have been taken off the field whether I engage in appeasement,'' he said. ''Or whoever's left out there about that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then cited his leadership in the Bin Laden raid both in the opening passages of his State of the Union address in January and again in the closing sections, always making sure to credit the military and intelligence agencies. But the focus has intensified with the approach of the anniversary. On Thursday, he gave an interview to Brian Williams of NBC News in the Situation Room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Fratto, a deputy press secretary under Mr. Bush, said that it was ''unseemly'' to use the room for such a purpose. ''I don't believe it ever would have occurred to us to conduct an interview in the Situation Room,'' he said, ''and don't believe we would have considered it appropriate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joshua Earnest, Mr. Obama's deputy press secretary, said the White House was responding to news media requests. ''There certainly is interest around the one-year anniversary, so I'd be surprised if nobody asked about it in the context of the one-year anniversary,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martha Joynt Kumar, a Towson University specialist in presidential communication, said it was not surprising that Mr. Obama would use the Situation Room to argue his case. ''When they are running for re-election, presidents favor discussions of their successes,'' she said. ''The killing of Bin Laden is a natural item for President Obama to highlight.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anniversary has rekindled some of the longstanding debates about the methods that Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama have used to combat terrorism. Jose A. Rodriguez Jr., a former top Central Intelligence Agency official, defended the harsh interrogations of prisoners under Mr. Bush by contrasting them with Mr. Obama's use of drones to kill suspected terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''How could it be more ethical to kill people rather than capture them?'' he asked in a segment taped for Sunday's episode of ''60 Minutes'' on CBS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official familiar with a still-incomplete investigation by the Democratic staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee said the evidence did not support Mr. Rodriguez's assertion that the rough methods, widely condemned as torture, were necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             FORT STEWART, Ga. - President Obama, emphasizing his role as commander in chief, released a campaign video on Friday that heralds the administration's successfulattack on Osama bin Laden last year and questions whether Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney would have pursued the same course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the video, titled &quot;One Chance,&quot; former president Bill Clinton praises the &quot;decider-in-chief&quot; for ordering the Navy SEAL raid on bin Laden's compound. The one-year anniversary of the raid is next week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?&quot; the ad asks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 2008 campaign, the video notes, Romney criticized Obama for promising to consider drone strikes in Pakistan and said of bin Laden: &quot;It's not worth moving heaven and earth, spending billions of dollars, just trying to catch one person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new message, seeking to exploit Obama's national security credentials, came as the president addressed thousands of uniformed members of the Army's 3rd Infantry Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also signed an executive order cracking down on for-profit colleges that prey on service members. At the same time, Romney met with students in Ohio to discuss college debt and warn that the United States is &quot;on track to becoming Greece&quot; - the latest sign that the general election is kicking off with a focus on the concerns of young voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measure Obama signed is aimed at preventing schools from collecting tuition dollars from veterans without providing meaningful education in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joined by first lady Michelle Obama, Obama told some 10,300 soldiers that for-profit schools swindle veterans, harassing them with repeated phone calls and e-mails and promising them job placement without delivering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told of one college recruiter who visited a barracks at Camp Lejeune and signed up troops suffering from brain injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's appalling. That's disgraceful. That should never happen in America,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive order, he said, will &quot;make life a whole lot more secure for you and your families and our veterans and a whole lot tougher for those who try to prey on you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to trademark the term &quot;GI Bill,&quot; to make it easier for the government to crack down on for-profit groups that deceptively use the term to enroll veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also require the 6,000 colleges that participate in the GI Bill to provide veterans a &quot;Know Before You Owe&quot; document that more transparently explains how much debt they will take on to complete their degree. It will make it easier for service members to register complaints and for implicated institutions to be kept off of military installations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post Co. operates for-profit schools through its Kaplan subsidiary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's action was praised by veterans groups, although the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities called it &quot;deeply unfortunate,&quot; saying that it was already in talks with veterans organizations and lawmakers about the concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after Obama signed the executive order, Romney addressed a crowd of several hundred students and faculty members at Otterbein University, a small liberal arts college northeast of Columbus, Ohio. He delivered a 40-minute speech, flanked by about 50 students who listened respectfully - if not with overwhelming enthusiasm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney charged that Obama has been responsible for &quot;the most anemic and tepid recovery we've seen since Hoover&quot; and told students that when they listen to candidates they should &quot;consider not just the brilliance of their words but also the facts of their record and of what they've done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You will hear words from people running for office that sound great, but sometimes what people say is not a perfect example of what they're going to do,&quot; he said.&quot;Sometimes, appearances do not conform with the facts or reality or track records.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney counseled students to pay attention to the country's ballooning debt. &quot;There is no doubt in my mind that if this president were to be reelected, we will ultimately face a Greece-like setting, where people will wonder whether they want to loan money to America, and loan money to America at low interest rates,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beforehand, Romney and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) huddled with seven students over burgers and soft drinks to talk about their post-college prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, who studied English as an undergraduate, appeared to warn students against pursuing an English degree without further graduate study. &quot;As an English major, your options are - you'd better go to graduate school and find a job from there,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related move, the Republican-led House on Friday adopted a GOP-authored plan to pay for lower student rates with money set aside for preventative health care programs in the federal health-care overhaul. The White House has pledged to veto the proposal, which is unlikely to be taken up by the Democratic-led Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dueling events came on the heels of an appearance this week by the president on Jimmy Fallon's late-night talk show as well as a three-state college-campus swing during which he urged Congress to pass a plan to freeze federal student loan rates. Romney on Monday joined Obama in throwing his weight behind the goal of freezing loan rates, although he has not specified how he would like to see the cost of the freeze offset.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORT STEWART, GA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORT STEWART, Ga. - President Obama, emphasizing his role as commander in chief, released a campaign video on Friday that heralds the administration's successfulattack on Osama bin Laden last year and questions whether Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney would have pursued the same course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the video, titled &quot;One Chance,&quot; former president Bill Clinton praises the &quot;decider-in-chief&quot; for ordering the Navy SEAL raid on bin Laden's compound. The one-year anniversary of the raid is next week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?&quot; the ad asks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 2008 campaign, the video notes, Romney criticized Obama for promising to consider drone strikes in Pakistan and said of bin Laden: &quot;It's not worth moving heaven and earth, spending billions of dollars, just trying to catch one person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new message, seeking to exploit Obama's national security credentials, came as the president addressed thousands of uniformed members of the Army's 3rd Infantry Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also signed an executive order cracking down on for-profit colleges that prey on service members. At the same time, Romney met with students in Ohio to discuss college debt and warn that the United States is &quot;on track to becoming Greece&quot; - the latest sign that the general election is kicking off with a focus on the concerns of young voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measure Obama signed is aimed at preventing schools from collecting tuition dollars from veterans without providing meaningful education in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joined by first lady Michelle Obama, Obama told some 10,300 soldiers that for-profit schools swindle veterans, harassing them with repeated phone calls and e-mails and promising them job placement without delivering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told of one college recruiter who visited a barracks at Camp Lejeune and signed up troops suffering from brain injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's appalling. That's disgraceful. That should never happen in America,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive order, he said, will &quot;make life a whole lot more secure for you and your families and our veterans and a whole lot tougher for those who try to prey on you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to trademark the term &quot;GI Bill,&quot; to make it easier for the government to crack down on for-profit groups that deceptively use the term to enroll veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also require the 6,000 colleges that participate in the GI Bill to provide veterans a &quot;Know Before You Owe&quot; document that more transparently explains how much debt they will take on to complete their degree. It will make it easier for service members to register complaints and for implicated institutions to be kept off of military installations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post Co. operates for-profit schools through its Kaplan subsidiary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's action was praised by veterans groups, although the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities called it &quot;deeply unfortunate,&quot; saying that it was already in talks with veterans organizations and lawmakers about the concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after Obama signed the executive order, Romney addressed a crowd of several hundred students and faculty members at Otterbein University, a small liberal arts college northeast of Columbus, Ohio. He delivered a 40-minute speech, flanked by about 50 students who listened respectfully - if not with overwhelming enthusiasm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney charged that Obama has been responsible for &quot;the most anemic and tepid recovery we've seen since Hoover&quot; and told students that when they listen to candidates they should &quot;consider not just the brilliance of their words but also the facts of their record and of what they've done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You will hear words from people running for office that sound great, but sometimes what people say is not a perfect example of what they're going to do,&quot; he said.&quot;Sometimes, appearances do not conform with the facts or reality or track records.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney counseled students to pay attention to the country's ballooning debt. &quot;There is no doubt in my mind that if this president were to be reelected, we will ultimately face a Greece-like setting, where people will wonder whether they want to loan money to America, and loan money to America at low interest rates,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beforehand, Romney and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) huddled with seven students over burgers and soft drinks to talk about their post-college prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, who studied English as an undergraduate, appeared to warn students against pursuing an English degree without further graduate study. &quot;As an English major, your options are - you'd better go to graduate school and find a job from there,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related move, the Republican-led House on Friday adopted a GOP-authored plan to pay for lower student rates with money set aside for preventative health care programs in the federal health-care overhaul. The White House has pledged to veto the proposal, which is unlikely to be taken up by the Democratic-led Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dueling events came on the heels of an appearance this week by the president on Jimmy Fallon's late-night talk show as well as a three-state college-campus swing during which he urged Congress to pass a plan to freeze federal student loan rates. Romney on Monday joined Obama in throwing his weight behind the goal of freezing loan rates, although he has not specified how he would like to see the cost of the freeze offset.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;For months, President Obama has been making his case for greater economic fairness. But now it is clear Mitt Romney is not about to cede the fairness issue. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, President Obama has been making the case for what he calls the &quot;American values of fair play&quot; and accusing Republicans of pushing policies that unfairly benefit the rich over the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message is at the core of the campaign Mr. Obama's aides want to run against Mitt Romney, a man who they believe personifies the advantages wealthy people enjoy in an economy that has struggled for years to recover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now it's clear that Mr. Romney is not about to cede fairness to his rival. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new argument that he first offered in a primary victory speech on Tuesday, Mr. Romney is laying claim to his own version of the fairness issue. He argues that the policies pursued by Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies are fundamentally unfair to Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see an America with a growing middle class, with rising standards of living,&quot; he said, speaking in New Hampshire. &quot;This America is fundamentally fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as I look around at the millions of Americans without work, the graduates who can't get a job, the soldiers who return home to an unemployment line, it breaks my heart,&quot; Mr. Romney added. &quot;This does not have to be. It's the result of failed leadership and a faulty vision.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call it the clash of the fairness doctrines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama and his advisers are betting on the frustration that many Americans feel when they see the growing gap between the economic successes of the wealthy and the continuing struggles of the middle class. And they scoff at the idea that Mr. Romney might lay claim to a fairness argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a high regard for the American people,&quot; said David Axelrod, a senior strategist for Mr. Obama. &quot;I don't think that they are going to be ultimately taken in by rhetoric that completely contradicts the reality of who he is and what his program would do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with The Caucus, Mr. Axelrod said that Mr. Romney argues for a trickle-down economic policy that directly benefits the wealthy. He quipped that Mr. Romney's embrace of fairness reminded him of a line by George Burns: &quot;All you need to succeed in show business is sincerity, and if you can fake that, you got it made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He can moralize about those things,&quot; Mr. Axelrod said of Mr. Romney. &quot;But his records don't match.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies have spent much of the last several months trying to highlight the fairness issue. The president spoke about it in his State of the Union address in January. And Congress has debated Mr. Obama's &quot;Buffet Rule,&quot; which the president casts as a measure to address fairness in the tax code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich,&quot; Mr. Obama said to the joint session of Congress. &quot;It's because they understand that when I get a tax break I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Romney, in his New Hampshire speech, made it clear he is unwilling to let his rival own that issue. And his words suggested that he wants to redefine how the American public looks at the question of fairness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney assailed what he called the &quot;unfairness&quot; of a lack of school choice, contribution requirements for union workers, higher benefits for government workers and growing federal debt that will burden future generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will stop the unfairness of government workers getting better pay and benefits than the very taxpayers they serve,&quot; he said to loud applause. &quot;And -- and we will stop the unfairness of one generation passing larger and larger debts onto the next.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stuart Stevens, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, declined to discuss the specific thinking about the campaign's embrace of fairness as a new theme in Mr. Romney's speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he hinted that the new language would help Mr. Romney frame the next six months as a referendum on Mr. Obama's record in office and the impact on people's lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the beginning of an ongoing conversation where people are going to have to ask themselves do they believe that President Obama has accomplished what he set out to accomplish,&quot; Mr. Stevens said. &quot;Do they think their lives have improved?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Stevens said that efforts to dissect Mr. Romney's speech in New Hampshire was &quot;green room chatter&quot; that would not matter in the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Someone who just got a promotion, got a new house, got a new car, and is able to tell their kid that they can go to college - that person is someone that believes that life is going in a positive direction,&quot; Mr. Stevens said. &quot;Unfortunately, there are a lot fewer of those people because of Barack Obama's policies and his failure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither campaign seems willing to give an inch on the question of which candidate would better address the sense of unfairness among the middle class. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That suggests that the debate will intensify during the next six months as Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama both fight over how to define fairness in the context of the country's economic crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whichever candidate wins that rhetorical battle may have the upper hand in convincing voters to turn out for him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mitt Romney and his Republican allies are once again trying to turn Mr. Obama's celebrity against him, suggesting that what the country needs now are serious, somber solutions, not a happy crooner. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney wants you to believe he will face one cool cat in November - a Ray-Ban-wearing, slow-news-jamming, smooth-as-silk singing Oval Office incumbent who regularly fills up stadiums with swooning students chanting his name: O-bam-a! O-bam-a!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heading into a weekend where Mr. Obama will appear with comedian Jimmy Kimmel before a star-studded crowd at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, Mr. Romney and his Republican allies are once again trying to turn Mr. Obama's celebrity against him, suggesting that what the country needs now are serious, somber solutions, not a happy crooner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Web video released this week by American Crossroads, a Republican &quot;super PAC,&quot; mocks Mr. Obama's penchant for mingling with the stars, including a recent visit with Jimmy Fallon on &quot;Late Night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Four years ago, America elected the biggest celebrity in the word, and Americans got one cool president,&quot; the video says before showing grim images and statistics of out-of-work college students. &quot;But after four years of a celebrity president, is your life any better?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video is a sequel to an ad that Senator John McCain's campaign tried four years ago. Faced with Mr. Obama's soaring popularity, Mr. McCain's campaign mixed images of Mr. Obama with Paris Hilton and others, calling him the world's biggest celebrity, but asking &quot;Is he ready to lead?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the Republican establishment and Mr. Romney's campaign appear to be on the same page. A memo from Matt Rhoades, Mr. Romney's campaign manager, on Friday morning argues that Mr. Obama is counting on &quot;his winning TV persona&quot; for re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This election will be decided by adults casting their ballots in their precincts, not teenagers texting votes from in front of their television sets,&quot; Mr. Rhoades wrote. &quot;That apparently frightens the president and his advisers right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Mr. Obama's campaign declined to comment. But the campaign on Friday released a striking new video about Mr. Obama's decision to order the killing of Osama bin Laden last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set to ominous music and narrated by former President Bill Clinton, the video describes the portentous decision and life-or-death risks that faced Mr. Obama and asks the question whether Mr. Romney would have done the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video serves as a counter to the glitzy, fluffy images of Mr. Obama in the Crossroads video. Instead, Mr. Obama is shown as so many other presidents have been - standing silhouetted in front of one of the Oval Office windows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats also responded quickly to the statistics in the Crossroads ad. A memo from the Democratic National Committee called them &quot;misleading attacks&quot; that won't help Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has worked to make college more affordable and create more and better-paying employment opportunities for younger Americans,&quot; the committee said. &quot;Mitt Romney, on the other hand, has offered nothing but lip service and dishonest attacks on the president's record to young voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort by the Republican is basically an attempt to portray Mr. Obama as an unserious politician operating in extremely serious times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will it work? Aides to Mr. McCain believed four years ago that their ad helped to raise doubts about Mr. Obama's leadership. Privately, they said at the time that Mr. McCain's polling improved after the ad was released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama was more of a blank slate at the time. Since then, Americans have had more direct exposure to Mr. Obama as president and commander in chief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, after three and a half years, Republicans are counting on the fact that voters - and especially young voters - will be put off by the clash of those images with the less serious ones.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as they do every year, the famous officials, journalists and Hollywood stars will gather Saturday night at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner for an odd mix of celebrity and wonkdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And just as it is every year, it will probably not be the highlight of the<BR>president's week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since long before Barack Obama arrived in the Oval Office, presidents have dreaded and regretted the correspondents' dinner and its various cousins. They are sprawling affairs that drag on long into the night and require the president to sit with a forced smile as he endures socializing with the very people who spend their days tormenting him. He shakes the hands of journalists who have just won awards for work that, quite often, pokes holes in his presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boy, it's a pleasure to know it's over, it really is,&quot; Richard M. Nixon confided in H. R. Haldeman, his chief of staff, after one such dinner in 1971. &quot;I've done it for so many years. Hated every one of them. You know, by God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nixon spoke for many of his successors, according to a review of oral histories by researchers at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He hated those things,&quot; David F. Demarest Jr., who was the elder George  Bush's communications director, told the Miller Center about his boss. &quot;And he would say to me, 'I'm not goddamned Johnny Carson.' I would say to him, 'Mr. President, you're actually a pretty funny guy. You really are. We'll work with you to try to let that come out, but you are funny.' And he is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Demarest said Mr. Bush had a mischievous side. &quot;He's got a great sense of humor, but he hated being cast in a role that he didn't think he could measure up to,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerald Rafshoon, who was communications director for Jimmy Carter, made clear that his boss was no more enamored of the ritual. &quot;He didn't like to go to these White House correspondents' dinners and Gridiron, and Jody and I used to have to fight him,&quot; he said, referring to Jody Powell, the press secretary. &quot;He said, 'Well, because that takes a day of preparation at least, and then I have to do it and I have to practice and everything.' I said, 'But you do it so well, Mr. President.' He said, 'Yes, but there are more important things to do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Note how presidential aides of both parties flatter their bosses with how funny they are. For the record, asked whether Mr. Obama enjoyed the dinners, his spokesman, Josh Earnest, politely said that he respects the role of a free press and does enjoy giving his own speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mitt Romney recounts two success stories - Jimmy John's and Papa John's -- to college students in Ohio. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WESTERVILLE, Ohio - This is the story of two John's - Jimmy John's and Papa John's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both have made it big in the fast food world. Mitt Romney, it turns out, has met both of them. And he likes their stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because their stories are a bit like his own (in some respects, anyway). They are entrepreneurs - and, usefully, they are emblems of the economic opportunity in America that Mr. Romney highlights in just about every campaign speech he delivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday afternoon here, Mr. Romney recounted their tales during a guest lecture to students at  Otterbein University, a private liberal arts college in suburban Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney started with Jimmy John, the founder of Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He graduated from high school and he didn't want to go to college,&quot; Mr. Romney said. &quot;And he said to his dad, can I borrow some money, I want to start a business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father was skeptical, but he loaned him $20,000. &quot;The only thing that would work for $20,000 was a sandwich shop, so he started making sandwiches,&quot; Mr. Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest, Mr. Romney said, is more or less history. His outfit went national. &quot;His sandwiches are doing pretty well,&quot; Mr. Romney said, chuckling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney encouraged the students in the room to follow Mr. John's path. &quot;Take, take a shot, go for it. Take a risk. Get the education. Borrow money if you have to from your parents. Start a business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This led, naturally, to the second John. &quot;The other night I was with, another restaurant guy, Papa John,&quot; Mr. Romney said. He did not say how the two had met, but given Mr. Romney's heavy schedule of fundraisers these days, there is a strong chance it was at one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he said it was in 1966 he opened his first pizza restaurant and today employs thousands of people,&quot; Mr. Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We welcome that. We celebrate that in this country. It's one of the reasons we are the nation we are.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Before the Republicans define the president, the Obama camp is trying to remind voters he has accomplished some big things. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - By Monday morning, the newest skyscraper rising from the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks is expected to be the tallest building in New York's skyline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tower at One World Trade Center, at 1776 feet (541 meters) and 104 floors, will be 403 feet taller than the twin towers it is replacing.  When finished in 2013 or 2014, it will be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. The tallest building in the world will remain Dubai's Burj Khalifa in the United Arab Emirates, at 2,717 feet or 828 meters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next week could be a moment of triumph for Americans who, one year ago, were celebrating in the streets of Lower Manhattan and Washington, D.C. when President Barack Obama announced that Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind 9/11, had been killed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back then the Democratic president refused to do a victory dance, saying Americans didn't &quot;need to spike the football.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that was a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facing an onslaught of criticism from Republican rivals who try to paint him as a lightweight celebrity, the Obama White House and campaign are engaging in a media blitz meant to remind everyone who has been calling the shots on foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's aides enlisted former president Bill Clinton to narrate this web ad that suggests that Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, would not have pursued the Qaeda leader as aggressively.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Clinton's involvement in this ad reminded many of the fierce primary contest four years ago when Hillary Rodham Clinton, now Mr. Obama's Secretary of State, questioned his foreign policy credentials in her own national security ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Peter Baker and Michael D. Shear note in the Times, the president has actually been talking about Bin Laden for months - including in his State of the Union address. Only now the intensity has changed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama will be on national television on Wednesday, the anniversary of Bin Laden's death, doing part of the interview in The Situation Room. The president's aides have been interviewed for a Time Magazine special report, and there's much more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have seized upon Mr. Obama's reluctance to score political points with the death of Bin Laden last year. His 2008 opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona, called the new web ad &quot;shameless&quot; and &quot;pathetic.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is not only trying to score political points by invoking Osama bin Laden, he is doing a shameless end-zone dance to help himself get re-elected,&quot; Mr. McCain said. Romney campaign spokespeople accused the president of trying to divide the country.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Usually disciplined and on message, Mr. Obama rarely raised the issue, but when pushed he has reminded foes that he has tackled some big challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt the White House's attempt to capitalize on the anniversary of the Bin Laden death is meant to counter the Republican message that Mr. Obama has been an ineffectual and incompetent president who is out of his depth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normally, an April with the presidential candidates already decided, might slip into the political doldrums for a while. Not this year. Before the Republicans define the president in their terms, the Obama camp is trying to make it clear that he did accomplish some big things, despite the enduring economic malaise and the health care overhaul that is far less popular than they had expected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. gave a speech saying that the re-election slogan would be &quot;Bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive,&quot; referring to the car-company bailout orchestrated by the administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's opening salvo of his re-election campaign should not have caught Republicans by surprise. On Thursday night, Mr. Biden told an audience at New York University that Mr. Romney and the Republicans had ideas that were from another era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His boss, he said, talked softly but carried a big stick. &quot;I promise you, the president has a big stick. I promise you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, the danger of trumpeting foreign successes is that between now and the election in November there are any number of foreign challenges that could explode. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly all of the independent advertising being aired for the 2012 general-election campaign has come from interest groups that do not disclose their donors, suggesting that much of the political spending over the next six months will come from sources invisible to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politically active nonprofit groups that do not reveal their funding sources have spent $28.5 million on advertising related to the November presidential matchup, or about 90 percent of the total through Sunday, a Washington Post analysis shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the ad spending has come in swing states from conservative groups that criticize President Obama's policies, the data show. Secretive groups have spent tens of millions more targeting congressional races, again mainly in support of Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers signal a shift              away from super PACs, which are required to disclose their donors to the Federal Election Commission and which have overwhelmed spending in the Republican primary contest. Instead, the battle between Obama and presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney appears likely to be dominated by a shadow campaign run by big-spending nonprofits that do not have to identify their financial backers.          Under tax and election laws, most nonprofits, including many that spend money to run ads during election season, are not required to publicly reveal their donors, unlike more purely political groups.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pattern underscores the growing influence of corporations and wealthy individuals in the wake of a Supreme Court decision that made it easier to spend unlimited money on elections. The numbers also suggest that many well-off donors are increasingly opting for the confidentiality of nonprofits rather than allowing the public scrutiny that comes from giving to super PACs or candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there is a potential to see a tremendous amount of money flowing through these nonprofit groups,&quot; said Bill Allison, editorial director at the Sunlight Foundation, which advocates greater disclosure for political organizations and candidates. &quot;For an awful lot of donors, it's a very attractive way to give without leaving any kind of footprint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crossroads GPS, the largest of the independent pro-Republican groups, said it raised nearly $40 million from unidentified donors in the first three months of this year, compared with less than $10 million taken in by its affiliated super PAC, American Crossroads, which discloses contributors, according to documents and officials.           The Crossroads groups have run more than $12 million in anti-Obama ads this cycle, almost all of them paid for by the secretive nonprofit arm, according to data from Kantar Media/Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks ad spending. Recent tax records showed that 90 percent of the $76 million the nonprofit arm raised through 2011 came from unidentified donors who gave $1 million or more, including two who gave $10 million each.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the spots aired by groups such as Crossroads GPS are considered &quot;issue ads&quot; because they do not specifically urge viewers to vote for a particular candidate. The strategy allows them to conform to Internal Revenue Service rules for &quot;social welfare&quot; groups, which do not have to disclose their donors as long as their &quot;primary purpose&quot; is not politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             One Crossroads GPS spot currently running in Virginia, for example, castigates the president for high energy prices. &quot;No matter how Obama spins it, gas costs too much,&quot; the narrator says. &quot;Tell Obama: Stop blaming others and work to pass better energy policies.&quot;The ad, despite its anti-Obama message, is not explicitly for or against any candidate and so is not considered election-related under FEC and IRS guidelines. That means the money spent to air the spot - about $204,000 in the Richmond, Charlottesville and Washington markets - will not count as part of the group's political budget, experts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are still very early in the cycle, with virtually all of last year and the first quarter dedicated to framing legislative and regulatory issues with conservative messaging,&quot; said Jonathan Collegio, a spokesman for the Crossroads groups. &quot;As we approach the elections, more of our expenditures will be political and election-focused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post analysis included spending on ads since the start of the 2012 cycle that mentioned Obama or the general election, but not ads that were aired as part of the Republican primary contest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to spending by Crossroads, top expenditures on anti-Obama issue ads include $7 million from Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group with ties to oil billionaires Charles and David Koch; $3 million from the American Future Fund, a nonprofit conservative group based in Iowa; and at least $3.3 million from the American Energy Alliance, a group supported in part by the energy industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal groups have spent little in comparison. The Environmental Defense Fund and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees have each spent about $1.1 million on ads related to the presidential general election, the data show. Most of the money on the left, particularly from labor unions, is expected to be spent on grass-roots organizing rather than advertising. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Benjamin Cole, communications director for the American Energy Alliance, said the estimated $4 million that the group has spent on television, radio and Internet ads &quot;is just a fraction of what we're expecting to spend&quot; by November. He said the group is proud that it &quot;fired the jump ball for the general election&quot; with an ad running in 10 swing states that criticizes Obama's energy policies and warns of $9-a-gallon gasoline.          &quot;Almost overnight it became Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on energy,&quot; Cole said. &quot;There's no problem with that. We want the conversation about energy, and we're happy to keep that conversation going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, Cole said, the group's aims are primarily educational and nonpartisan. He noted that the group has criticized Romney, giving him its &quot;Dim Bulb Award&quot; last week for saying in 2003 that coal energy &quot;kills people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watchdog groups have long complained about a lack of disclosure by tax-exempt advocacy organizations, and Democrats have pushed for stronger requirements. Last month, a federal judge in Washington ordered the FEC to write tougher disclosure rules for nonprofits that run ads within 60 days of an election, but it's unclear whether the agency will act on the matter before November.Much of the advocacy spending related to the presidential election will go undocumented until 2013, when interest groups file their annual reports with the IRS. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Super PACs also have come under fire for transparency because many donations to the groups are from entities that are hard to trace. Restore Our Future, a pro-Romney super PAC that has raised $52 million, said it would revise its FEC disclosures this week after news organizations questioned a $400,000 donation linked to a defunct company address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokeswoman Brittany Gross said the listing was the result of a &quot;clerical error.&quot; She said the filing will be updated to show a pair of $200,000 contributions from Gerald and Darlene Jordan, who were hosts of a recent fundraiser for Romney at their home in Palm Beach, Fla.          </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly all of the independent advertising being aired for the 2012 general-election campaign has come from interest groups that do not disclose their donors, suggesting that much of the political spending over the next six months will come from sources invisible to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politically active nonprofit groups that do not reveal their funding sources have spent $28.5 million on advertising related to the November presidential matchup, or about 90 percent of the total through Sunday, a Washington Post analysis shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the ad spending has come in swing states from conservative groups that criticize President Obama's policies, the data show. Secretive groups have spent tens of millions more targeting congressional races, again mainly in support of Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers signal a shifthttp://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-money-is-funding-more-election-ads/2012/02/03/gIQAfTxEuQ_story.html&quot;                 title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com away from super PACs, which are required to disclose their donors to the Federal Election Commission and which have overwhelmed spending in the Republican primary contest. Instead, the battle between Obama and presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney appears likely to be dominated by a shadow campaign run by big-spending nonprofits that do not have to identify their financial backers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under tax and election laws, most nonprofits, including many that spend money to run ads during election season, are not required to publicly reveal their donors, unlike more purely political groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pattern underscores the growing influence of corporations and wealthy individuals in the wake of a Supreme Court decision that made it easier to spend unlimited money on elections. The numbers also suggest that many well-off donors are increasingly opting for the confidentiality of nonprofits rather than allowing the public scrutiny that comes from giving to super PACs or candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there is a potential to see a tremendous amount of money flowing through these nonprofit groups,&quot; said Bill Allison, editorial director at the Sunlight Foundation, which advocates greater disclosure for political organizations and candidates. &quot;For an awful lot of donors, it's a very attractive way to give without leaving any kind of footprint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crossroads GPS, the largest of the independent pro-Republican groups, said it raised nearly $40 million from unidentified donors in the first three months of this year, compared with less than $10 million taken in by its affiliated super PAC, American Crossroads, which discloses contributors, according to documents and officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Crossroads groups have run more than $12 million in anti-Obama ads this cycle, almost all of them paid for by the secretive nonprofit arm, according to data from Kantar Media/Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks ad spending. Recent tax records showed that 90 percent of the $76 million the nonprofit arm raised through 2011 came from unidentified donors who gave $1 million or more, including two who gave $10 million each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the spots aired by groups such as Crossroads GPS are considered &quot;issue ads&quot; because they do not specifically urge viewers to vote for a particular candidate. The strategy allows them to conform to Internal Revenue Service rules for &quot;social welfare&quot; groups, which do not have to disclose their donors as long as their &quot;primary purpose&quot; is not politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Crossroads GPS spot currently running in Virginia, for example, castigates the president for high energy prices. &quot;No matter how Obama spins it, gas costs too much,&quot; the narrator says. &quot;Tell Obama: Stop blaming others and work to pass better energy policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, despite its anti-Obama message, is not explicitly for or against any candidate and so is not considered election-related under FEC and IRS guidelines. That means the money spent to air the spot - about $204,000 in the Richmond, Charlottesville and Washington markets - will not count as part of the group's political budget, experts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are still very early in the cycle, with virtually all of last year and the first quarter dedicated to framing legislative and regulatory issues with conservative messaging,&quot; said Jonathan Collegio, a spokesman for the Crossroads groups. &quot;As we approach the elections, more of our expenditures will be political and election-focused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post analysis included spending on ads since the start of the 2012 cycle that mentioned Obama or the general election, but not ads that were aired as part of the Republican primary contest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to spending by Crossroads, top expenditures on anti-Obama issue ads include $7 million from Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group with ties to oil billionaires Charles and David Koch; $3 million from the American Future Fund, a nonprofit conservative group based in Iowa; and at least $3.3 million from the American Energy Alliance, a group supported in part by the energy industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal groups have spent little in comparison. The Environmental Defense Fund and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees have each spent about $1.1 million on ads related to the presidential general election, the data show. Most of the money on the left, particularly from labor unions, is expected to be spent on grass-roots organizing rather than advertising. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Cole, communications director for the American Energy Alliance, said the estimated $4 million that the group has spent on television, radio and Internet ads &quot;is just a fraction of what we're expecting to spend&quot; by November. He said the group is proud that it &quot;fired the jump ball for the general election&quot; with an ad running in 10 swing states that criticizes Obama's energy policies and warns of $9-a-gallon gasoline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Almost overnight it became Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on energy,&quot; Cole said. &quot;There's no problem with that. We want the conversation about energy, and we're happy to keep that conversation going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, Cole said, the group's aims are primarily educational and nonpartisan. He noted that the group has criticized Romney, giving him its &quot;Dim Bulb Award&quot; last week for saying in 2003 that coal energy &quot;kills people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watchdog groups have long complained about a lack of disclosure by tax-exempt advocacy organizations, and Democrats have pushed for stronger requirements. Last month, a federal judge in Washington ordered the FEC to write tougher disclosure rules for nonprofits that run ads within 60 days of an election, but it's unclear whether the agency will act on the matter before November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the advocacy spending related to the presidential election will go undocumented until 2013, when interest groups file their annual reports with the IRS. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Super PACs also have come under fire for transparency because many donations to the groups are from entities that are hard to trace. Restore Our Future, a pro-Romney super PAC that has raised $52 million, said it would revise its FEC disclosures this week after news organizations questioned a $400,000 donation linked to a defunct company address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokeswoman Brittany Gross said the listing was the result of a &quot;clerical error.&quot; She said the filing will be updated to show a pair of $200,000 contributions from Gerald and Darlene Jordan, who were hosts of a recent fundraiser for Romney at their home in Palm Beach, Fla.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A TV ad supporting President Obama responds to Republican attacks on high gasoline prices. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as Mitt Romney continues to assail President Obama on the price of gas at the pump, Democrats are pushing back by trying to tie Mr. Romney to oil companies and the wealthy interests behind them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new television ad financed by a &quot;super PAC&quot; backing Mr. Obama accuses Mr. Romney of being a &quot;$200 million man&quot; and says that &quot;Big Oil's fingerprints are all over him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is by Priorities USA Action, a pro-Obama super PAC, and the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental organization, and the groups are spending about $1 million to run it in Colorado and Nevada, according to people familiar with the effort. The ad will also run online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In it, images of Mr. Romney are partially obscured by black, oily fingerprints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big Oil's pledged $200 million to help Mitt Romney. And Romney's pledged to protect their profits and billions in special tax breaks,&quot; an announcer says. &quot;So when you fill up your tank, remember who's in the tank for Big Oil. Mitt Romney. The $200 million man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have seized on high gas prices this spring to criticize Mr. Obama. In his victory speech after Tuesday's primary elections, Mr. Romney mentioned high gas prices several times, at one point asking the audience: &quot;Are you paying less at the pump?&quot; The audience yelled, &quot;No!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democrats hope that they can tie oil companies reaping big profits to Republican candidates who have opposed the elimination of tax breaks for those companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, responded to the ad, saying that &quot;when Americans go to the pump, if they ask themselves if gas costs are a smaller or bigger part of their budget since President Obama took office, the answer will be that they're paying twice as much. President Obama and his allies will do whatever they can to try to deflect blame and cover up for Obama's failure to control gas prices.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW -- Critics of the Obama administration's thawed diplomatic policy toward Russia, known as the ''reset,'' say it has brought few concrete results. But this week, a visiting American trade delegation is promoting an economic benefit -- a doubling of exports of American car parts to Russia over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in sales is striking even compared with an overall rise in American exports to Russia, which the Commerce Department says were up about 40 percent last year, partly owing to trade rebounding after the recession. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aerospace and software companies are also doing well. Proponents of the reset point to the recent multibillion-dollar joint venture between Exxon Mobil, America's largest oil company, and Russia's state oil company, Rosneft, as another economic payoff of the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most American auto parts exported to Russia are put in new cars at assembly plants set up earlier by Ford, General Motors or European or Japanese competitors. But aftermarket sales are also rising. Reflecting the significant accomplishment of makers of gaskets, fenders and headlights, a deputy under secretary of commerce for international trade, Michelle O'Neill, led the delegation of 13 car parts companies to the Russian capital and two manufacturing regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Russians love American cars,'' Ms. O'Neill said. ''We think there is extraordinary opportunity for growth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization, expected this summer with American support, will require that Russia phase out local content rules for automotive assembly plants, further expanding the potential market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Congress must first grant Russia permanent normal trade relation status by repealing a cold war-era statute intended to liberalize emigration of religious minorities, the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, before American companies can take full advantage of the new rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists have noted for years that Russia and the United States have relatively little direct trade compared with the size of their economies -- a legacy of the superpower standoff and politics today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To improve economic ties as part of the reset that President Obama introduced in 2009, the Commerce Department established a committee on trade with Russia. Members identified car parts as a prospective market and worked to eliminate barriers to United States exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It has been a focused effort by the Obama administration to deepen commercial and economic relations,'' Ms. O'Neill said in an interview in Moscow on Monday. ''This is one of the fruits of that labor.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commerce Department said auto parts sales rose to $125.3 million in 2011 from $63.3 million in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matthew Edwards, the department's director of the office for trade with Russia and other former Soviet states, said mundane trade in items like car parts often goes unnoticed. ''Everybody likes to roll out an airliner,'' he said. ''But a lot of trade takes place on a less sexy level.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hoosier Gasket Corporation, of Indianapolis, is one company poised to sell more parts to Russia. As major manufacturers outsource more components while also assembling vehicles overseas, exports rise for parts makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's a domino effect,'' Oleg Gostomelsky, a vice president at Hoosier, who was on the delegation, said. ''Now, when Ford decides to come to Russia, as it has, it pulls a lot of companies with it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of the reset policy, though, say it has deflected attention from more fundamental American interests by playing down human rights abuse and backsliding on democracy in Russia under Vladimir V. Putin, who is set to begin a third presidential term in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, after Mr. Obama inadvertently spoke into an open microphone while discussing missile defense policy with Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney characterized Russia as ''without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it happens, car parts manufacturers are heavily represented in swing states like Ohio and Indiana, one explanation, perhaps, for careful attention to their industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation included representatives of Dana Holding of Maumee, Ohio; Bushwacker of Portland, Ore.; and Cyclo Industries of Jupiter, Fla.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- So long, flip-flopper. Hello, right-wing extremist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney may be inclined to start moving to the political center now that he's practically got the Republican nomination won and done, but the Obama campaign would much rather keep him right where he's been for the past few months: in the conservative territory he staked out while battling for Republican primary voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of depicting Mr. Romney as the ultimate squishy, double-talking, no-core soul, Team Obama is shifting gears. Senior administration officials, along with Democratic and campaign officials, all say their strategy now will be to tell the world that Mr. Romney has a core after all -- and it's deep red. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's overheard remarks at a fund-raiser in Florida on Sunday night that, if elected, he planned to slash government programs (though he has not spelled that out for the voters) gave Obama backers the perfect opening, and they jumped on it. ''Mitt Romney Tells Rich Voters His Secret Plan to Cut Housing Assistance,'' said a headline from ThinkProgress, a blog put out by the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Democratic officials followed that up with a call to reporters on Thursday charging that Mr. Romney's proposal would ''cut critical funds for homeless veterans.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mr. Obama's advisers saw another chance, and they were all over that, too. Hours after Mr. Romney accepted the endorsement of Gov. Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, the Democratic National Committee was out with an ad ''Mitt Romney and Tom Corbett: Too Extreme for Women.'' The traditional spooky music accompanies video of Mr. Corbett defending his advocacy of a proposal that could make women undergo ultrasounds before receiving abortions, and saying women could ''close their eyes'' if they didn't want to see what was on the screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Did Mitt Romney close his eyes to accept this endorsement?'' the D.N.C. said in an e-mail it helpfully sent to reporters trumpeting the advertisement. ''Probably not, since Mitt Romney's positions mirror those of the extreme elements of his party,'' the e-mail continued, going on to list a host of conservative Romney positions that Democrats hope will alienate women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Obama, the decision to start going after Mr. Romney from the left is as much a logical evolution as is any attempt by Mr. Romney to move to the center, in particular Mr. Romney's effort now to try to woo Hispanic and female voters who may have been alienated by some of the talk coming out of the Republican primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the general election heats up, a central battlefield promises to be the fights for suburban women in crucial swing states like Florida, Ohio and Colorado, and both camps are now trying to prove their bona fides with that population. When added to recent data that shows an increase in Hispanic voters in key states, the Obama campaign sees an opening to paint Mr. Romney as out of touch among both women and Hispanics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as the Romney campaign is concerned, officials say that efforts to paint their candidate as an extremist will not fly. ''They are grasping at straws,'' said Andrea Saul, Mr. Romney's spokeswoman. ''The Obama campaign first said President Obama was going to run on his record and the election would be a referendum on his handling of the economy. When it was clear that wouldn't work, his team said they were going to adopt a 'Kill Mitt' strategy. Then came the plan to run against President Bush again, and then, against Congress. Next they tried to claim Governor Romney had no core.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Saul said that while ''each new day brings a different made-up attack from the Obama campaign, what doesn't change is the fact that President Obama has failed and so is going to try to tear down Mitt Romney instead of talking about his record.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, voters should ready themselves for reminders from the Obama campaign that Mr. Romney proposed eliminating Title X, the only federal program devoted to family planning, that he suggested letting the foreclosure process ''run its course and hit the bottom,'' and that he staked out a position on immigration that was to the right of Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich. The campaign will make certain it is well known that Mr. Romney just agreed to be the commencement speaker at the conservative Liberty University; in fact, within minutes of Chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr.'s announcement on Thursday, Democratic operatives were e-mailing the news around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mitt Romney has spent the last two years taking the most extreme positions of his party, whether it's on economic policy or social policy,'' said Stephanie Cutter, the deputy campaign manager of Mr. Obama's re-election team. ''He can try to flip-flop to the center, but who is going to believe him?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, said in a telephone interview, ''Whether it's tax policy, whether it's his approach to abortion, gay rights, immigration, he's the most conservative nominee that they've had going back to Goldwater.'' He added that ''one of the key issues in the campaign is to make sure people know that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about David Axelrod's Twitter feed, which has, nonstop for the past few months, seemed fixated on a depiction of Mr. Romney as the ultimate feather in the wind? (''Yesterday, Mitt predicted victory. Today, he says 3d would be fine. He can't even stick to the same position on THAT!'' Mr. Axelrod, an Obama adviser, said on Twitter on the morning of the Iowa caucuses in January.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama strategists insist they're not flip-flopping on the flip-flopper label, which they believe can serve them well at any given moment. But there appears to be a clear realization that for general election purposes, they may do better with an emphasis on Mr. Romney's conservative stances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason goes back to the very thing that has, all along, made Mr. Romney the candidate whom the Obama campaign has always viewed as the most formidable out of the Republican herd. Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, the architect of a health care plan which is remarkably similar to Mr. Obama's signature domestic policy item, is still viewed among many independents as something of a moderate, and as such, he is more dangerous to Mr. Obama in a general election than the rest of the Republican field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That viewpoint made Mr. Romney vulnerable during the Republican primaries and at least partly explains his fierce embrace of conservation positions to offset Republican doubts. But it may make him tougher to beat in November. Mr. Romney himself seemed to acknowledge his need to move to the center during his overheard remarks on Sunday, when he told supporters that ''we have to get Hispanic voters to vote for our party,'' and warned that big Latino support for Mr. Obama ''spells doom for us.'' While he did not explicitly endorse a Republican proposal to chart a path to legality for the offspring of illegal residents, he didn't dismiss the idea either.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just more than six months to go before the November elections, two distinct strategies have emerged among political interest groups: an air war on the right and a ground game on the left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cadre of super PACs and nonprofit groups backing Republicans plans to spend more than $450 million to oppose President Obama and other Democrats, relying almost exclusively on waves of radio and television ads that will wash over battleground states in coming months. The onslaught has begun as Republican groups strive to damage Obama's standing ahead of the parties' national conventions this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal groups, by contrast, are focused more heavily on grass-roots organizing, led by labor unions that hope to spend more than $400 million to rally their members and nonunionized voters against likely GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The differing strategies mean that voters, particularly in swing states, probably will be inundated with television advertisements attacking Obama well beyond whatever the Romney campaign airs. At the same time, many voters also will encounter swarms of canvassers handing out fliers and knocking on doors in support of Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each side is banking on the idea that its approach will help shift the balance in what is shaping up to be a close-fought campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The efforts underscore the prominent role that interest groups will play in the 2012 elections, when their spending could exceed $1 billion. For Democrats, unions are particularly crucial because liberal super PACs and nonprofit organizations have fallen far short of their conservative counterparts in fundraising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spending by interest groups comes on top of ambitious goals set by the Obama and Romney campaigns, each of which has suggested to donors that it could meet or exceed Obama's record-setting haul of $745 million in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groups on both sides also are taking full advantage of court rulings that have loosened limits on election activities. Well-funded conservative groups are attracting $10 million checks from wealthy financiers and corporations that are no longer restricted in their political giving.           Labor organizations, meanwhile, have been able to cast away regulations that made it harder for them to fish for votes among nonunion households.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contrast already is becoming clear in swing states such as Ohio, where the conservative group Crossroads GPS is blitzing the airwaves this month with TV ads attacking Obama's energy policies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor-backed groups in the state, in the meantime, are focused on canvassing drives to register voters, support Democrats and push for the defeat of a proposed anti-union state ballot initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we're doing is much more grass-roots than what the other side is doing,&quot; said Michael Gillis, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO of Ohio, which has about 600,000 members. &quot;We have Ohio working people talking to Ohio working people about the issues. It's a sharp contrast with the air war that the other side wages with their rhetoric and outside money financing the whole thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the major conservative groups believe grass-roots organizing is best left to Romney and the Republican National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of us don't think it's efficient for outside groups to do ground-game activities,&quot; said one super PAC official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. &quot;The campaign finance laws are set up to allow the parties to do that, and we believe they do it quite well. Our added value will be on the airwaves.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor organizations have long been shackled by limits on their political activity that required them to confine much of their canvassing and get-out-the-vote effort to union members, whose numbers have been steadily dwindling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, unions have concluded they can ignore such restrictions under the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in                 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">             , which freed corporations and unions to spend unlimited funds on elections.          The ruling paved the way for the super PACs that have had enormous success, particularly among conservatives, in raising money from wealthy donors with no restrictions.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But labor lawyers say the decision also means that unions can use their treasury funds to encourage nonunion members to vote for specific candidates, a tactic that was barred under previous laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's always been the bread and butter of labor that we had our ground game, but this really expands the possibilities,&quot; said Eddie Vale, spokesman for Workers' Voice, a super PAC formed by the AFL-CIO that plans to focus on grass-roots organizing.  Democrats are relying on such efforts to help counter the high-dollar fundraising of conservative groups. Three of the leading organizations backing Romney and other Republicans - American Crossroads, Restore Our Future and the American Action Network - plan to spend well over $300 million between now and November. Tens of millions more will be spent by Republican-leaning interest groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Jonathan Collegio, a spokesman for the American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS groups, said independent conservative groups are &quot;a counterbalance to the long-term influence that labor unions have had on the political process for decades. . . . What's going on on the right is clearly balanced out by the labor unions.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The environmental lobby is also a major player on the left. The League of Conservation Voters, for example, is planning a mix of grass-roots organizing and media buys, including a pro-Obama&nbsp;ad campaign to be launched next week.Union leaders are coy about their specific plans but say they hope to match the estimated $450 million spent by unions and their political action committees in 2008. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest spender, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, says it expects to surpass the $93 million it spent four years ago on federal, state and local elections. Another major player, the National Education Association, a teachers union, also hopes to beat its 2008 total of $50 million, officials said.&quot;There are so many different ways to go at voters, but at some point what's really going to matter is who's in your network, who's in your community, and who do you trust?&quot; said Carrie Pugh, campaign manager for the 3.2 million-member NEA. &quot;We are banking on our members.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's always been the bread and butter of labor that we had our ground game, but this really expands the possibilities,&quot; said Eddie Vale, spokesman for Workers' Voice, a super PAC formed by the AFL-CIO that plans to focus on grass-roots organizing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats are relying on such efforts to help counter the high-dollar fundraising of conservative groups. Three of the leading organizations backing Romney and other Republicans - American Crossroads, Restore Our Future and the American Action Network - plan to spend well over $300 million between now and November. Tens of millions more will be spent by Republican-leaning interest groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Collegio, a spokesman for the American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS groups, said independent conservative groups are &quot;a counterbalance to the long-term influence that labor unions have had on the political process for decades. . . . What's going on on the right is clearly balanced out by the labor unions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The environmental lobby is also a major player on the left. The League of Conservation Voters, for example, is planning a mix of grass-roots organizing and media buys, including a pro-Obama&nbsp;ad campaign to be launched next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union leaders are coy about their specific plans but say they hope to match the estimated $450 million spent by unions and their political action committees in 2008. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest spender, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, says it expects to surpass the $93 million it spent four years ago on federal, state and local elections. Another major player, the National Education Association, a teachers union, also hopes to beat its 2008 total of $50 million, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are so many different ways to go at voters, but at some point what's really going to matter is who's in your network, who's in your community, and who do you trust?&quot; said Carrie Pugh, campaign manager for the 3.2 million-member NEA. &quot;We are banking on our members.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A look at some of the new staff members Mitt Romney is bringing to his campaign to prepare for a general election contest against President Obama.&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOSTON - Mitt Romney has been busy dashing across the country. He is honing his message, raising money and, of course, bringing on new staff members to prepare for a general election contest against President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is preliminary glimpse of what Team Romney: The General looks like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austin Barbour, 36, who joined the Romney campaign in a volunteer capacity early on as a national finance chairman and also helped on the political side, is moving to Boston to come on board full-time as a deputy to Stuart Stevens, a senior strategist. Mr. Barbour, the nephew of former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, was also the Romney campaign's point person during the Mississippi primary, in which Mr. Romney finished third behind Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, Mr. Barbour epitomizes the ideal Romney hire, as the campaign struggles to bring on new people to meet the growing demand of a general election campaign while still maintaining its disciplined and insular culture. He is trusted to stay on message, and many in the campaign have worked with him previously. He and Mr. Stevens have deep ties dating back to their native Mississippi; in 1982, when Mr. Barbour was still a boy, Mr. Stevens ran the Senate race for his uncle, Haley Barbour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech writing operation, up until this point largely a joint effort between Mr. Romney himself and Mr. Stevens, will also get a face-lift, with Lindsay Hayes becoming the director of speech writing. Ms. Hayes worked on the McCain-Palin speech writing team in 2008, and was the senior writer for the Republican National Convention that year. She is currently finishing a Ph.D. in Communication (Rhetoric and Political Culture) at the University of Maryland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Ferguson, who had already relocated to Boston and was helping out on the ad side, will now officially join the creative team. Mr. Ferguson, the former president and chief creative officer of Y&amp;R (formerly Young &amp; Rubicam), previously worked with Mr. Stevens on President George W. Bush's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The communications team is beefing up, as well. Richard Grenell, who served for eight years as the communications director for the United States at the United Nations, is coming on board as the national security and foreign policy spokesman, and Sarah Pompei, who most recently served as the communications director for House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy will join the campaign as its deputy communications director for regional press. Mr. Grenell previously worked for President George H. W. Bush's re-election campaign, as well as for Arizona Senator John McCain's 2000 bid. Ms. Pompei previously worked as press secretary for Meg Whitman's gubernatorial campaign, as well as on Mr. Romney's 2008 presidential bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kristy Campbell, who serves as the national communications director of the American Conservative Union, the country's oldest and largest grass-roots conservative organization, will join the campaign as its deputy communications director for media affairs. She was previously press secretary to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich Beeson, the campaign's political director, currently has one deputy, Todd Cranney, but will be adding two more: Jason McBride, who led Mr. Romney's successful New Hampshire effort, and Dan Centinello, who worked on Mr. Romney's 2008 bid, as well as Missouri Senator Roy Blunt's 2010 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, of course, some existing roles will be rejiggered. Sarah Nelson, Lamar Echols and Danny O'Driscoll will become regional political directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Wong, an attorney and Iraq Rule of Law adviser at the State Department, will coordinate the foreign and national security policy for the campaign, while Oren Cass, a Bain &amp; Company consultant who worked in Mr. Romney's 2008 policy shop, will coordinate the domestic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An earlier version of this post misstated the position of Jim Ferguson, a member of Mitt Romney's creative team, at Y&amp;R. He is the company's former president and chief creative officer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mitt Romney has plenty of time to catch up, but right now, his campaign's apparatus lags far behind President Obama's in key states. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having essentially secured the Republican nomination, Mitt Romney now faces a general election to-do list. He must try to repair his favorability ratings among independent voters, which were eroded by a bruising primary campaign. He must try to close a gender gap that shows women supporting President Obama by a wide margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But more fundamentally, Mr. Romney must begin the nuts-and-bolts work of setting up a general-election campaign. In crucial battleground states, the Romney camp must hire staff and open field offices, woo volunteers and knock on doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, the Obama campaign has been laying the groundwork for the general election for some time. Although Mr. Romney has the time and resources to catch up, the president has already plowed millions of dollars into the beginnings of a ground game that stretches from battleground Ohio to long-shot Arizona to safely-Republican Wyoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Below is a chart of the Obama campaign's field offices and paid staff in 12 states that are likely to prove decisive in November. The figures - for a variety of technical reasons - should be viewed as a rough approximation of the breadth of the Obama campaign's operation. For instance, the number of field offices in each state comes from the Obama campaign's Web site, www.barackobama.com. But it is not clear how active each office is, and in a couple cases the number of offices reported by the Obama campaign differs from the number reported in news accounts, although by just a few offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caveats aside, Mr. Obama has a substantial head start in organizing a general election get-out-the-vote operation, particularly in the number of field offices he has established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extent to which Mr. Romney can match the Obama campaign's footprint in swing states may prove critical in deciding the election. A campaign's ground game is hardly the sole determinant in an election, but it can be decisive in a close contest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Mr. Obama built a sprawling get-out-the-vote operation. The Obama campaign established more than 700 field offices, concentrated in swing states. Senator John McCain's campaign had fewer than 400. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Field offices serve as a base for the most effective get-out-the-vote tactics, like door-to-door canvassing. In fact, in 2008, the Obama campaign's wide web of field offices, and the advantages those offices gave Mr. Obama over Mr. McCain, helped flip three states to Democratic from Republican, according to a study by Seth E. Masket, an assistant professor with the Department of Political Science at the University of Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has at least two paid staffers in all 12 battleground states (the paid staff and salary figures are based on the recipient's state of residency in the F.E.C. filings. The figures do not include volunteers and are updated through the most recent F.E.C. filing, Feb. 29).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, Mr. Obama has spent $13.4 million on direct salary payments. About 59 percent of that was for workers based in Illinois, where the president's re-election team is headquartered. The Romney campaign, which is based in Boston, has spent $4.1 million in salaries for campaign workers in Massachusetts (although, for both campaigns, salaried employees can travel to other states). Mr. Romney also spent about $813,000 for temporary workers in primary states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, the president's campaign has spent more on staff salaries outside of Illinois than the Romney campaign has spent on salaries over all, including Massachusetts workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney is not starting entirely from scratch. The infrastructure the campaign set up for primaries, in states like Florida and Ohio, was mostly - though not completely - temporary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nine of the swing states listed above held primaries during the competitive phase of the Republican primary, and the Romney campaign should be able to build off its efforts in those states. &quot;We're working now to expand on the strong foundation that we laid during the primary process,&quot; Ryan Williams, a spokesman for Mr. Romney said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney has many months to build that operation. In addition, once he is he official nominee, Mr. Romney will inherit the infrastructure being built by the Republican National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A national campaign's localized outreach - field offices, staff and volunteers - helps a candidate contact voters in a more personal manner. Potential voters have been shown to be more receptive when contacted by someone in their community rather than by a television commercial or automated phone call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, about a fourth of all voters were contacted in some way by the Obama campaign. Mr. McCain's campaign contacted 18 percent of general-election voters. A FiveThirtyEight study from just after the 2008 election found that &quot;each marginal 10-point advantage in contact rate translated into a marginal 3-point gain in the popular vote in that state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Mr. Obama did not exactly need those few percentage points. But by many early measures, the 2012 election between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney is shaping up as a much closer race than the 2008 contest, and a couple percentage points won by the hard work of local get-out-the-vote operations could make the difference. Mr. Obama has an early, but by no means insurmountable, lead in building such an apparatus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the attributes I most envy in a public man (or woman) is the ability to lie. If that ability is coupled with no sense of humor, you have the sort of man who can be a successful football coach, a CEO or, when you come right down to it, a presidential candidate. Such a man is Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time and time again, Romney has been called a liar during this campaign. (The various fact-checking organizations have had to work overtime on him alone.) A significant moment, sure to surface in the general election campaign, came during a debate held in New Hampshire in January. David Gregory, the host of &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; turned to Newt Gingrich and said, &quot;You have agreed with the characterization that Governor Romney is a liar. Look at him now. Do you stand by that claim?&quot;          Gingrich did not flinch. &quot;Sure, governor,&quot; he started off, and then accused Romney of running ads that were not true and, moreover, pretending he knew nothing about them. &quot;It is your millionaire friends giving to the PAC. And you know some of the ads aren't true. Just say that straightforward.&quot;           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Me, I would have confessed and begged for forgiveness. Not Romney, though - and herein is the reason he will be such a formidable general-election candidate. He concedes nothing. He had seen none of the ads, he said. They were done by others, he added. Of course, they are his supporters, but he had no control over them. All this time he was saying this rubbish, he seemed calm, sincere - matter of  fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then he brought up an ad he said he did see. It was about Gingrich's heretical support for a climate-change bill. He dropped the name of the extremely evil Nancy Pelosi. He accused Gingrich of criticizing Paul Ryan's first budget plan, an Ayn Randish document whose great virtue is a terrible honesty. (We are indeed going broke.) He added that Gingrich had been in ethics trouble in the House and ended with a promise to make sure his ads were as truthful as could be. Pow! Pow! Pow! Gingrich was on the canvas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I watched, impressed. I admire a smooth liar, and Romney is among the best. His technique is to explain - that bit about not knowing what was in the ads - and then counterattack. He maintains the bulletproof demeanor of a man who is barely suffering fools, in this case Gingrich. His message is not so much what he says, but what he is: You cannot touch me. I have the organization and the money. Especially the money. (Even the hair.) You're a loser. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are those who maintain that President Obama, too, is a liar. The president's recent attack on Ryan's new budget proposal sent countless critics scurrying to their thesauruses for ways to say lie - &quot;comprehensively misrepresenting&quot; is the way George F. Will put it. (He also said Obama &quot;is not nearly as well educated as many thought.&quot;) Obama does indeed sometimes play politics with the truth, as when he declared that a Supreme Court reversal of his health care law would be unprecedented. He then backed down. Not what he meant, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But where Romney is different is that he is not honest about himself. He could, as he did just recently, stand before the National Rifle Association as if he were, in spirit as well as membership, one of them. In body language, in the blinking of the eyes, in the nonexistent pounding pulse, there was not the tiniest suggestion that here was a man who just as confidently once embodied the anti-gun ethic of Massachusetts, the distant land he once governed. Instead, he tore into Obama for the (nonexistent) threat the president posed to Second Amendment rights - a false accusation from a false champion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A marathon of debates and an eon of campaigning have toughened and honed Romney. He commands the heights of great assurance, and he knows, as some of us learn too late in life, that the truth is not always a moral obligation but sometimes merely what works. He often cites his business background as commending him for the presidency. That's his forgivable absurdity. Instead, what his career has given him is the businessman's concept of self - that what he does is not who he is. This is what enables the slumlord to be a charitable man. This is what enables the corporate raider to endow his university. Business is business. It's what you do. It is not who you are. Lying isn't a sin. It's a business plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The figure is part of what the Romney campaign estimates will be a total of $1 billion spent in an effort to defeat President Obama.&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new joint fund-raising initiative between Mitt Romney and the Republican National Committee will aim to raise $800 million by November, part of what Mr. Romney's campaign estimates will be a total of $1 billion spent in an effort to defeat President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goals were laid out in a memo circulated by Mr. Romney's top fund-raisers in recent days and on a conference call with donors late last week. The memo indicates that Mr. Romney's top aides are aiming to collect roughly $500 million combined for the campaign and for the joint fund, known as Romney Victory, through a program for high-dollar donations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also hoping to bring in $300 million in low-dollar donations, an area in which Mr. Romney has lagged well behind other Republican candidates and Mr. Obama but in which the R.N.C. has performed relatively well. The campaign also estimates that &quot;super PACs&quot; and other outside groups will spend an additional $200 million in the race, according to the memo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People closely involved in Mr. Romney's fund-raising efforts said last week that they expected the campaign's share to total about $600 million. Much depends on Mr. Romney's ability to win the allegiance of hundreds of top Republican &quot;bundlers&quot; - those who raise money on behalf of a campaign - who did not commit to a candidate during the nominating contests. And it is common for campaigns to understate the fund-raising targets they circulate among top fund-raisers, to beat expectations down the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have suggested that Mr. Obama, who raised about $750 million during his first run for president, will ultimately raise $1 billion for his re-election effort, a figure that the president's campaign has vigorously disputed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $800 million total includes about $86 million that the memo says Mr. Romney has raised during the Republican primary. Mr. Romney reported raising $75.6 million through the end of February, suggesting that his campaign has taken in roughly $10 million since the beginning of March. The R.N.C. raised $13.7 million in March, the committee's best month of the cycle so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee raised $53 million during the same month, part of a well-oiled joint fund-raising operation that started up last spring and has staged more than 100 major fund-raisers. That figure, which includes money the D.N.C. raises on its own, was announced by Mr. Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, in a video posted on the campaign's Web site early Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Messina said in the video that 567,000 people donated to the campaign in March, and that the average contribution was $50.78.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This really is how this works,&quot; Mr. Messina says in the video. &quot;People building this organization 5 or 10 bucks at a time to take on Mitt Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not disclose how much money the campaign gathered in small checks versus large ones, or give a breakdown of the $53 million describing how much went into the campaign, which can take a maximum of $5,000 from each donor, and the Democratic committee, which can raise $30,800 from each donor each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More complete figures - along with detailed records of how much the campaigns and the parties spent in March - are due to be filed with the Federal Election Commission by April 20.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In a conference call Monday night with supporters and members of the news media, Rick Santorum said he would be &quot;active&quot; in the presidential campaign, but did not endorse Mitt Romney.&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Santorum said Monday night that he would be &quot;active&quot; in the presidential campaign, but he did not endorse Mitt Romney or encourage voters in states like Pennsylvania to vote for Mr. Romney in their coming primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a half-hour conference call with more than 4,000 supporters and members of the news media, Mr. Santorum said he had not talked with Mr. Romney, who became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee when Mr. Santorum suspended his campaign last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A news release alerting the news media to the call said that Mr. Santorum would be sharing his thoughts &quot;on the campaign&quot; and his future, and that he would answer some questions submitted in advance. The call was also an attempt to raise money for his campaign, which remains in debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what his role would be in the fall campaign, Mr. Santorum said he would be &quot;all in&quot; and do everything he could to be helpful in the presidential race and in the Senate races. &quot;You will see me active and engaged,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said several times that he wanted to ensure his views were reflected in the presidential campaign and said that he would &quot;make sure we have a conservative platform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum suggested on the call that he was putting together some sort of organization to keep alive the conservative ideas and values that he put forth during the campaign, but he was vague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the chance to encourage voters to support Mr. Romney and start uniting behind him to defeat President Obama in the fall, Mr. Santorum did not take it. When he was asked, for example, how his supporters in Pennsylvania, which holds its primary April 24, should vote, now that he has dropped out, he said: &quot;The best thing they can do is stay tuned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will have a place for people to organize and to rally to make a difference,&quot; he said, but he gave no hint whether this effort would be in the service of the Romney campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're working on something now, so stay tuned,&quot; he said. &quot;As far as who you vote for, that's up to you. I haven't supported any candidate at this point, so that's really up to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor did he say he would free his delegates to support Mr. Romney at the party's national convention in Tampa, Fla., in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want our delegates to go to the convention and have a say and make sure they have an impact,&quot; he said. He said he hoped the Republican National Committee and the states in which he won delegates would respect his wishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to work with the states to make sure our delegates are seated&quot; and can press for conservative ideas, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he was an active candidate, he had strongly criticized Mr. Romney for not being conservative enough and for not being able to draw a sharp enough contrast with Mr. Obama on various issues, including health care. The call at times sounded like a long-distance attempt to warn Mr. Romney not to tack to the political center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum said he would make additional announcements &quot;in the next week or two&quot; about how he would be moving forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife, Karen, was on another line with their daughter Bella, who had been hospitalized over the Easter weekend. Bella cooed into the phone a couple of times, and Mrs. Santorum assured listeners that she was doing well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Who knew Scotch was a centrist's drink? The fusion of political campaign targeting and consumer marketing goes deeper and gets weirder. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past decade, political campaigns, interest groups and a network of private companies have developed sophisticated tools to target tinier and tinier fractions of the electorate. Campaigns now have access to the voting histories, housing values, recreational preferences, automobile ownership and television and Internet viewing habits of individuals. The explosion of consumer data derived primarily from credit card usage and Nielsen ratings has become a powerful weapon in the hands of politicos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Especially at the presidential level, but also in Senate and House contests, microtechnology - the term of art for the acquisition of this kind of detailed information about specific individuals, including not only your political preferences and your likelihood of voting, but also other seemingly less political facts, like the clothes you buy, the movies you go to, the brands you prefer and the number of bedrooms in your home -&nbsp;has come into its own. Compiling this information has given added firepower to almost every aspect of campaigns, from decisions about which television show to run ads on, to the content of targeted emails, to the selection of which houses volunteers should visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advances in the speed of computers and constantly improved software have created, in just over a decade, the development of a new political industry, nanotargeting - microtargeting to the nth degree. There has been excellent reporting on the innovative work of this industry, along with debunking of excessive claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parsing data gives politicians and their campaigns ways to identify and communicate with segments of the electorate that would have been out of reach not long ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2004 Bush campaign, a pioneer in the use of microtechnology, targeted anti-gay marriage messages to socially conservative Democratic black voters in the belief that they could be pressured either to cast ballots for Bush or to sit out the election. Republican strategists claim that these tactics can be credited with improving Bush's margins among black voters in the key battleground state of Ohio from a dismal 9 percent in 2000 (compared to 89 percent for Gore) to a modestly better 16 percent for Bush in 2004 (compared to 84 percent for Kerry).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African-Americans cast 10 percent of the Ohio vote in 2004 so a 5 percentage point shift amounted to just 0.5 percent of the entire Ohio electorate, a relatively slight 28,139 votes out of 5,627,908 cast. Bush, however, won Ohio by only 118,601 votes. If Kerry had maintained Gore's advantage among blacks, Bush's margin of victory would have shrunk to a dangerously low 62,323 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a close contest, incremental shifts like these among key constituencies - Hispanics, single white working class women and private sector unionized employees - can be decisive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a broader scale, the emergence of nanotargeting represents the addition of one more factor in modern political life that intensifies polarization. The industry capitalizes on (and profits from) identifying how partisans on the left and right differ. Campaigns then use this information to target explicitly polarizing messages that are designed to expand or suppress turnout among a specific subgroup of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men and women who earn a living by selling microtechnology to campaigns benefit from this intensifying polarization, which drives greater segmentation of the electorate, which in turn becomes ever more receptive to ideologically extreme communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, microtechnology, as the charts below illustrate, provides data-driven insight into the complex internal mechanics of campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps most interesting, the findings emerging out of advances in microtechnology are a window into the striking differences in the tastes and interests of liberal and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans. Among other things, Democrats and Republicans differ in the entertainment they prefer, the restaurants they go to, the drinks they chose and the Web sites they visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the findings confirm stereotypes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take this chart, one of a number provided by Will Feltus of National Media - a Republican firm specializing in media research, planning and placement - that describes the Democratic and Republican leanings of consumers. For conservatives, the findings buttress the claim that readers of The Times and The Washington Post - as well viewers of Comedy Central - tilt to the left.&nbsp; For liberals, here is concrete evidence demonstrating the depth of the appeal of Fox News to the right, as well as The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feltus, a specialist in political media research and lead author of &quot;Campaign Manager,&quot; which will be published later this year, is a fount of information on the subject of data mining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take cable-television viewing. On the chart below, the horizontal axis runs from very Democratic viewers on the left to very Republican on the right. The vertical axis measures the level of turnout among viewers, with low voter participation at the bottom and high participation at the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the chart above shows, viewers of soap operas and VH1 skew strongly Democratic, but they turn out to vote at low rates. Viewers of MSNBC and CNN also skew Democratic, but they turn out to vote at far higher rates. On the other side of the aisle, Country Music Television attracts a strongly Republican audience, but its viewers are not regular voters; viewers of the Golf Channel and Fox News, on the other hand, are reliably Republican and also turn out in large numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television is inherently problematic for Republicans. &quot;The average TV show will deliver 15-25% more Democrats compared to Republicans,&quot; according to Feltus. Republican spending on positive commercials wastes money because, on average, many more Democrats will be watching. There are, however, specific shows that are more Republican than Democratic in their viewership - which is one of the reasons that detailed data on the partisanship of people who watch individual shows is particularly valuable to Republicans seeking to spend money wisely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top-ten Republican-tilted shows are &quot;The Office,&quot; &quot;Rules of Engagement,&quot; &quot;The Mentalist,&quot; &quot;New Yankee Workshop,&quot; &quot;The Big Bang Theory,&quot; &quot;Castle,&quot; &quot;Desperate Housewives,&quot; &quot;Dancing With The Stars,&quot; &quot;The Biggest Loser,&quot; and &quot;Grey's Anatomy.&quot; The top ten most Democratic-leaning shows are &quot;Washington Week,&quot; &quot;Tavis Smiley,&quot; &quot;Late Show with David Letterman,&quot; &quot;The View,&quot; &quot;PBS NewsHour,&quot; &quot;NOW&quot; on PBS, &quot;House of Payne,&quot; &quot;ABC World News Now,&quot; &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;Insider Weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consistent finding in studies of consumer behavior is that the more Republican the skew, the higher the turnout - as the chart below demonstrates. This works to the advantage of both parties, depending on what the goal of the campaign is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the purpose of advertising is to reinforce commitments among voters likely to turn out - a strategy behind much last-minute media spending - Republicans have the edge. If, conversely, the goal is to mobilize sympathetic but not well-motivated constituencies - often the strategy behind early and mid-election spending - Democrats have the advantage because the data from nanotargeting provides a means to activate low-turnout pro-Democratic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of restaurants, some chains are well to the right or left, but most, including the largest ones like McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's, are at the political center. Those chains with high-turnout clientele are overwhelmingly Republican-leaning, including Cracker Barrel, Macaroni Grill, Outback Steakhouse, Arby's and Chick-fil-A, while Church's Chicken and Chuck E. Cheese's are low-turnout Democratic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same patterns emerge in the analysis of internet users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These charts only touch on the surface of the useful commercial information available to campaigns. Sometimes the information reaffirms stereotypes, but at other times, it defies them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats, for example, are far more likely to be behind the wheel of a hybrid, a Subaru, a Honda or a VW - but Audis and Mercedes? Some automobiles that have traditionally been seen as the vehicles of choice for affluent Republican suburbanites - Lincolns, Buicks and Caddys - are now either Democratic-leaning or evenly split. Porches and Hummers are, as one would expect, Republican, but the Land Rover is nearly off the charts as the most Republican of all vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, there are intriguing partisan patterns in the consumption of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who would have guessed that the most Democratic drink by a long shot is Cognac, or that such lite beers as Amstel Lite, Michelob Ultra, Miller Lite and Sam Adams Light tilt so far to the political right, while Bud, Miller High Life, and Natural Lite are Democratic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groups like No Labels that seek to revive bipartisanship on Capitol Hill would be well advised to serve Bud Light, Guinness, Scotch, Michelob Lite and Coors Original at their fundraisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one key respect - the placement of television ads - the 2008 Obama campaign stands in contrast to the other presidential bids of the last decade, including those of George W. Bush, John McCain, Al Gore and John Kerry. These candidates appealed most strongly on television to their own partisan bases. McCain and Bush spent much more heavily advertising on shows with Republican-leaning audiences, and Gore and Kerry did just the opposite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These patterns are demonstrated in a fascinating paper, &quot;Separation by Television Program: Understanding the Targeting of Political Advertising in Presidential Elections,&quot; by Travis N. Ridout, Michael Franz, Kenneth M. Goldstein and Feltus, which was published earlier this year in the journal Political Communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Obama put more of his money on advertising aimed at Republican-leaning audiences. This reflected the political reality that he had far more cash than McCain and could afford to go after independent and moderate Republican voters aggressively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2010 mid-term elections, the authors of &quot;Separation by Television Program&quot; found, senatorial and gubernatorial spending was tilted toward base supporters. Republicans were more likely to buy time on college and professional football shows, while Democrats bought ads on sitcoms like &quot;30 Rock&quot; and &quot;Two and a Half Men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The television spending strategies of Obama and Mitt Romney will emerge as the campaign progresses. Given the highly polarized character of the electorate this year, both sides are likely to spend most heavily on their own base voters, seeking to get them to the polls, so that a viewer of &quot;30 Rock,&quot; for example, is unlikely to see any Republican ads, while a professional football enthusiast won't see many Democratic ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In effect, both sides will lay out megabucks preaching to the choir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The less predictable strategic decisions involve what the campaigns will be willing to spend to win over the relatively small numbers of undecided voters, many of them uninterested in politics and unlikely to vote in high percentages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closeness of the contest will in all likelihood determine how much money will be spent on these voters: the smaller the margin between Obama and Romney, the more cash will go into the high cost of persuading reluctant participants and in motivating them to go to the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, however, a wildcard. Money in 2012 will be plentiful. Both Romney and Obama are not accepting public money and will be free to spend as much as they can raise. On that front, they are both expected to be very successful. The emergence of super PACs accepting unlimited donations from individuals and corporations, together with what the candidates themselves will raise, makes it virtually certain that this campaign will produce record-setting levels of spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loosening of fiscal constraints may have unanticipated consequences. Broadening the scope of campaign appeals well beyond core partisan voters is likely to produce a less polarized and more bipartisan television spending pattern &nbsp;- a pattern that could surprise us all by contributing to a slow depolarization of American politics.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 18</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">474 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican politicians gathering at the National Rifle Association convention in St. Louis are eagerly pandering to a powerful political lobby that is intent on making the nation's gun laws weaker and more riddled with more dangerous loopholes. Rather than tackling public safety risks like the Stand Your Ground law implicated in the killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida, Mitt Romney and others offered nothing but exhortations to defend the Second Amendment's right to bear arms at all costs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has regrettably been avoiding the gun control issue. Still, Mr. Romney attacked him at the convention on Friday, promising to stand with the N.R.A. ''for the rights of hunters and sportsmen and those seeking to protect their homes and their families.'' This was a far cry from Mr. Romney's 1994 campaign for the United States Senate when he assured centrist Massachusetts voters: ''I don't line up with the N.R.A.'' Yet there he was in St. Louis, lining up. Newt Gingrich, in his over-the-top manner, urged a United Nations campaign to proclaim the Second Amendment ''a human right for every person on the planet.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The convention, in its ''celebration of American values,'' has drawn tens of thousands of members to see genuflecting Republicans and to browse a seven-acre commercial mart of guns and shooting paraphernalia, much of it designed for the battlefields of war, not the home front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notably absent are top Democratic politicians, who seem to have concluded that, despite thousands of constituents shot or killed each year, it is best to go silent about gun control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show Republicans enjoy heavy support and donations from gun owners. In return, the gun lobby has had steady success in weakening gun laws -- especially in the two dozen statehouses that followed Florida in enacting new self-defense laws to allow the instant use of deadly force in a confrontation rather than retreat from danger. These laws are fostered by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, with heavyweight business supporters like Walmart, a major gun retailer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The families of the victims killed and wounded in the Virginia Tech massacre do not come close to having such clout. For the tragedy's fifth anniversary next week, they are having a hard time securing meetings with Washington politicians to fix the law that promised a more complete and up-to-date federal list of the mentally ill, who should be barred from buying guns. But two dozen states have submitted fewer than 100 mental health records each when tens of thousands should be entered, according to Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a national gun reform group. Financing to help state reporting efforts was supposed to be $1.1 billion over the last four years, yet Congress appropriated only $51 million. So goes the nation's utter failure to deal with the gun menace.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big money in presidential politics is about to get a whole lot bigger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides and leading donors to Mitt Romney are preparing a major expansion of the campaign's fund-raising efforts to prepare for a general election contest against President Obama, with the goal of raising up to $600 million, according to several people involved in the discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican-leaning outside groups and Democratic-leaning unions are planning to spend hundreds of millions more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. Obama, who raised $750 million in 2008, is likely to meet or exceed that this year, according to people involved in his fund-raising operation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those goals make it virtually certain that neither party's nominee will accept public funds for the general election or the spending limits that come with them -- the likely death knell for a cornerstone of the post-Watergate campaign finance reforms intended to limit the influence of money in federal elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama opted out of the public financing program in 2008, breaking a campaign pledge, and went on to outspend the Republican nominee, John McCain, by four to one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is going to be the most moneyed election in the history of the United States,'' said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause, a group that favors greater restrictions on campaign spending. Mr. Edgar, a former congressman who was among the Democratic ''Watergate babies'' elected in the wake of the scandal, added, ''There is a sense of coming full circle, of forgetting our history -- the reason we installed a system for financing campaigns that didn't rely on corporate or wealthy money.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has already held over a hundred major fund-raisers for his campaign, jointly raising large amounts with the Democratic National Committee, and Mr. Romney is moving quickly to catch up. His campaign is planning dozens of fund-raisers through the end of June, high-dollar events that will feature Mr. Romney as well as the campaign's top allies and other elected officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign is setting a goal of raising at least $1 million for most events featuring Mr. Romney personally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those efforts will be aided by a new joint fund-raising agreement with the Republican National Committee that allows Mr. Romney to command far larger checks than he has during the primaries, when his campaign was limited to increments of $2,500 or less. Under the agreement, guests at major Romney events will be able to write checks as large as $75,000 to a ''Romney Victory'' committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About half of that sum would go Mr. Romney's campaign or the Republican committee, mimicking the arrangement under which Mr. Obama, as an incumbent, has been raising money since last spring for his campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The remainder will be split among Republican state parties in Massachusetts, Idaho, Oklahoma and Vermont -- where party leaders are deemed loyal to Mr. Romney -- and later re-allocated to the most critical battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's going to ramp up dramatically,'' said Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets and one of Mr. Romney's national finance co-chairmen. ''The response I've been getting, of people willing to max out on the victory side, has been very very good, very enthusiastic.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restore Our Future, the ''super PAC'' whose millions of dollars in negative advertising helped bury Mr. Romney's Republican rivals, will also shift its focus to the general election, officials familiar with its plans said. The group, which raised more than $43 million through the end of February, is hoping to reach the $100 million mark by the end of the cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The super PAC will also have help from Mr. Romney's allies and backers: Jim Talent, the former United States senator and a key surrogate for Mr. Romney during the primaries, appeared at a Restore Our Future briefing for donors in New York on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And people involved with the group's fund-raising have in recent days approached Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino owner whose family contributed over $16 million to a rival super PAC supporting Newt Gingrich, to consider contributing to Restore Our Future. They have also approached Charles and David Koch, the wealthy conservative businessmen who founded Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restore Our Future's political director, Carl Forti, is also an official with American Crossroads, a pro-Republican super PAC that is planning to raise as much as $300 million to spend on the 2012 elections. Federal rules permit the two super PACs to coordinate directly with each other on raising and spending money, and Mr. Romney's allies expect that Crossroads and other outside groups, like Americans for Prosperity, will spend up to $100 million against Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But people involved in the Romney fund-raising efforts emphasized that much about the plans remained fluid, as both the campaign and officials at outside groups who support Mr. Romney grapple with the new world of super PACs. The PACs are expected to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising this year and have tested programs more traditionally associated with campaigns, like voter identification and turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is so different,'' said one Romney adviser, who asked for anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. ''I think this is uncharted waters.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney advisers said the first wave of attack ads from Mr. Obama's campaign -- which sought to tie Mr. Romney to oil companies -- would soon be countered by commercials from Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also suggested that the combined fund-raising would make his campaign competitive with Mr. Obama and other pro-Democratic groups, chiefly unions, which are planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on federal, state and local elections this year. Mr. Obama's own supportive super PAC, Priorities USA Action, has had difficulty raising large contributions, though officials there hope they will increase significantly as the general election approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exactly how much Mr. Obama will raise this year is a matter of speculation and dispute. Mr. Romney's campaign and other Republicans have suggested that Mr. Obama -- the most successful presidential fund-raiser in history -- will bring in a billion dollars, a figure Mr. Obama's campaign has called little more than a myth intended to motivate conservative donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Mr. Romney's own donors believe that figure is more likely for Mr. Obama in combination with the Democratic National Committee and other outside groups, like Priorities USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In briefings with potential donors, officials at Priorities USA have estimated that Mr. Romney and the Republican National Committee would bring in a combined $750 million, while Restore Our Future would bring in $250 million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a strategy as old as American politics: You run toward the party base - on the left or right - in the primary and then move to the ideological middle once you become your party's standard-bearer. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing new there.

Finding quotes - or images - from candidates in obscure places or at anything other than sanctioned campaign events was virtually impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given those limitations, it was far easier for candidates to put their primary rhetoric behind them when they became the nominee.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that brave new world is a complication for Romney in the near term as he seeks to slough off some of the more conservative positions he embraced in the primaries, it's also a potential problem for Obama, who ran on &quot;hope&quot; and &quot;change&quot; in 2008 and, for many, has delivered less of both than they had hoped.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney moved Wednesday to confront one of his most vexing general election problems -- how to narrow the gender gap he faces against President Obama -- but his campaign immediately found itself squeezed between its intensifying efforts to appeal to women and its need to avoid alienating conservatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Female voters have emerged as one of Mr. Romney's largest vulnerabilities. A Washington Post/ABC News poll this week showed that women preferred Mr. Obama to Mr. Romney by 19 percentage points, and an earlier Gallup/USA Today poll of voters in 12 key swing states showed Mr. Obama leading over all, buoyed by independents and women -- two critical voting blocs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, in the face of mounting attacks from Democrats and the Obama campaign, Mr. Romney is taking steps to address that gender gap head on. In the past week, his campaign has devised a three-pronged strategy, which it finalized Tuesday night, advisers familiar with the internal discussions said. They will try to debunk the notion that Mr. Romney's policies have hurt women, turn the criticism back on Mr. Obama and outline how they believe women have suffered under his administration, and brand those issues in a memorable way. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the campaign stumbled Wednesday just as it was rolling out its new focus: top Romney policy aides, questioned on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act signed by Mr. Obama, which makes it easier for women to sue in equal pay cases, seemed uncertain of how to respond when a reporter asked about Mr. Romney's position on it during a campaign conference call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the campaign later released a statement saying Mr. Romney supports pay equity, the law is opposed by conservatives whom Mr. Romney is trying to rally for the general election. The Democrats, meanwhile, seized the opportunity to e-mail news releases citing Ms. Ledbetter's ''shocked and disappointed'' reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Romney campaign shifts to the general election, his aides will reintroduce him to voters, warming up his image by emphasizing his role as a devoted father and husband. Mr. Romney's wife, Ann, has already made several Web videos that feature her reminiscences, along with gauzy family photos; voters are likely to see more of these. Mrs. Romney will also increase her campaign appearances; she has already begun to talk about how women tell her they care deeply about the economy, where the campaign wants to keep its focus. Polls showed that as the Republican primary campaign dragged on, Mr. Romney began losing support with women, who may have been put off by the contest's focus on social issues like Planned Parenthood, immigration and contraception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Women voters are pocketbook voters, and the highest casualties of President Obama's failures on the economy have been among women,'' said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts. ''Governor Romney has a good record on women's issues. When he was in office, he was judged to have the best record of all governors in hiring women into senior positions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the campaign trail on Tuesday and Wednesday, Mr. Romney began highlighting how under Mr. Obama, women have suffered disproportionate job losses, repeatedly citing the figure of 92.3 percent, which he said was women's share of all the jobs lost since the president's inauguration in January 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The net number of jobs held by women has in fact fallen by 683,000 since Mr. Obama's inauguration, while those held by men have fallen by 57,000. But the statistic is misleading for several reasons. For one, while women have lost many jobs in the past three years, men lost far more jobs during the recession which officially started in December 2007, as men are disproportionately employed in industries sensitive to early swings in the business cycle, like manufacturing and construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the Romney campaign began aggressively fighting for women's votes, the Obama campaign was simultaneously preparing to make sure voters hear about every conservative stance -- especially those involving women's issues -- that Mr. Romney took during his party's bruising primary race. On Wednesday, they released a ''greatest hits'' video featuring some of his oft-repeated comments -- ''Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of that'' -- that will surely be repeated by his opponents as he tries to appeal to swing voters in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Women are the majority of the electorate, and they believe that Mitt Romney doesn't understand them and doesn't even care to try,'' said Stephanie Cutter, the deputy campaign manager of Mr. Obama's re-election team. ''He's absolutely right that women care about the economy, but that begs the question: Why did he skew his policies against them, and why did he spend so much time playing to the right wing by committing to get rid of Planned Parenthood and giving employers the right to deny women contraceptive coverage?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to focusing on the economy, Romney advisers said they would also play up the strong professional relationships Mr. Romney has had with women, including from his time as governor. They are considering both ads and testimonials from women -- including minorities -- who worked with him in the Statehouse, and have already started rolling out female surrogates to vouch for his record on women's issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said Mr. Romney's statement about pay equity was potentially troubling to conservatives who were already worried about Mr. Romney being sympathetic to issues like the Ledbetter Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It depends on if he was being Clintonian and saying something that can be interpreted in multiple ways, because every free market person will say they're in favor of equal pay,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''But the suspicion among free market people is that Romney won't contest the left's framing and narrative on this issue.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restore Our Future, a pro-Romney ''super PAC,'' is preparing to run positive ads reintroducing Mr. Romney to the electorate. If necessary, they will also run ads attacking Mr. Obama's record with women, mirroring the argument that Mr. Romney and his staff unveiled on the trail this week. Brandishing a glossy graphic in Hartford on Wednesday, Mr. Romney spoke at a women-owned business for the second straight day and cited a series of statistics that he said showed how Mr. Obama's economic policies have had a devastating impact on women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I was disappointed by listening to the president as he said, 'Oh, Republicans are waging a war on women,' '' Mr. Romney said at Alpha Graphics, a woman-owned commercial printing business. ''The real war on women is being waged by the president's failed economic policies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the coming days, the Romney campaign plans to lay out more details about the ''real'' war on women, especially as it relates to Mr. Romney's favorite topic -- jobs and the economy. The issue of energy, for instance, could be used to talk about how rising gas prices will affect soccer moms who need to drop their children at practice, or commute to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The point we're trying to make is that women should know exactly what this administration has done and what's happened to women in the workplace under this president's leadership,'' said Lanhee Chen, Mr. Romney's policy director. ''There is something unique about this recession that has hammered women in the work force.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Vice President Joe Biden tries to tie Mitt Romney directly to Republican opposition to higher taxes on millionaires. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. sought on Thursday to tie Mitt Romney directly to Republican opposition to higher taxes on millionaires, saying they want a &quot;Romney Rule&quot; that doubles down on tax cuts for the wealthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at an event in New Hampshire, Mr. Biden lashed out at Mr. Romney and Republicans in Congress  as the impediments to Democratic efforts to pass what they call the &quot;Buffett Rule&quot; for people who make more than $1 million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wealthy people are just as patriotic as middle-class people, as poor people, and they know they should be doing more,&quot; Mr. Biden said. &quot;We're not supposed to have a system with one set of rules for the wealthy and one set of rules for everyone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rhetorical assault is a direct attempt to tie Mr. Romney to the debate over the Buffett Rule on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are set to vote Monday. Mr. Romney is a multimillionaire who would be among the relatively small number of people to be affected if it is passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney acknowledged in January that most of his wealth is from investments that are taxed at lower rates than income from salary. That disparity would be changed if the Congress passes the rule being pushed by Mr. Obama and the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House has been pressing the case for the Buffett Rule -- named after Warren E. Buffett, the investor -- for much of the week. Mr. Obama has given several speeches on the subject. And the White House is directing people to its Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guess how many millionaires pay a lower tax rate than you [HINT: It's at least 5,000] Try our #BuffettRule calculator: wh.gov/buffett-rule,&quot; said a post from the official White House Twitter account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But aides to Mr. Obama are hoping that Mr. Biden's speech will begin to shift the debate about taxes on the wealthy from an abstraction to one that focuses directly on Mr. Romney. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In part, they hope to achieve that by using the term &quot;Romney Rule,&quot; which they believe will force Mr. Romney to acknowledge that opposing the president's proposals would benefit him personally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden's speech was also laden with direct references to Mr. Romney's personal wealth, a not-so-subtle reminder that Mr. Obama's re-election team intends to remind voters at every turn that he is worth millions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Romney calls the president out of touch,&quot; Mr. Biden said in his remarks. &quot;Hey, how many of y'all have a Swiss bank account?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The mystery involves the political consultant Dick Morris, Newt Gingrich and ads that never ran. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be one of the most expensive campaign refunds in history -- or an example of how tangled the trail of political money can be in the age of &quot;super PACs&quot; and unlimited donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend, Super PAC for America, a group founded by the political consultant Dick Morris that was active during the 2010 midterm elections, filed a routine quarterly disclosure with the Federal Election Commission. Largely dormant for the last year, Super PAC for America reported two donations during the first three months of 2012: a pair of checks totaling $500,000 from a second group called the League of American Voters, which has also been linked to Mr. Morris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The checks came on Jan. 24, a few days after Newt Gingrich won a rousing victory in the South Carolina Republican presidential primary and a week out from the Florida primary won by Mitt Romney. The same day the $500,000 arrived, Super PAC for America paid $289,100 to a media firm to reserve advertising time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ads do not appear to have ever run: Super PAC for America never filed independent-expenditure notices with the election commission. The media buy was refunded on Feb. 16. The following day,&nbsp; three weeks after the initial contribution, Super PAC for America refunded $500,000 to the League of American Voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an e-mail, Alexandra Preate, a Republican fund-raising consultant who is listed as a staff member on the league's Web site, suggested that the half-million-dollar donation to Super PAC for America had been made in error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We never really did contribute,&quot; Ms. Preate said. &quot;Our contribution was completely refunded almost immediately. The league has no current plans to be active with super PAC-election activity this year. Our focus remains on Congressional legislation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, another person with knowledge of the transaction said it might have been part of an abortive attempt to help Mr. Gingrich. At the time of the donation, he had decisively won the South Carolina contest, but was enduring a barrage of negative advertising in Florida from a pro-Romney super PAC, Restore Our Future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Preate did not answer further questions, posed in an e-mail, about the contribution. A call to the league, which shares an address in Washington with Americans for Tax Reform, the influential conservative antitax group, ended in the voice mail of yet another organization. Mr. Morris did not return an e-mail. The treasurer of Super PAC for America, Nancy H. Watkins, did not return a phone call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the league has heavily advertised on NewsMax, a conservative Web site founded by Christopher Ruddy for which Mr. Morris is a columnist. Mr. Ruddy has long been close with Mr. Gingrich: in late December, as the cash-strapped candidate was trying to fend off Restore Our Future attack ads leading up to the Iowa caucuses, NewsMax ran a 30-minute advertisement around the state lauding Mr. Gingrich as an heir to Ronald Reagan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, Mr. Ruddy noted that the League of American Voters was an advertiser on NewsMax and that he had a policy of not commenting about the site's advertisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And who provided the $500,000?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refunded donations underscore a major loophole in campaign law: while super PACs are required to disclose their donors, groups like the League of American Voters, a nonprofit &quot;social welfare&quot; group, are not -- meaning that the ultimate source of the $500,000 remains unknown. While such groups may not spend the bulk of their resources on election activity, they are permitted to donate to super PACs and other political entities without disclosing the underlying source of the money, which could be individuals, corporations, unions or other nonprofits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The League of American Voters, which was founded in the fall of 2009 and ran issue ads against President Obama's health care proposal, does not yet appear to have filed tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service or to have been granted tax-exempt status, though on its Web site it calls itself a 501(c)(4) organization. The league's Web site says it is dedicated to free enterprise and national security, but provides little other information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">President Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is off on Air Force One to attend the Summit of the Americas this weekend in the beautiful seaside city of Cartagena, Colombia.           Secretary of State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hillary &quot;The Texter&quot; Clinton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be taking her plane - then heading from there to meetings in Brasilia and Brussels.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Hill folks will also be headed to the quadrennial mega-gabfest to grip and grin with 30 or more other heads of government.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The fun will be to see how things go when they run into lefty anti-Americans such as Venezuela's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hugo Chavez</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">                          or Nicaragua's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Daniel Ortega</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">             .)          A couple of House congressional delegations - including a bipartisan group headed by House Foreign Affairs subcommittee chairman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Connie Mack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">(R-Fla.) - are packing to go. Also signed up are Reps. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">David Rivera</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">(R-Fla.), </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Albio Sires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">(D-N.J.), </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jeff Duncan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">(R-S.C.),                 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Henry Cuellar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">                          (D-Tex.), </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sheila Jackson Lee</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">(D-Tex.) and                 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sander M. Levin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">              (D-Mich.).          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curiously, not many senators seem to be going. In fact, it may be that the only one going from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Marco Rubio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (R-Fla.), a possible vice presidential pick, who we're told is flying commercial to attend.Seems as if he's going through a lot of trouble. &quot;Senator Rubio has pushed to promote democracy&quot; in the region, spokesman Alex Conant explained. &quot;This summit is a good opportunity for Senator Rubio to discuss the importance of democracy with leaders from around the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, if handled properly, it could also help boost his foreign-policy chops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reminds us of a foreign jaunt made by another potential vice presidential pick back in 2004. That would be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John Edwards</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose criminal trial is set to begin Thursday in Greensboro, N.C.           Edwards is charged with violating campaign finance laws related to the payment by two wealthy donors of nearly $1 million to help hide his pregnant mistress while he was running for president. (What was he going to do with her and the kid if he won?)          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwards gave a speech in June 2004 at the Bilderberg conference that was widely credited as one reason </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John Kerry</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">chose him.          Edwards told the uber-secret global power brokers of &quot;the insecurity of American workers that persists even when economic statistics&quot; get better, the New York Times reported. (Might be a theme for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mitt Romney</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">to pick up on if the economy is improving in the fall.)          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okay. So a nice shouting match with Hugo or Danny, appropriately videotaped, would be excellent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          The stuff that memesare made of          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Secretary of State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hillary Rodham Clinton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">             is embracing the viral &quot;Texts from Hillary&quot; meme - which mashed up a photo of a sunglasses-wearing Clinton with captions that imagine her text conversations with everyone from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mitt Romney</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ryan Gosling</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But not everyone was as thrilled, namely, the photographer who snapped the iconic image.                        </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Diana Walker</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the award-winning photographer who shot the picture while on assignment with Time magazine, was concerned when her photo started swirling around the Internet. She hadn't been asked, paid or credited for the use of her work, she says.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the story has a happy ending: The creators of the site finally added a credit line for the photos, and that's enough for Walker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm following Secretary Clinton's lead and being amused and taken with the idea that this picture is all over the world,&quot; she says. Still, she notes, the incident underscores the conflicts between photographers, who want to control their work, and the wide world of the Internet, where everything seems free. &quot;There needs to be a dialogue about this,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker insists that she didn't realize how powerful the image would be when she captured the black-and-white photo, which she - along with Reuters photographer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Kevin Lamarque</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who shot a color version that's also being used on the Tumblr site - took during a flight to Libya late last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And she wishes that people who want to grab photos from the Internet and use them for their own purposes would make an effort to contact their creators. &quot;Before they used it, how about a call to me?&quot; she asked. But, she admits, that might have resulted in no such memorable meme. &quot;I'm not sure I would have said yes.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Stop calling them 'rich'          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's Loop Quote of the Week award goes to former president </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">George W. Bush</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who  reminds us to use the proper terminology when referring to certain Americans who have more access to money than other Americans do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush spoke Tuesday at a tax-policy conference in New York hosted by his presidential institute. &quot;If you raise taxes on the so-called rich, you're really raising taxes on the job creators,&quot; he explained. So if you want &quot;private-sector growth,&quot; the best thing to do &quot;is to leave capital in the treasuries of the job creators,&quot; Bush said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We thought those folks were called &quot;rich&quot; because, well, they are. But that, apparently, is not the proper term. They are the &quot;job creators.&quot; So </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">President Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s deplorable class-warfare rhetoric pits the so-called poor and middle classes against the job-creator class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And don't try to sneak around that by calling them wealthy, bigwigs, plutocrats, oligarchs, fat cats, tycoons or robber barons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are the true working class, going 24-7 to create jobs for you and other ingrates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama is off on Air Force One to attend the Summit of the Americas this weekend in the beautiful seaside city of Cartagena, Colombia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary of State Hillary &quot;The Texter&quot; Clinton will be taking her plane - then heading from there to meetings in Brasilia and Brussels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Hill folks will also be headed to the quadrennial mega-gabfest to grip and grin with 30 or more other heads of government.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The fun will be to see how things go when they run into lefty anti-Americans such as Venezuela's Hugo Chavez or Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of House congressional delegations - including a bipartisan group headed by House Foreign Affairs subcommittee chairman Connie Mack(R-Fla.) - are packing to go. Also signed up are Reps. David Rivera(R-Fla.), Albio Sires(D-N.J.), Jeff Duncan(R-S.C.),Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.), Sheila Jackson Lee(D-Tex.) and Sander M. Levin(D-Mich.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curiously, not many senators seem to be going. In fact, it may be that the only one going from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a possible vice presidential pick, who we're told is flying commercial to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seems as if he's going through a lot of trouble. &quot;Senator Rubio has pushed to promote democracy&quot; in the region, spokesman Alex Conant explained. &quot;This summit is a good opportunity for Senator Rubio to discuss the importance of democracy with leaders from around the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, if handled properly, it could also help boost his foreign-policy chops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reminds us of a foreign jaunt made by another potential vice presidential pick back in 2004. That would be John Edwards, whose criminal trial is set to begin Thursday in Greensboro, N.C. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwards is charged with violating campaign finance laws related to the payment by two wealthy donors of nearly $1 million to help hide his pregnant mistress while he was running for president. (What was he going to do with her and the kid if he won?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwards gave a speech in June 2004 at the Bilderberg conference that was widely credited as one reason John Kerrychose him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwards told the uber-secret global power brokers of &quot;the insecurity of American workers that persists even when economic statistics&quot; get better, the New York Times reported. (Might be a theme for Mitt Romneyto pick up on if the economy is improving in the fall.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okay. So a nice shouting match with Hugo or Danny, appropriately videotaped, would be excellent.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The stuff that memesare made of</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is embracing the viral &quot;Texts from Hillary&quot; meme - which mashed up a photo of a sunglasses-wearing Clinton with captions that imagine her text conversations with everyone from Mitt Romney to Ryan Gosling. But not everyone was as thrilled, namely, the photographer who snapped the iconic image. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diana Walker, the award-winning photographer who shot the picture while on assignment with Time magazine, was concerned when her photo started swirling around the Internet. She hadn't been asked, paid or credited for the use of her work, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the story has a happy ending: The creators of the site finally added a credit line for the photos, and that's enough for Walker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm following Secretary Clinton's lead and being amused and taken with the idea that this picture is all over the world,&quot; she says. Still, she notes, the incident underscores the conflictsbetween photographers, who want to control their work, and the wide world of the Internet, where everything seems free. &quot;There needs to be a dialogue about this,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker insists that she didn't realize how powerful the image would be when she captured the black-and-white photo, which she - along with Reuters photographer Kevin Lamarque, who shot a color version that's also being used on the Tumblr site - took during a flight to Libya late last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And she wishes that people who want to grab photos from the Internet and use them for their own purposes would make an effort to contact their creators. &quot;Before they used it, how about a call to me?&quot; she asked. But, she admits, that might have resulted in no such memorable meme. &quot;I'm not sure I would have said yes.&quot; <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Stop calling them 'rich'</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's Loop Quote of the Week award goes to former president George W. Bush, who  reminds us to use the proper terminology when referring to certain Americans who have more access to money than other Americans do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush spoke Tuesday at a tax-policy conferencein New York hosted by his presidential institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If you raise taxes on the so-called rich, you're really raising taxes on the job creators,&quot; he explained. So if you want &quot;private-sector growth,&quot; the best thing to do &quot;is to leave capital in the treasuries of the job creators,&quot; Bush said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We thought those folks were called &quot;rich&quot; because, well, they are. But that, apparently, is not the proper term. They are the &quot;job creators.&quot; So President Obama's deplorable class-warfare rhetoric pits the so-called poor and middle classes against the job-creator class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And don't try to sneak around that by calling them wealthy, bigwigs, plutocrats, oligarchs, fat cats, tycoons or robber barons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are the true working class, going 24-7 to create jobs for you and other ingrates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;As Mitt Romney courts women, his campaign has difficulty on one key gender issue. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney's campaign scrambled Wednesday afternoon to clarify his support for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act after top aides were caught flat-footed by the question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Amanda Hennenberg, a campaign spokeswoman, said Mr. Romney &quot;supports pay equity and is not looking to change current law.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That came after top policy aides to the former Massachusetts governor seemed uncertain how to respond when a reporter asked about Mr. Romney's position on it during a campaign conference call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll get back to you on that,&quot; the adviser told reporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stumble comes as Mr. Romney's campaign is searching for ways to address the large lead that President Obama holds among female voters. That lead developed during the last several months, as Mr. Romney expressed positions that have angered many women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fumble on the Lilly Ledbetter law is not likely to help his case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, which makes it easier for women to sue in equal pay cases, was the first bill that Mr. Obama signed into law, just nine days after taking office. It is despised by conservatives who claim it is leading to a flurry of unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the law is hailed by many women's organizations as a step forward toward rectifying discriminatory salary situations. Democrats immediately jumped on the campaign's hesitance to support the law, quickly distributing audio of the conference call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he is truly concerned about women in this economy, he wouldn't have to take time to 'think' about whether he supports the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act,&quot; Ms. Ledbetter said in a statement distributed by Mr. Obama's campaign. &quot;This act not only ensures women have the tools to get equal pay for equal work, but it means their families will be better served also.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign reacted quickly, putting out statements from women attacking the impact of Mr. Obama's policies on women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama talks a good game on women in the economy, but the facts don't back him up,&quot; Representative Mary Bono Mack, Republican of California, said in a statement. &quot;Women in the Obama economy are facing hardships of historical proportions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic National Convention quickly noted that Ms. Bono Mack voted against the Ledbetter Act when it passed in Congress in 2009.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             GETTYSBURG, Pa.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three weeks ago, Rick Santorum chose this Civil War town to give a defiant speech about his need to stay in the presidential race, linking his struggle against Mitt Romney to &quot;the things that the people in this battlefield just down the road fought for.&quot;           Recalling the blood shed at Gettysburg, he exhorted more than 1,000 supporters: &quot;That's why we must go out and fight this fight.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Santorum thought he was George Meade rallying the Union forces,  he turned out to be leading Pickett's charge - the disastrous Confederate offensive here at which Gen. George Pickett lost half of his division and the war turned against the South. Santorum lost the Wisconsin and Maryland primaries, his poll numbers plunged, his money dried up, conservative and Republican Party leaders called on him to quit, and he canceled a string of campaign events.          After calling off his first two appearances Tuesday, Santorum rolled into the Gettysburg Hotel - the same spot where he gave his Gettysburg Address three weeks ago - for what the campaign had said in a Facebook posting would be a &quot;Rally for Rick.&quot; This time, however, he was bumped from the ballroom by a convention of district attorneys and had to settle for a small conference room with seats for 20 reporters.            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             Even in defeat, Santorum sounded defiant, not even mentioning Romney in his 15-minute speech. &quot;We made a decision over the weekend that while this presidential race for us is over for me, and we will suspend our campaign effective today, we are not done fighting,&quot; he announced, standing with some family members in front of a wrinkled American flag (an aide brought an iron, but there hadn't been enough time to use it).          Recalling his &quot;game on!&quot; exclamation after the Iowa caucuses, Santorum added: &quot;I know a lot of folks are going to write, maybe those even at the White House, 'game over.' But this game is a long, long, long way from over.&quot;           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for all the tough talk, Santorum's once-fiery presidential bid went out like a candle Tuesday here in his home state. His campaign, always a shoestring operation, lacked the finances and organization to keep pace with Romney for the Republican nomination. The campaign spent its final day in typical disarray. After a long weekend off while Santorum's young daughter Bella was treated in a hospital, the campaign canceled Tuesday's events overnight - so late that aides neglected to update the schedule on his Web site. Several of Santorum's remaining supporters showed up at his morning event at a sportsman's club in Bedford, Pa., but found not so much as a Santorum sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign then scheduled its Gettysburg &quot;rally&quot; for 2 p.m. But this, too, turned out to be bad information. The few supporters who showed up were told by hotel workers that the event was only for the media. &quot;They advertise it that he's going to be here so you can see him!&quot; Santorum supporter Frank Johnston complained at the hotel's reception desk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the least of the complaints Santorum has been hearing. Sen. John McCain said last week that &quot;it's time for a graceful exit.&quot; Southern Baptist official Richard Land, who rallied a group of religious conservatives to endorse Santorum, said on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation&quot; that Santorum &quot;ought to seriously consider leaving the race.&quot; Even Newt Gingrich, who had attacked Romney savagely, has shifted to the past tense: &quot;Turns out he had more things to hit with than I did.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he faced defeat in Pennsylvania's April 24 primary, Santorum was disinclined to listen - right up until the time he took the stage Tuesday afternoon at a lectern still bearing his &quot;Join the Fight&quot; slogan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santorum flashed a goofy grin and raised his eyebrows as he entered. He spoke about his ill daughter, his grandfather in the coal mines, his sweater vests and topics from Iran to the &quot;moral enterprise that is America.&quot; The closest he came to supporting Romney was a vow to &quot;make sure that we defeat President Barack Obama.&quot; (He ignored shouted questions about whether he would endorse Romney.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his trademark bravado, he boasted of accomplishing &quot;things that no political expert would have ever expected.&quot; And he compared himself to another politician who once visited Gettysburg. &quot;What I tried to bring to the battle was what Abraham Lincoln brought to this battlefield back in 1863 on November 19th,&quot; Santorum said. &quot;He talked about this country being conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, Santorum, like Lincoln, spoke at Gettysburg. But it's a safe bet that the world will little note nor long remember Santorum's version.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now, many voters have heard that Mitt Romney once put the family dog, Seamus, in a crate and strapped him to the roof of a station wagon. But far fewer have heard that Romney and his sons once raced across a dark, placid lake on Jet Skis, &quot;Baywatch&quot;-style, to rescue strangers and their dog, McKenzie, after their boat capsized.          Or that Romney once temporarily closed the Boston headquarters of his private-equity firm to round up his co-workers, accountants and lawyers and fan out across Manhattan to search for Melissa Gay, his Bain Capital partner's missing 14-year-old daughter.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or that as a volunteer lay pastor of his Mormon congregation, Romney spent years counseling neighbors on their marriages and adoptions, helping the unemployed feed their families, and ministering to the sick and the addicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lesser-known stories have surfaced occasionally in profiles of the former Massachusetts governor. But they have not blossomed into any kind of gentler portrait of Romney, who emerged as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Tuesday after challenger Rick Santorum suspended his bid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the campaign's focus shifting toward independent voters, especially women, a Washington Post-ABC News poll released this week found that President Obama holds a 2-to-1 advantage as the more friendly and likable of the two candidates.The long and divisive primary campaign has left Romney shackled by a caricature of a stilted, distant multimillionaire - a quandary that increasingly frustrates some of his advisers and even his wife, Ann.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Ann Romney recently was asked about her husband coming off as stiff, she said, &quot;I guess we better unzip him and let the real Mitt Romney out, because he is not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          She told a Baltimore radio station: &quot;It is so funny to me that that is the perception out there because he is funny, he is engaging, he is witty. He is always playing jokes. When I met him as a teenager, he was the life of the party.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Romney's softer side has not stuck with voters may be partly his campaign's fault. Until now, his advisers thought his personal anecdotes got in the way of his economic message - that tales of altruism would appear frivolous amid an anemic economic recovery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a 'Seinfeld' race,&quot; chief strategist Stuart Stevens said. &quot;This is not a race about nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People care about what you're going to do for them,&quot; he added. &quot;Will you be a strong leader? Will you be someone who is going to help me get a job? Will you be someone who's going to change the direction of the country? How off-putting is it when you meet someone for the first time and they pull out their family pictures and say, 'Let me tell you about my trip to the Grand Canyon'? No, you talk about mutual interests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knowing they are working with a private and sometimes uncomfortable man, Romney's advisers have not tried too hard to shape the public image of his personality. Instead, they have emphasized his managerial competency and economic plans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the reality is that, in modern presidential campaigns, voters expect a level of humanity and verve from their candidates. They gravitate toward those who seem relatable, as former Democratic nominees John F. Kerry and Al Gore learned the hard way. In every election since 1992, the more dynamic and down-to-earth candidate has won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, as Romney prepares to face Obama - who with his recent NCAA brackets has been working even harder than usual to be seen as an everyman - he is trying to open up. He plans to weave more personal anecdotes into his speeches, and he and his family are weighing when to sit down for major magazine and network television profiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign is beginning to expand the presence of Ann Romney, who offers moving testimony to her husband's constancy and character. She has narrated a series of videos about their home life featuring family snapshots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             In the latest video, titled &quot;Family&quot; and released Friday, she talks about her husband wrestling and throwing balls with their boys. &quot;Often I had more than five sons. I had six sons,&quot; she said. &quot;He would be as mischievous and as naughty as the other boys.&quot;So far, however, the candidate has been reluctant to let down his guard. When he visited &quot;The Tonight Show With Jay Leno&quot; recently, Romney began by talking about math. (He noted that he had picked up nine delegates in Guam and 20 in Puerto Rico.) One of his only jokes was about Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, making a good &quot;press secretary.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          At a town hall meeting last month in Ohio, a man told Romney, &quot;I know you have a heart&quot; and practically begged him to show it. But the candidate shared no specific anecdotes.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney is habitually cautious, and has said he knows that a single odd remark or misplaced metaphor can go viral and doom his candidacy. &quot;You're on all the time when you're running for office,&quot; he told Leno. &quot;Everything you say is being followed by, you know, a small camera of some kind that someone has.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Romney's advisers said there's another reason he's loath to tell personal stories. As Stevens put it, he has &quot;a natural aversion to that kind of braggadocio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Castellanos, who was Romney's media strategist in his 2008 presidential campaign but no longer works for him, said: &quot;He's a private man in a public world. These days, where every intimate thing in your life is somehow exposed on television, it's like Madonna. If it doesn't happen in front of people, it didn't happen. But Mitt Romney is old school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's family and friends say that in private he can be warm, loose and endearingly goofy. Occasionally that side comes through in public, such as when he made light of a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parody of him as being &quot;raw and unleashed.&quot; The next morning, as he passed out sandwiches at a New Hampshire diner, he quipped, &quot;This is me, just raw and unleashed.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But usually Romney sticks to his script. The few times he has chatted casually with reporters aboard his campaign plane, such as sharing family traditions like meatloaf cakes on his birthday, his aides required that the exchanges be off the record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the trail this year, Romney has not spoken of his 2003 rescue of a family from a sinking boat on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. It was Fourth of July weekend and Romney and two of his sons, Josh and Craig, were cleaning up the beach when they heard screams coming from the lake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romneys hopped on their Jet Skis and, together with a few other good Samaritans, ferried the six passengers and their dog, who had been vacationing from New Jersey, back to shore. The story made headlines across New England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the exhaustive search operation Romney helmed in 1996 to find his Bain Capital partner's daughter, he has spoken of it just once this year - and only after an Ohio voter asked him to. The story is perhaps better known among voters, however, because Romney made a television advertisement about it during his 2008 race, and a pro-Romney super PAC, Restore Our Future, has aired a similar ad this year in some states.As Romney told it, Robert Gay's daughter had gone to a party in New York City without permission and had not returned home to Connecticut. Immediately, Romney shut down Bain Capital's Boston headquarters and set up a command center at a New York hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had clerks at Duane Reade drugstores stuff fliers featuring a photo of the girl into shopping bags, and he and his team fanned out to find her. &quot;There we were, a bunch of folks in suits walking around in the parks of New York and in the streets and showing pictures and saying, when we saw teenagers, 'Have you seen this girl?' &quot; Romney recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After their efforts made the local news, someone called the hotline Romney set up asking for a reward. He hung up, but Romney's team traced the call, went to his home in New Jersey and found Melissa in the basement.</SPAN></P>

Politics is not just about policy. It is about character and trust. Mitt Romney has told the policy part of the story, but that sense of who he is, and can you trust him to take you there, is important, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTYSBURG, Pa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three weeks ago, Rick Santorum chose this Civil War town to give a defiant speech about his need to stay in the presidential race, linking his struggle against Mitt Romney to &quot;the things that the people in this battlefield just down the road fought for.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalling the blood shed at Gettysburg, he exhorted more than 1,000 supporters: &quot;That's why we must go out and fight this fight.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Santorum thought he was George Meade rallying the Union forces,  he turned out to be leading Pickett's charge - the disastrous Confederate offensive here at which Gen. George Pickett lost half of his division and the war turned against the South. Santorum lost the Wisconsin and Maryland primaries, his poll numbers plunged, his money dried up, conservative and Republican Party leaders called on him to quit, and he canceled a string of campaign events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After calling off his first two appearances Tuesday, Santorum rolled into the Gettysburg Hotel - the same spot where he gave his Gettysburg Address three weeks ago - for what the campaign had said in a Facebook posting would be a &quot;Rally for Rick.&quot; This time, however, he was bumped from the ballroom by a convention of district attorneys and had to settle for a small conference room with seats for 20 reporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in defeat, Santorum sounded defiant, not even mentioning Romney in his 15-minute speech. &quot;We made a decision over the weekend that while this presidential race for us is over for me, and we will suspend our campaign effective today, we are not done fighting,&quot; he announced, standing with some family members in front of a wrinkled American flag (an aide brought an iron, but there hadn't been enough time to use it).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalling his &quot;game on!&quot; exclamation after the Iowa caucuses, Santorum added: &quot;I know a lot of folks are going to write, maybe those even at the White House, 'game over.' But this game is a long, long, long way from over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for all the tough talk, Santorum's once-fiery presidential bid went out like a candle Tuesday here in his home state. His campaign, always a shoestring operation, lacked the finances and organization to keep pace with Romney for the Republican nomination. The campaign spent its final day in typical disarray. After a long weekend off while Santorum's young daughter Bella was treated in a hospital, the campaign canceled Tuesday's events overnight - so late that aides neglected to update the schedule on his Web site. Several of Santorum's remaining supporters showed up at his morning event at a sportsman's club in Bedford, Pa., but found not so much as a Santorum sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign then scheduled its Gettysburg &quot;rally&quot; for 2 p.m. But this, too, turned out to be bad information. The few supporters who showed up were told by hotel workers that the event was only for the media. &quot;They advertise it that he's going to be here so you can see him!&quot; Santorum supporter Frank Johnston complained at the hotel's reception desk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the least of the complaints Santorum has been hearing. Sen. John McCain said last week that &quot;it's time for a graceful exit.&quot; Southern Baptist official Richard Land, who rallied a group of religious conservatives to endorse Santorum, said on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation&quot; that Santorum &quot;ought to seriously consider leaving the race.&quot; Even Newt Gingrich, who had attacked Romney savagely, has shifted to the past tense: &quot;Turns out he had more things to hit with than I did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he faced defeat in Pennsylvania's April 24 primary, Santorum was disinclined to listen - right up until the time he took the stage Tuesday afternoon at a lectern still bearing his &quot;Join the Fight&quot; slogan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santorum flashed a goofy grin and raised his eyebrows as he entered. He spoke about his ill daughter, his grandfather in the coal mines, his sweater vests and topics from Iran to the &quot;moral enterprise that is America.&quot; The closest he came to supporting Romney was a vow to &quot;make sure that we defeat President Barack Obama.&quot; (He ignored shouted questions about whether he would endorse Romney.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his trademark bravado, he boasted of accomplishing &quot;things that no political expert would have ever expected.&quot; And he compared himself to another politician who once visited Gettysburg. &quot;What I tried to bring to the battle was what Abraham Lincoln brought to this battlefield back in 1863 on November 19th,&quot; Santorum said. &quot;He talked about this country being conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, Santorum, like Lincoln, spoke at Gettysburg. But it's a safe bet that the world will little note nor long remember Santorum's version.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now, many voters have heard that Mitt Romney once put the family dog, Seamus, in a crate and strapped him to the roof of a station wagon. But far fewer have heard that Romney and his sons once raced across a dark, placid lake on Jet Skis, &quot;Baywatch&quot;-style, to rescue strangers and their dog, McKenzie, after their boat capsized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or that Romney once temporarily closed the Boston headquarters of his private-equity firm to round up his co-workers, accountants and lawyers and fan out across Manhattan to search for Melissa Gay, his Bain Capital partner's missing 14-year-old daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or that as a volunteer lay pastor of his Mormon congregation, Romney spent years counseling neighbors on their marriages and adoptions, helping the unemployed feed their families, and ministering to the sick and the addicted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lesser-known stories have surfaced occasionally in profiles of the former Massachusetts governor. But they have not blossomed into any kind of gentler portrait of Romney, who emerged as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Tuesday after challenger Rick Santorum suspended his bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the campaign's focus shifting toward independent voters, especially women, a Washington Post-ABC News poll released this weekfound that President Obama holds a 2-to-1 advantage as the more friendly and likable of the two candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long and divisive primary campaign has left Romney shackled by a caricature of a stilted, distant multimillionaire - a quandary that increasingly frustrates some of his advisers and even his wife, Ann.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Ann Romney recently was asked about her husbandcoming off as stiff, she said, &quot;I guess we better unzip him and let the real Mitt Romney out, because he is not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told a Baltimore radio station: &quot;It is so funny to me that that is the perception out there because he is funny, he is engaging, he is witty. He is always playing jokes. When I met him as a teenager, he was the life of the party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Romney's softer side has not stuck with voters may be partly his campaign's fault. Until now, his advisers thought his personal anecdotes got in the way of his economic message - that tales of altruism would appear frivolous amid an anemic economic recovery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a 'Seinfeld' race,&quot; chief strategist Stuart Stevens said. &quot;This is not a race about nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People care about what you're going to do for them,&quot; he added. &quot;Will you be a strong leader? Will you be someone who is going to help me get a job? Will you be someone who's going to change the direction of the country? How off-putting is it when you meet someone for the first time and they pull out their family pictures and say, 'Let me tell you about my trip to the Grand Canyon'? No, you talk about mutual interests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knowing they are working with a private and sometimes uncomfortable man, Romney's advisers have not tried too hard to shape the public image of his personality. Instead, they have emphasized his managerial competency and economic plans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the reality is that, in modern presidential campaigns, voters expect a level of humanity and verve from their candidates. They gravitate toward those who seem relatable, as former Democratic nominees John F. Kerry and Al Gore learned the hard way. In every election since 1992, the more dynamic and down-to-earth candidate has won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, as Romney prepares to face Obama - who with his recent NCAA brackets has been working even harder than usual to be seen as an everyman - he is trying to open up. He plans to weave more personal anecdotes into his speeches, and he and his family are weighing when to sit down for major magazine and network television profiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign is beginning to expand the presence of Ann Romney, who offers moving testimony to her husband's constancy and character. She has narrated a series of videos about their home life featuring family snapshots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest video, titled &quot;Family&quot; and released Friday, she talks about her husband wrestling and throwing balls with their boys. &quot;Often I had more than five sons. I had six sons,&quot; she said. &quot;He would be as mischievous and as naughty as the other boys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, however, the candidate has been reluctant to let down his guard. When he visited &quot;The Tonight Show With Jay Leno&quot; recently, Romney began by talking about math. (He noted that he had picked up nine delegates in Guam and 20 in Puerto Rico.) One of his only jokes was about Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, making a good &quot;press secretary.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a town hall meeting last month in Ohio, a man told Romney, &quot;I know you have a heart&quot; and practically begged him to show it. But the candidate shared no specific anecdotes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney is habitually cautious, and has said he knows that a single odd remark or misplaced metaphor can go viral and doom his candidacy. &quot;You're on all the time when you're running for office,&quot; he told Leno. &quot;Everything you say is being followed by, you know, a small camera of some kind that someone has.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Romney's advisers said there's another reason he's loath to tell personal stories. As Stevens put it, he has &quot;a natural aversion to that kind of braggadocio.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney's attempt to pull off a victory in Rick Santorum's home state of Pennsylvania was all set to go into overdrive Monday with attack ads highlighting how voters there soundly rejected him in his 2006 Senate race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the aggressive tactics that have served Mr. Romney so well in other states faced an unexpected complication: the emergency hospitalization of Mr. Santorum's disabled daughter Bella, which prompted an outpouring of public sympathy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney camp abruptly pulled the ads on Monday morning. Bella, 3, who was born with a rare chromosomal disorder, was expected to return home soon to Virginia from the hospital, the Santorum campaign said. Her medical struggles, which in some ways have become the emotional centerpiece of Mr. Santorum's race, have the potential to complicate Mr. Romney's effort to quickly end the Republican nominating fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The family has been humbled and overwhelmed by the amount of support they've received,'' said a spokesman for Mr. Santorum's campaign, Hogan Gidley, citing thousands of comments on the candidate's Facebook page and e-mailed ''prayer chains.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum's decision to cancel campaign events to be with his daughter after she was hospitalized on Friday with pneumonia -- her second bout since January -- intensified speculation that he would choose the moment to exit the race gracefully, as a chorus of Republican leaders have urged for the sake of party unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Gidley doused that notion. Mr. Santorum planned to return to campaigning in the south-central Pennsylvania town of Bedford with a rally on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The fact is, there is still a narrow path, but a path nonetheless, for Rick Santorum to become the nominee, and the Romney campaign knows it or they wouldn't be sending people all over Pennsylvania and Texas to prevent it,'' Mr. Gidley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad the Romney campaign pulled, after it ran at least 11 times in the Philadelphia media market, according to Kantar Media's campaign media analysis group, bluntly addressed Pennsylvania voters: ''We fired him as senator. Why promote him to president?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign substituted a positive ad ''out of deference'' to Mr. Santorum, a spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once Bella is released from the hospital, the Romney campaign is expected to put the anti-Santorum ad back into its rotation, although that could take a day or two. The Romney campaign has planned a $2.9 million barrage of advertising over the next two weeks in Pennsylvania, which Mr. Santorum has called a must-win contest, although polls show him losing ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Roddey, chairman of the Republican Committee of Allegheny County, who has endorsed Mr. Romney, said the campaign probably would conduct polling to see whether Bella's hospitalization remained a sensitive issue. But, he said, sympathy for Bella would probably not bring Mr. Santorum any new votes, nor would it deter the Romney camp from full-throated attacks on Mr. Santorum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He's still not talking about the kinds of things most people are most concerned about, jobs and the economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bella, who was born with trisomy 18, a rare disorder that is fatal to most of children within their first year, has become a touchstone for Mr. Santorum, both humanizing him and serving as flashpoint for debate over health care with President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum mentions her at almost every appearance, sometimes explaining that his wife is not at his side because she is home caring for her, and sometimes, especially in churches, telling of how when Bella was born, doctors sent her home to die because her disorder was ''incompatible with life.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It angered us to hear that,'' Mr. Santorum explains in a video on his campaign Web site. ''She was our daughter like every one of our children and we were not going to let her go.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many voters find Mr. Santorum's brand of social conservatism and his speaking style off-putting, it is clear at rallies that Bella softens him. Audiences listen raptly to his descriptions, sometimes wiping away tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trisomy 18 results in stillbirth for about half the babies carried to term, and 90 percent of children die before their first birthday, said Dr. Robert Marion, chief of genetics and developmental medicine at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the first birthday the survival odds increase, he said, although pneumonia is a common cause of hospitalization because trisomy 18 children often have congenital heart diseases that cause fluid to build up in the lungs, causing infections. The condition has become rarer in the past 25 years, Dr. Marion said, ''because people are diagnosing it prenatally and terminating the pregnancies more often now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is one of the reasons Mr. Santorum cites Bella in his campaign -- an embodiment of his respect for the sanctity of life and a reason he opposes Mr. Obama's health care overhaul. He opposes its requirement that insurance plans cover prenatal screenings, principally amniocentesis, which he said are used to ''cull'' fetuses with birth defects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The procedures ''are done by and large to find out late in pregnancy whether the child in the womb has a disability,'' Mr. Santorum said in Ohio in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''And as we all know, 90 percent of Down syndrome children in this country are aborted once the mother and father find out that child is going to be less than what they were expecting.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also maintained that the 2010 health care law, because it was designed in part to slow runaway costs, would lead to ''a brave new world'' in which doctors are pressured to ration care, and disabled children like his daughter would be denied care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Marion, whose program sees about 7,500 children a year with developmental disabilities, said most health insurance does not cover many services the children need and that currently ''the government has washed their hands'' and there is no public financing for them either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's not a matter of these kids being squeezed because there's pressure on the person providing the care,'' he said. ''What happens is we're going to have to turn away some kids with trisomy 18 because there's nobody to pay for it.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3:08 p.m. | Updated Rick Santorum suspended his presidential campaign on Tuesday, bowing to the inevitability of Mitt Romney's nomination and ending his improbable, come-from-behind quest to become the party's conservative standard-bearer in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We made a decision over the weekend, that while this presidential race for us is over, for me, and we will suspend our campaign today, we are not done fighting,&quot; Mr. Santorum said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum made the announcement at a stop in his home state of Pennsylvania after a weekend in which he tended to his 3-year-old daughter, Bella, who had been hospitalized with pneumonia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum, who was holding back tears, did not exactly specify why he was ending his presidential bid. He referred to his daughter's illness, but said she was making great progress and was back home after being hospitalized over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum called Mr. Romney earlier in the day to tell him of his plans to suspend his campaign. Mr. Santorum told Mr. Romney that he is committed to defeating President Obama, but that he is not going to endorse immediately, said a source familiar with the call. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum made no mention of Mr. Romney in a 12-minute speech in which he extolled the people he had met during the campaign and said he was inspired by their stories of struggle and faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After spending months accusing Mr. Romney of being a weak challenger for President Obama, Mr. Santorum said only that he would continue to fight to elect a Republican president and to ensure Republican control of Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This game is a long, long, long way from over,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney issued a statement moments after Mr. Santorum concluded his remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Santorum is an able and worthy competitor, and I congratulate him on the campaign he ran,&quot; Mr. Romney said. &quot;He has proven himself to be an important voice in our party and in the nation.  We both recognize that what is most important is putting the failures of the last three years behind us and setting America back on the path to prosperity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As recently as December, Mr. Santorum was operating a shoestring campaign in Iowa, traveling with just a handful of aides in a pickup truck. But his brand of conservative populism caught fire in Iowa, where he defeated Mr. Romney. And then it caught fire again in several Midwest primaries in which he surprised Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ultimately, Mr. Santorum's campaign struggled under a nearly constant barrage of negative ads paid for by Mr. Romney and the &quot;super PAC&quot; supporting him, Restore Our Future, which has spent millions in an effort to ensure that Mr. Romney captures the nomination in his second attempt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum's withdrawal abruptly upends not only the political calculus for Mr. Romney and his campaign team, but also their financial picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates had faced fund-raising challenges in the coming weeks, with Mr. Santorum limping by on fumes and Mr. Romney rapidly tapping his top contributors for the maximum contribution, challenging him to seek out new sources of cash. Mr. Romney had committed $2.9 million to the Pennsylvania primary, hoping to deliver Mr. Santorum a knockout blow, and Restore Our Future had begun spending there as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum's withdrawal will allow both Mr. Romney and the super PAC to redirect that money to other states, either to head off any lingering challenge from Newt Gingrich and Representative Ron Paul of Texas, or to begin preparing for what seems to be an increasingly likely general election matchup against Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former congressman and senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum had built a reputation as an unwavering social conservative whose opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage helped catapult him into national office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the people who had been publicly encouraging Mr. Santorum to reconsider a drawn-out challenge to Mr. Romney were some evangelical leaders who had been suspicious of Mr. Romney's commitment to their most important causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Land, the president of the ethics commission at the Southern Baptist Convention, said as much an hour before word of Mr. Santorum's decision reached the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As his friend, I would say, you know you've done an incredible job resurrecting your career. You've done better than anybody thought you could,&quot; Mr. Land told reporters and editors of The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Land said that if Mr. Santorum pressed ahead, he would jeopardize that success. And he said that Mr. Santorum had a good future if he acknowledged Mr. Romney's claim to the nomination this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In eight years, Rick Santorum will be three years younger than  Romney is now. He's only 53 years old,&quot; Mr. Land said. &quot;He'll be a significant player. I would think he could have a significant role in a Romney administration if he wanted to. Maybe H.H.S. secretary?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ralph Reed, a leading social conservative who oversees the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said Mr. Santorum had proved himself as the strongest insurgent conservative candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was an impressive performance and it leaves him with an elevated status and a prominent role as a leader for evangelicals and conservatives,&quot; Mr. Reed said on Tuesday. &quot;No one can know what the future holds, but my guess is we haven't heard the last from Rick Santorum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum's candidacy benefited from the comparison to Mr. Romney as the Republican candidates appealed to a conservative segment of the Republican Party during the primary process. Mr. Santorum regularly mocked Mr. Romney as a flip-flopper on social and conservative issues who could not be trusted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That helped Mr. Santorum win several Southern primaries in which evangelical voters and Tea Party supporters dominated the primary electorate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Santorum also cast himself as the true economic conservative who understood the needs of the middle class. His campaign attacked Mr. Romney, a multimillionaire, as out of touch with the needs and interests of regular working Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum's quick rise in the polls also led to repeated gaffes that knocked him off that economic message and pulled him back into an extended conversation about contraception and other social issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those issues did not play as well in states like Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois, where Mr. Santorum lost to Mr. Romney. Those losses helped create a mounting sense of frustration inside the Republican establishment that Mr. Santorum was waging a quixotic battle against Mr. Romney that would ultimately hurt the party's chances against Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum's decision will all but clear the way for Mr. Romney to claim the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gingrich recently scaled back his ambitions, acknowledging that it was impossible for him to accumulate enough delegates to win the nomination before the national convention. Mr. Gingrich conceded on Sunday that Mr. Romney would most likely be the nominee, and said his primary goal in continuing to campaign was to influence the party's platform at the convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gingrich released a statement praising Mr. Santorum and his campaign, but also stressing his commitment to remaining in the race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am committed to staying in this race all the way to Tampa so that the conservative movement has a real choice,&quot; the statement read. &quot;I humbly ask Senator Santorum's supporters to visit Newt.org to review my conservative record and join us as we bring these values to Tampa. We know well that only a conservative can protect life, defend the Constitution, restore jobs and growth and return to a balanced budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Paul also is continuing to wage his effort to win the Republican nomination and is scheduled to campaign this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Santorum had been the last remaining candidate with a potential shot at stopping Mr. Romney - and even that opportunity was dwindling fast as Mr. Romney accumulated delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials at the Republican National Committee had already begun considering the possibilities for beginning the traditional effort to merge their general election efforts with  Mr. Romney's Boston-based campaign. The decision by Mr. Santorum will make that easier. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also could clear the way for Mr. Santorum to play a bigger role - and have a potentially bigger voice - in Mr. Romney's campaign and perhaps in a Romney administration.</SPAN></P>
