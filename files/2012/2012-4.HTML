<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A majority of voters who know GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney is a Mormon say they're comfortable with his faith, but doubts about President Obama's religion persist, according to a Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life poll. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than half, or 49%, of registered voters correctly identified Obama as a Christian. In the fourth year of Obama's presidency, 17% say he is Muslim, the Pew poll says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six in 10 registered voters who know Romney is a Mormon say they are comfortable with his religion, according to the Pew poll released Thursday. Twenty-one percent say it doesn't matter to them. Among white evangelical voters, 23% say they're uncomfortable with Romney's religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Super PAC pulls ad using Olympics video</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Democratic super PAC that used footage from the 2002 Olympics to slam Mitt Romney has taken down a Web video at the request of the U.S. Olympic Committee and shelved a related TV ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priorities USA Action, which supports President Obama, had posted the video of Romney and international athletes at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics to illustrate Democratic charges that Romney's Bain Capital moved jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Committee, asked all sides to refrain from using Olympic themes in political ads. &quot;While we are absolutely confident that neither presidential candidate nor campaign has participated in the production or distribution of these negative ads, the attacks using Olympic themes and images need to stop,&quot; Sandusky said. <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember the 2,008 exquisitely synchronized drummers at the opening of the Beijing Games? In London, look for a flock of sheep, three cows, two goats and 10 waddling ducks. Where there were choreographed Chinese philosophers reenacting the invention of the printing press, expect James Bond in a helicopter. And where dragons lurked in the Bird's Nest stadium, watch out for a Voldemort-vs.-Mary Poppins smackdown inside the glistening new Olympic Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But besides the undeniable stamp of British whimsy on a sporting event so often viewed in reverential terms, perhaps the biggest difference at Friday's Opening Ceremonies of the 2012 London Games will be the Olympic stadium itself. In stark contrast with the monument to millennial greatness that was the Bird's Nest in Beijing, the humbler main venue nestled inside a reclaimed urban wasteland in East London is largely collapsible, with a comparatively tiny permanent core of just 25,000 seats.          As a global audience prepares for nearly three weeks of competition set against the backdrop of one of the world's most recognizable cities, it speaks to the wholly different mission of the London Games: to bring the ponderous, politicized and outsize Olympics back down to Earth.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there is a bit of a responsibility on us to bring these Games down to size and return them to a game for athletes, to hand them on in such a condition that other countries elsewhere around the world who have not had the Games thus far feel like they can be comfortable bidding for them,&quot; said Hugh Robertson, Britain's minister for sports and the Olympics. &quot;I don't feel they should be exclusively the reserve of global superpowers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas China went for shock and awe, hosting the most expensive Olympics in history to herald its arrival on the world stage, a Britain locked in recession and fully aware that its grandest days are behind it is trying to do more with less. London's effort is set to be better attended than the Beijing Games while costing about half as much. In London and host cities across Britain, the 10,490 athletes from 205 nations will compete in more temporary stadiums this year than at the past three Summer Games combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, at a stated cost of at least $15 billion - or three times more than envisioned a decade ago - these are hardly the austerity games of London 1948, when visiting athletes were asked to bring their own food to a capital still healing from the Nazi blitz. The 2012 Games come during a renaissance of the only city to host the modern Olympics three times. This month's inauguration of the 1,016-foot Shard tower - the tallest building in the European Union, fitted with a five-star hotel and $80 million apartments - symbolized London's roaring rise into the playground of choice for Russian oligarchs, Saudi sheiks and American bankers even as much of the rest of Britain sinks deeper into the doldrums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, there is still grand ambition afoot. By concentrating Olympic construction in a blighted area of East London, Britain has ignited the most targeted Olympic-related explosion of urban redevelopment since the rebirth of Barcelona's waterfront in 1992. At the same time, organizers are tapping the Games to fuel Britain's resurgence as a cultural superpower. Particularly at the Opening and Closing ceremonies, this nation will remind the world that while its soldiers may be fighting and dying in Afghanistan, back home, this is still the Green and Pleasant Land of William Blake and Shakespeare, of Cruella de Vil and Captain Hook, of Queen Elizabeth II and Sir Paul McCartney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not the biggest country in the world, and we can't do a China-style Olympics, nor could we do something on the scale of the U.S.,&quot; said John Worne, director of strategy at the British Council, Britain's cultural promotion agency. &quot;But I think we can offer a celebration. What you're going to get, generally speaking, is an image of the U.K. as it is, warts and all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Spirit and antipathy          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a sunny day in the tough East London host borough of Newham last week, Ron Cooper, 84, carried the Olympic torch through cheering crowds with the aid of a walking stick and a heavy dose of personal gumption. A lightweight boxer representing Britain in the 1948 Games, as well as a cockney-accented curmudgeon, he embodies the schizophrenic sense of spirit and antipathy with which Londoners have embraced these Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, we've spent 9.3 billion pounds on it, so I guess we better go and watch now,&quot; said Cooper, with no hint of irony. &quot;It's just too many people and too much traffic, all security lines and nuisance. But I guess it's too late to turn back. After all this trouble, let's just hope these bloody Games end up being fantastic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the past few days are any guide, it may not be smooth sailing ahead. Before the Games have even officially begun, organizers chalked up their first major gaffe on Wednesday: They accidently ran up the South Korean flag for an early women's soccer match between North Korea and Colombia, leading the furious North Koreans to storm off the pitch. Overcrowding and signal failures at St. Pancras Station - the hub for travelers heading to the new Olympic Park - is already sparking transit backups.          &quot;Oh, how I wish Paris would have won,&quot; cabdriver John Reeder said while stuck in a traffic jam next to one of the many lanes across London reserved for Olympic VIPs.          Criticism and humor          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Britain facing an influx of 600,000 visitors and staging its biggest peacetime security operation ever, British Airways ran a series of &quot;Don't Fly&quot; ads begging jaded Londoners not to skip town for the Games. The British press - an outspoken and aggressive bunch about as far from China's state-controlled media as is humanly possible - has savaged the government and crucified the British contractor G4S for last-minute security-staffing mistakes. The BBC has derided the &quot;fat cats&quot; at the International Olympic Committee for spending lavishly on five-star hotels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tabloid columnists, politicians and average Londoners are bemoaning the raw commercial juggernaut that is the London Games, where corporate bigwigs scored the best tickets and only beer by sponsor Heineken can be sold at Olympic venues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney, in London for big-ticket fundraisers and to attend the Opening Ceremonies, also stirred things up by seeming to question London's Olympic spirit and readiness during a round of media interviews. In response, a defensive Prime Minister David Cameron alluded to the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, which Romney ran, by saying, &quot;Of course, it's easier if you hold an Olympic Games in the middle of nowhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miffed by the Republican presidential candidate's comments, the saucy Daily Mail retorted, &quot;Who invited him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the English brought something else to the fiercely serious Olympics besides a litany of complaints: British humor. Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley, stars of the British comedy &quot;Absolutely Fabulous,&quot; debuted an Olympic special this week where they drunkenly ran around the main venue's track. A new series called &quot;Twenty Twelve&quot; is spoofing earnest Olympic organizers and envisioning such irreverent mishaps as the Opening Ceremony fireworks setting off the military's surface-to-air missiles stationed around the Olympic Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday night, the eclectic Opening Ceremonies - bringing together the likes of Michelle Obama, Angelina Jolie and David Beckham - will be in the dangerous hands of Danny Boyle, the British director famed for movies about Scottish heroin addicts and a game-show-winning Indian slum dweller.          The message? Dorothy, we're not in Beijing anymore.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Come on, this is Britain. We're not going to do thousands of marching Chinese,&quot; said Jon Plowman, executive producer of the BBC show &quot;Twenty Twelve.&quot; &quot;There's just something about the British character that isn't good at getting all excited about something like the Olympics. You have this thing in America of being all gung-ho and saying, 'Oh, this is going to be great,' and 'Yes, we can.' But we're not like that. We say, 'Well, yes, we </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">might</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It rather depends on the weather.' &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, how I wish Paris would have won,&quot; cabdriver John Reeder said while stuck in a traffic jam next to one of the many lanes across London reserved for Olympic VIPs.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Criticism and humor</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Britain facing an influx of 600,000 visitors and staging its biggest peacetime security operation ever, British Airways ran a series of &quot;Don't Fly&quot; ads begging jaded Londoners not to skip town for the Games. The British press - an outspoken and aggressive bunch about as far from China's state-controlled media as is humanly possible - has savaged the government and crucified the British contractor G4S for last-minute security-staffing mistakes. The BBC has derided the &quot;fat cats&quot; at the International Olympic Committee for spending lavishly on five-star hotels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tabloid columnists, politicians and average Londoners are bemoaning the raw commercial juggernaut that is the London Games, where corporate bigwigs scored the best tickets and only beer by sponsor Heineken can be sold at Olympic venues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney, in London for big-ticket fundraisers and to attend the Opening Ceremonies, also stirred things up by seeming to question London's Olympic spirit and readiness during a round of media interviews. In response, a defensive Prime Minister David Cameron alluded to the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, which Romney ran, by saying, &quot;Of course, it's easier if you hold an Olympic Games in the middle of nowhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miffed by the Republican presidential candidate's comments, the saucy Daily Mail retorted, &quot;Who invited him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the English brought something else to the fiercely serious Olympics besides a litany of complaints: British humor. Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley, stars of the British comedy &quot;Absolutely Fabulous,&quot; debuted an Olympic special this week where they drunkenly ran around the main venue's track. A new series called &quot;Twenty Twelve&quot; is spoofing earnest Olympic organizers and envisioning such irreverent mishaps as the Opening Ceremony fireworks setting off the military's surface-to-air missiles stationed around the Olympic Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday night, the eclectic Opening Ceremonies - bringing together the likes of Michelle Obama, Angelina Jolie and David Beckham - will be in the dangerous hands of Danny Boyle, the British director famed for movies about Scottish heroin addicts and a game-show-winning Indian slum dweller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message? Dorothy, we're not in Beijing anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Come on, this is Britain. We're not going to do thousands of marching Chinese,&quot; said Jon Plowman, executive producer of the BBC show &quot;Twenty Twelve.&quot; &quot;There's just something about the British character that isn't good at getting all excited about something like the Olympics. You have this thing in America of being all gung-ho and saying, 'Oh, this is going to be great,' and 'Yes, we can.' But we're not like that. We say, 'Well, yes, we might. It rather depends on the weather.' &quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Olympic Committee has a message for the presidential candidates and their supporters: Leave the Games out of your politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee Thursday criticized an ad released Wednesday by Priorities USA Action, the super PAC supporting President Obama, that made ample use of old Olympics footage of Mitt Romney at the 2002 Winter Olympics. The spot poked fun at Romney's international investments and pointedly referred to foreign countries where Romney's former private-equity firm, Bain Capital, helped create jobs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was not exactly in line with the Olympic spirit, at least according to the USOC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Olympic Games are a celebration of friendship, excellence and respect. While we are absolutely confident that neither presidential candidate nor campaign has participated in the production or distribution of these negative ads, the attacks, using Olympic themes and images, need to stop,&quot; USOC spokesman Patrick Sandusky said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow we will celebrate America's finest athletes' accomplishments and watch Team USA march in the parade of nations,&quot; Sandusky added. &quot;For anything even remotely negative to be associated with that time-honored, inspirational moment would be extremely unfortunate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olympic footage is not just off-limits for attack ads. &quot;We will not allow Olympic footage to be used in any political ad, positive or negative, per the IOC's Olympic Charter,&quot; Sandusky said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restriction may spell bad news for Romney and his supporters, who point to the Republican candidate's stewardship of the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics as a key biographical selling point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign has already used Olympic imagery at least once. A Web video from last December, called &quot;Leader,&quot; refers to Romney's involvement in the Games and features a shot of him decked out in Olympic gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Burton, Priorities USA's co-founder, said that &quot;when we were assured Mitt Romney and his allies would be held to the same standard, we were more than happy to take the ad down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RICHMOND, Va. -- The man looks incredulous, his voice rising in exasperation as he tells President Obama to stop demonizing small-business owners. ''We need somebody who believes in America,'' he says, right before viewers hear, ''I'm Mitt Romney, and I approved this message.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes earlier on the same local NBC station here, anyone watching commercials between rounds of ''American Ninja Challenge'' would have seen Mr. Obama's latest attack. As Mr. Romney sings a monotone rendition of ''America the Beautiful'' at a campaign rally, headlines flash on the screen describing how he put his fortune in foreign bank accounts and shipped jobs to China and Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the presidential campaign has become a clash over a host of issues -- from tax cuts to foreign diplomacy to claims of words taken out of context -- Mr. Romney, Mr. Obama and their allies have started trading accusations over a much more delicate and personal question: Are you an American like me? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their choice of words and imagery is a reminder of how powerful undercurrents of identity, wealth, race and religion are shaping this election. These surface in subtle and not-so-subtle ways as two candidates who can have trouble connecting with voters on a personal level try to define each other as detached from mainstream American life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Mr. Romney's telling, the president has a ''strange'' and ''foreign'' political philosophy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has suggested that Mr. Romney's vision of the American dream involves Indian call centers and Caribbean tax havens. ''What is Mitt Romney hiding?'' asks one recent ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For two men with unconventional biographies -- one is the son of a Kenyan immigrant and the other a descendant of Mormon pioneers -- this is risky but potentially fertile territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's the 'Mars attacks' approach,'' said Ken Goldstein, president of Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group. ''And it often works because nothing brings the people of Earth together like an invasion from Mars.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using attack ads in heavy rotation across battleground states like Virginia, along with carefully worded campaign speeches and barbed sound bites on cable television, Mr. Obama, Mr. Romney and their supporters are pushing these competing story lines as polls show negative views of both men are on the rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither candidate is accusing the other of sending subliminal signals over race or religion. And the language on the campaign trail is a far cry from the overt efforts to make religion a wedge issue -- like the campaign by Representative Michele Bachmann and other Republican members of Congress to ferret out what they say is an Islamic extremist influence in government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, the Obama and Romney campaigns seem conscious of the dangers of going too far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''These two campaigns have gone to pretty considerable lengths to keep away from that kind of attack that relates either to Obama's race or Romney's religion,'' said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California and a former Republican consultant. ''What we're seeing is more like, He's really rich so he can't understand what your life is like,'' Mr. Schnur said of attacks on Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against Mr. Obama, he added, the tack is, ''He's never had a real job, so he can't understand how you built your business.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attack strategies against Mr. Obama have always been tricky to execute, not just because of possible racial tripwires but because a solid majority of voters say they like the president personally, whatever they may think of his politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The approach Mr. Romney has taken in recent weeks with increasing zeal seeks to avoid those sensitivities while planting doubts in voters' minds about Mr. Obama's fealty to America and its allies. Just this week, he accused the president of betraying ''the national interest'' by leaking national security secrets, and said in a CNBC interview that the president's ideology is ''very strange and in some respects foreign to the American experience type of philosophy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was referring to the president's recent statement that government investment has helped small businesses thrive, a comment that conservatives have pounced on as evidence that Mr. Obama is sympathetic to European-style social democracy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, a top supporter of Mr. Romney's, John H. Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor and White House chief of staff in the first Bush administration, said in remarks he was later forced to clarify, ''I wish this president would learn how to be an American.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, himself the subject of frequent attacks concerning his background, has tried to turn the tables somewhat, casting his opponent's business experience as hostile to American ideals: Sure, Mr. Romney sings about how much he loves America. But he gave American jobs to foreigners and hides his money in Swiss banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new ad from the Obama ''super PAC'' Priorities USA Action uses crafty editing to show Mr. Romney at the opening ceremony of the Salt Lake City Olympics, waving to the teams from China, India, Bermuda and Switzerland. ''China,'' the announcer scoffs. ''Thousands owe their jobs to Mitt Romney's companies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, the Obama campaign stresses the president's middle-class upbringing and Midwestern roots to draw a contrast with Mr. Romney. Mr. Obama grew up without privilege or prestige, his ads say. Raised by his grandparents, he had to borrow money to pay for college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or as the songwriter Carole King says in a new Web video: ''Rural America is part of his DNA. His mom and his grandparents were from Kansas.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney? One recent Obama&nbsp;ad says that when he was governor he raised fees on the backbone of the middle class: nurses, electricians and fishermen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The squabbles over who can lay claim to being a better American are the latest fodder for what has been a relentlessly negative television campaign. Kantar Media, which tracks television advertising nationwide, analyzed all the commercials related to the presidential race that ran from last Friday through Monday -- 22 different ones in all. Only three had a positive message, and they were all Spanish-language commercials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Richmond, a battleground state media market that is seeing some of the heaviest advertising, not a single positive presidential campaign message ran on television from June 9 through June 22, according to Kantar. But attack ads ran 4,504 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With time running out to break through to the few voters who remain undecided -- just 8 percent of the electorate by the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll -- it is all the more important that the campaigns find resonance with their appeals to Americans' patriotism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Voters are already turning off their televisions,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who cautioned that the torrent of negative messages is starting to overwhelm people. ''It's getting harder and harder to find a message that cuts through.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After  Federal Election Commission's filings  this month showed Mitt Romney outraised President Obama by a whopping $35million in June, Team Obama flooded donors in-boxes with messages that were notable for their dire tone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can win a race in which the other side spends more than we do,&quot; Obama wrote in a July 10 fundraising e-mail. &quot;But not this much more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Romney and sympathetic super PACs continue to significantly outraise Obama over the next four months,  most of that money will likely be poured into a barrage of advertising in swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a campaign in which both sides  could spend billions of dollars, some political analysts question whether a fundraising advantage is as meaningful as it once was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If each side raises the table stakes of $500 million, which certainly appears will happen, after that it's just going to be white noise and a lot of wasted advertising,&quot; said Mark McKinnon, a top strategist in George W. Bush's presidential campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with the sheer amount of money that both campaigns have at their disposal, voters in battleground states -- which are getting a bulk of the advertising attention -- are going to become anesthetized to the advertising long before both sides empty their coffers, says Matt Bennett, who served as campaign communications director to Al Gore's 2000 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has predicted that Romney and GOP-leaning groups will spend $1.2 billion. The Obama campaign, which won't offer estimates of what  it expects to raise in 2012, spent about $750 million in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is whether spending $1.2 billion is any different than spending $800 million,&quot; Bennett said. &quot;The answer is no, because you reach a saturation point after a certain point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Mellman, a veteran Democratic strategist, is more circumspect. Mellman said that there's an adage among campaign strategists that 80% of advertising dollars are wasted -- but strategists don't know which 80% that is until after they spend it, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we're sitting here like we were in 2000, and we find ourselves in a situation where we're saying, 'Geez, 500 votes made the difference in who is president and who is not.'  There's nobody who can say, 'I know for certain that a 1.5-to-1 or 2-to-1 differential in spending didn't matter' in that difference of 500 votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mellman adds that the advertising market is more fractured than ever, making it more complicated and expensive to reach voters. Long gone are the days where campaigns could make a huge ad buy during the three networks' evening news and reach 60% of the electorate, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign believes the fundraising advantage -- if it comes to fruition -- could give them an important edge in the final days of an election that is expected to be close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't want to be caught flat-footed and unable to close out a campaign,&quot; Romney pollster Neil Newhouse said. <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the pair of presidential candidates who must feel they have been campaigning forever -- after all, it's been nearly a year since the opening Iowa Straw Poll -- a milestone Sunday signals the final sprint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hundred days until Nov. 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a signal we're turning the corner,&quot; says David Axelrod, President Obama's chief strategist, calling it a &quot;psychological milestone.&quot; To mark the occasion, the Obama team plans more than 3,500 voter-registration and volunteer-recruitment events across the country Sunday, including &quot;BBQs for Barack&quot; in Ohio and Olympics-watching parties in Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Schmidt, a top adviser to Republican John McCain in 2008, notes that years of preparations and calculations by Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney now face a rapid-fire final test. &quot;People have been working on the Obama campaign since 2007, and this is the last race, the last campaign (for him). For Romney, a lot of those people have been working since 2006, 2007,&quot; he says. &quot;And they remember it's 100 days to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last 100 days present a great opportunity because that's when voters are paying the most attention,&quot; says Jonathan Collegio of American Crossroads, a pro-Romney super PAC. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the focus will be even tighter, on perhaps 10 hours within those 100 days: Romney's announcement of his running mate next month, the end-of-the-summer speeches delivered by Romney and Obama at the national political conventions, and the three presidential debates scheduled for October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some political scientists have devised academic models that downplay the significance of the campaign's final weeks in favor of broad political and economic forces. Alan Abramowitz of Emory University, for one, predicts the popular vote using just three factors, each already set: whether an incumbent president is running (yes), the sitting president's net approval rating in the final Gallup Poll in June (48% approval-46% disapproval) and the change in real GDP in the second quarter. The initial estimate of the nation's economic growth from April through June is due Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His model -- which accurately predicted the popular-vote winner in the past five elections -- calculates that Obama needs second-quarter growth of 1% or higher to win a majority of the popular vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's another: In nine of the past 10 elections, the candidate leading in the Gallup Poll taken closest to 100 days out has won the White House. (The exception was 1988, when the 100-day mark came a week after the Democratic convention had given Michael Dukakis a bump. It also came two weeks before the Republican convention nominated George H.W. Bush.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, with four days to go until the 100-day mark, Gallup's seven-day rolling survey put Romney at 46%, Obama at 45%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a time when Labor Day marked the beginning of the general-election campaign after a summertime lull. Now, presidential battles have expanded in time and increased in intensity, changing their rhythm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political conventions have been pushed later in the summer, but the advertising barrage starts earlier as both sides try to shape positive impressions of their candidate and negative impressions of their opponent. There's no longer a summer break: This month, an estimated $100 million worth of political ads have  aired in swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The endgame has changed, too. The expansion of early voting and no-excuse-needed absentee voting means more votes are cast earlier. And this year, for the first time, jurisdictions are required to send absentee ballots to active-duty military voters by late September. Political scientist Michael McDonald of George Mason University estimates that a third of all votes will be cast before any polls open on Nov. 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our 72-hour campaign (to get out the vote) has become a 72-day campaign,&quot; says Sean Spicer of the Republican National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigns  have strategies in hand, ads in mind and travel schedules blocked -- subject to change as key states become more or less competitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The groundwork has been laid for the train going forward,&quot; says Bill Burton, a veteran of Obama's 2008 campaign who now helps run a supportive super PAC, Priorities USA Action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, unexpected events could intervene. Days before the 2000 election, the disclosure of a drunken-driving arrest in Maine from a quarter-century earlier rattled George W. Bush's campaign. In 2004, Osama bin Laden released a tape in the campaign's final days in which he admitted for the first time that he was behind  the 9/11 attacks, reviving fears of terrorism among some voters -- a boost for Bush. In 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection on Sept. 15, stoking a financial crisis and, Axelrod says, putting the candidates' leadership on display in a way that clinched the election for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are moments we know to expect, and that are likely to matter, over the next 100 days. Here is a reader's guide to five of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jockeying at the Olympics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In London on Friday, Michelle Obama will lead the official U.S. delegation at the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games, typically an event marked by national unity and pride. Mitt Romney will be there as well, a reminder to voters of his success in turning around the troubled Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002. Ann Romney will stick around to see the horse she co-owns, Rafalca, perform in the dressage competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The London stop is the start of a three-nation tour by Romney designed to show his potential as a credible commander in chief, meeting with foreign leaders and discussing international policy on a global stage. He is scheduled to meet with British Prime Minister David Cameron, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. He'll deliver speeches in Israel and Poland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama took a seven-nation world tour of his own at this point in the campaign four years ago -- to Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney outlined his foreign-policy case against Obama in a speech Tuesday in Reno at the Veteran of Foreign Wars Convention, a group the president had addressed the day before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I pledge to you that if I become commander in chief, the United States of America will fulfill its duty, and its destiny,&quot; Romney told them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jobs, jobs, jobs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History says the unemployment report for July, released at the end of next week, will do more to shape November's outcome than those that follow. That's because election-year perceptions of the economy begin to be firmly set in the summer -- and the economy is driving this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There comes a point at which judgment is formed as opposed to just an opinion, and it's hard to reverse a judgment,&quot; says Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to Romney. &quot;The last unemployment report was important, and the one in August will be important, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider 1992, when the elder President Bush was running for re-election as the nation was pulling out of a recession. The jobless rate peaked at 7.8% in June and was almost as high, 7.7%, in July. It steadily ticked down after that, to 7.3% by October, but Bush tried in vain to convince Americans  things really were getting better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic challenger Bill Clinton ridiculed the president's reassurances in an attack ad that fall.  He won in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the October jobs report is scheduled to be released on Nov. 2,  four days before the election. Other important measures of the economy's course are the GDP estimates -- due Friday for the second quarter (with revised estimates in August and September) and on Oct. 26 for the third quarter, from July through September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Picking a partner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney is likely  to announce his running mate sometime during the two weeks after the Olympics end Aug. 12 -- to avoid competing for attention with the Games -- and before the Republican National Convention opens in Tampa on Aug. 27. The process is scrutinized in part as a sign of what kind of decision-maker the presidential candidate would be in office: deliberative or instinctive? Cautious or a risk-taker?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's surprise choice four years ago of then-Alaska governor Sarah Palin, unveiled the day after the Democratic convention ended and three days before the Republican convention opened, underscored his trust-your-gut training as a Navy pilot. Romney's business past shows him as the deliberative sort who carefully would analyze the implications of various choices before acting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many news reports center on Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, an experienced Washington hand from a crucial swing state; former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, a onetime competitor for the nomination who has become a top surrogate; and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The veepstakes has created a cottage industry for lawyers who specialize in vetting contenders, and it is catnip for cable TV commentators. How much it matters to voters isn't clear, however. The last vice presidential pick who clearly made a difference in an election was then-senator Lyndon Johnson, whose presence on the Democratic ticket was decisive in carrying his native Texas and putting John F. Kennedy in the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was, of course, more than a half-century ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big speech</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than vice presidential picks, more than candidate debates, what matters in the campaign's final 100 days are their convention speeches, Christopher Wlezien of Temple University has concluded. He studied the issue for his forthcoming book, The Timeline of Presidential Elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with the advent of the Internet and the saturation of social media, some voters don't tune in to the election until the conventions, Wlezien says. The speeches give them a first look at a challenger who isn't familiar and a second look at a president who is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It gets voters to take stock,&quot; he says. &quot;Do I want to stay the course? Do I want a change?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates' standings after the conventions have proved to be a reasonably reliable indicator of who will win, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney delivers his address Aug. 30 at the Tampa Bay Times Forum in Tampa; Obama, on Sept. 6 at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns describe the moment as pivotal. &quot;They are the biggest speaking platform the candidates are going to have to lay out their arguments,&quot; Axelrod says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gillespie says the speech &quot;sets the frame for the campaign's homestretch. And it's a chance for people to see the nominee unfiltered, not in 30-second spots, not in characterizations or caricatures, but directly, and judge for themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1988, the elder Bush solidified support in a convention speech emphasizing his determination to oppose tax hikes. &quot;Read my lips: No new taxes,&quot; he vowed. That helped him win in 1988, although the fact he broke that  promise as president contributed to his defeat in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it's hard to find examples of vice presidential nominees affecting election outcomes, it's easy to find times when the presidential debates have defined the final weeks of a campaign. &quot;Look, back as far as Kennedy-Nixon the debates have been pretty important,&quot; says Gillespie, a former GOP national chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1960, at the first presidential debate, Richard Nixon's 5 o'clock shadow and sweaty mien contrasted with John Kennedy's ease; JFK won  in November. In 1976,  President  Ford's gaffe (&quot;There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe&quot;) was a distraction in the  final days; he lost  to Jimmy Carter. Ronald Reagan's confident debate demeanor in 1980 won over some voters, and his closing pitch -- &quot;Are you better off than you were four years ago?&quot; --  became a campaign mantra. He won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preparations already have begun in both campaigns for the debates. Obama has drafted Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry to play the role of Romney in his practice sessions. Four years ago, Portman was John McCain's foil in preparations for  debates with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission on Presidential Debates announced Wednesday that the first debate, in Denver, would focus on domestic policy. The second, in Hempstead, N.Y., will have a town-hall format. The third, in Boca Raton, Fla., will be on foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those undecided voters typically wait until the debates are over to make their final decisions,&quot; says Donna Brazile, campaign manager of Al Gore's 2000 presidential bid. When the debates are over, Axelrod says, &quot;people will make their own judgments.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney launched a concerted push Wednesday to depict President Obama as hostile to small business, using the infamous snippet from one of Obama's speeches now known in political shorthand as &quot;You Didn't Build That.&quot;          The president's campaign countered with a new television ad that said his remarks were flagrantly wrenched out of context. The dispute is the latest example of a campaign plucking lines from an opponent's speech in an effort to support and reinforce a broader, negative narrative that it hopes will resonate with voters. In this case, Republicans contend that the remarks capture Obama's identity as a leader who neither understands nor respects business and instinctively looks to government for solutions.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments came from the tail end of 40-minute campaign speech at a Roanoke fire station on July 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that speech, Obama repeated his opposition to Romney's proposal to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans, saying there are successful people who agree and who want instead to forgo tax breaks and &quot;give something back.&quot; He added that those who succeed in business are aided by personal mentors and government policies that support infrastructure and technology. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help,&quot; Obama said. &quot;There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was referring to the roads and bridges - not businesses - as having been built by government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme is not new.  Democratic Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts triggered a similar controversy last year when she said: &quot;There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own - nobody. You built a factory out there? Good for you. But I want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate.&quot;But coming from a sitting president, the comments were of another magnitude. While taking liberties with the context, the Romney campaign seized on &quot;You Didn't Build That&quot; as a rallying cry Wednesday. It staged two dozen &quot;We Did Build This&quot; rallies, including one in Richmond, where small-business owners joined Gov. Robert F. McDonnell  (R) in assailing the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is wrong,'' said Melissa Ball of Ball Office Products. &quot;Americans do build their own business, and we need a president who believes that as well.&quot; Ball said she wants to invite Obama &quot;to hear about the struggles of real-life business owners.&quot; According to the federal database site USASpending.gov, Ball has received several small federal contracts in the past, and Democrats used information like that to push back hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his new ad Wednesday, Obama, looking directly into the camera, said such Republican assertions were &quot;flat-out wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course Americans build their own businesses. Every day, hardworking people sacrifice to meet a payroll, create jobs and make our economy run,&quot; he said. &quot;And what I said was that we need to stand behind them, as America always has, by investing in education and training, roads and bridges, research and technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has also had his rhetoric yanked out of context. Campaigning in New Hampshire in January, he told the Nashua Chamber of Commerce, &quot;I like being able to fire people who provide services to me.&quot; It was part of a longer answer to a question from the audience about health-care policy - specifically, being able to change insurance companies. Just prior to the &quot;fire&quot; comment, Romney said: &quot;I want individuals to have their own insurance. That means the insurance company will have an incentive to keep you healthy. It also means that if you don't like what they do, you could fire them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, in isolation, ricocheting around the Web, the quote helped opponents reinforce an image of Romney as a remorseless corporate predator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign pointed to a series of initiatives that the administration has pursued to help small business, including tax cuts, improved access to capital and an overhaul of the patent system that officials said accelerates processing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small-business leaders say Obama's record is mixed. Todd McCracken, president of the National Small Business Association, said that for some small firms, the administration has been a boon. For businesses that export, for example, McCracken said that reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank Act will help ensure a level playing field. He also described his 65,000 member companies as being &quot;quite comfortable&quot; with the individual insurance mandate at the heart of the Affordable Care Act. The one-year extension of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts for incomes under $250,000 is also a plus, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCracken said Obama has not been aggressive enough in compelling banks to loosen lending policies. And in many instances, he said, tax relief is secondary to the regulatory burdens that leave many small businesses uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Old Town Manassas, several small-business owners said Obama's comments - if they had heard about them - had not elicited a strong reaction one way or the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I work hard for what I've got, but I've had people along the way help me,&quot; said Matt Brower, owner of Simply Sweet on Main, a new ice cream and coffee shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brower, 32, said that he generally tries to stay out of politics but that the president's comments about small businesses &quot;didn't turn me the wrong way.&quot; He credited the city government for allowing him to sell coffee in the nearby train station during colder months. While he had to sign a contract with the city, officials did not charge him anything to set up or operate his stand - a big help since he just started the business two years ago, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Charles Gilliam opened his restaurant in 1998 in Manassas he was &quot;happy if someone would come in every day.&quot; Now, Okra's, which serves Cajun and Creole fare, is thriving, and Gilliam is looking at opening a second restaurant elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A picture of first lady Michelle Obama is in the foyer, and Gilliam proudly points to the spot where she and her children came in for a bite one day a couple of years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was exciting to know the highest office in the country knows about what we do,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his business, Gilliam said, he &quot;hasn't asked for help from government.&quot; If help was offered, &quot;we wouldn't take it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, city officials have made the sidewalks broader on Battle Street, where Okra's sits catty-corner. That has allowed restaurants to put in outside patio seating and offer live music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'd still be doing very well&quot; without the local-government-backed sidewalk project, he said. &quot;But we're grateful to have it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             RICHMOND - Dogs and cats have been invited to vote in the swing state of Virginia, and Mitt Romney smells a rat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican's presidential campaign is calling on state officials to launch a criminal investigation into voter registration forms that a District-based nonprofit recently mailed to hundreds of dead Virginians, children, non-citizens, pets and others ineligible to cast ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Voter Participation Center, which tries to get &quot;historically underrepresented groups&quot; such as women and minorities to vote, acknowledged that it had addressed some forms to people and animals with no business going to the polls. The State Board of Elections said &quot;hundreds if not thousands&quot; of applications were sent to ineligible voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center blamed a faulty commercial mailing list and said the errant mailings represent a small fraction of the nearly 200,000 forms it has sent out across the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mailings have revived talk of _blankvoter fraud in Virginia, a crucial swing state where President Obama and Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, are _blankdeadlocked in a recent poll.          &quot;This presents a very significant risk to the proper administration of the upcoming general election,&quot; Kathryn Biber, the campaign's general counsel, wrote in a letter sent Tuesday to Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R) and the State Board of Elections calling for a criminal investigation.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Cuccinelli said Wednesday that any investigation by the office would have to be initiated by a request from the elections board. The board, while sharply critical of the mailings, does not plan to seek an investigation &quot;at this time,&quot; said Chairman Charles E. Judd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board has received more than 750 complaints, mostly from people whose pets or deceased relatives have received solicitations to register to vote, Judd said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center initially responded to complaints with a comical video that shows a dog talking about how unlikely it is that a cat could vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Someone sent the cat a voter registration form,&quot; the dog says. &quot;Cool out, cat. If you even tried to vote, election officials would catch you. You're not eligible, you're not 18, you walk on four feet and you cough up hairballs, which is gross.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections officials were not amused, chastising the center for its &quot;flippant&quot; video in a letter that also said the group violated state law by filling out applications with voters' names. The law requires that the form be filled out by the applicant or by dictation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials at the center have since dropped the lighthearted tone and have stressed that they mailed applications for registering to vote - forms widely available at government offices and online - and not voter ID cards, which can serve as identification at the polls and can be issued only by elections officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have nothing to do with that issue, voter fraud. We send people applications to fill out in the mail,&quot; said Page S. Gardner, the center's president. &quot;It's up to them to fill out the form and obey all the state laws and federal laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for some, the mailings have reignited fears that Virginia is vulnerable to voter fraud, an issue that has been bitterly debated around the country in recent years. Citing concerns about the integrity of elections, Virginia's GOP-controlled _blankGeneral Assembly this year closed a loophole that had allowed voters to cast ballots without showing identification. Democrats charged that the voter ID law, while more moderate than versions Republicans have recently pushed in other states, was intended to make it harder for minorities and other Democratic-leaning groups to vote.State Sen. Thomas A. Garrett Jr. (R), a Louisa County prosecutor who successfully tried two felons who registered to vote in 2009, said one of the two registered with a form mailed to her by the Voter Participation Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly, they haven't gotten the message,&quot; Garrett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her letter, Biber contends that the center's mass mailing may have violated state laws, including those that prohibit falsifying a registration application and communicating false information to voters about their registration status. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gardner said the group tries to make its mailing list &quot;as perfect as possible.&quot; Dead people can wind up on a mailing list because it is compiled from things such as magazine subscriptions, which often are not updated with a new name when a spouse dies. Some people have subscriptions in the names of their pets for reasons that Gardner, who described herself as &quot;a non-pet owner,&quot; said she did not understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is very sloppy prospect mailing going on,&quot; Judd said. He said he was particularly concerned that the mailings told recipients that &quot;records show that you are eligible to vote in the 2012 presidential election.&quot; That wording makes it sound as if the center is an official government elections entity, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus on the errant mailings is a &quot;man-bites-dog story&quot; in Gardner's view, one that she said misses the bigger picture - that nearly 2 million eligible Virginians are not registered to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's fun to write about Mozart and other pets getting these voter registration applications,&quot; Gardner said, referring to a dead dog who was sent a form from her group. &quot;[But] at some point, we have to look at ourselves and say, 'Really, what's the story here?' &quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats better beware the Republican National Committee's more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger attack ad against the president. Every time I see it, I feel uneasy: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama came to the White House with big plans. He'd halve the deficit. Strengthen the economy. Lower unemployment. What did we get? National debt over 15 trillion and climbing. Unemployment above 8 percent for 40 straight months. An ongoing economic crisis with no end in sight. He tried. You tried. It's okay to make a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point about all that stuff the president promised and didn't do isn't what bothers me. Obama did make big plans. But inheriting a free-falling economy followed by a stubborn recovery, coupled with congressional Republican recalcitrance, have made achieving many of those goals impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, what bothers me are the narrator's last lines, spoken as we see a black-and-white  image of a downward-looking Obama: &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">He tried. You tried. It's okay to make a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millions of Americans were swept up in the drama of the 2008 election. They were proud to cast a ballot that helped elect the first African American president of the United States. Many of those same people have soured on Obama because of what they believe he hasn't been able to achieve. Yet people are conflicted. Poll after poll shows that while Obama gets low marks for his fiscal stewardship, people like him personally, much more so than Romney. The Wall Street Journal-NBC News survey puts Obama's favorable-unfavorable at 49 percent-43 percent and Romney's at 35-49.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the RNC is telling potential voters that it's okay to like the guy personally but not vote for him again. This is not a popularity contest. You gave him a shot. He gave it his best shot. He failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout Obama's presidency, folks have complained that they are branded racist if they disagree with anything the president says or does. Some ardent Obama supporters do exactly that. I have seen instances of this online, on television and in print.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why this ad is the most dangerous for Obama's reelection efforts. It gives those few, yet crucial, undecided voters the pass they might be looking for to vote against Obama. His campaign needs to counter this message as aggressively as the RNC is pushing it. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney launched a concerted push Wednesday to depict President Obama as hostile to small business, using the infamous snippet from one of Obama's speeches now known in political shorthand as &quot;You Didn't Build That.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's campaign countered with a new television ad that said his remarks were flagrantly wrenched out of context. The dispute is the latest example of a campaign plucking lines from an opponent's speech in an effort to support and reinforce a broader, negative narrative that it hopes will resonate with voters. In this case, Republicans contend that the remarks capture Obama's identity as a leader who neither understands nor respects business and instinctively looks to government for solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments came from the tail end of 40-minute campaign speech at a Roanoke fire station on July 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that speech, Obama repeated his opposition to Romney's proposal to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans, saying there are successful people who agree and who want instead to forgo tax breaks and &quot;give something back.&quot; He added that those who succeed in business are aided by personal mentors and government policies that support infrastructure and technology. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help,&quot; Obama said. &quot;There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was referring to the roads and bridges - not businesses - as having been built by government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme is not new.  Democratic Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren of Massachusettstriggered a similar controversy last year when she said: &quot;There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own - nobody. You built a factory out there? Good for you. But I want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But coming from a sitting president, the comments were of another magnitude. While taking liberties with the context, the Romney campaign seized on &quot;You Didn't Build That&quot; as a rallying cry Wednesday. It staged two dozen &quot;We Did Build This&quot; rallies, including one in Richmond, where small-business owners joined Gov. Robert F. McDonnell  (R) in assailing the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is wrong,'' said Melissa Ball of Ball Office Products. &quot;Americans do build their own business, and we need a president who believes that as well.&quot; Ball said she wants to invite Obama &quot;to hear about the struggles of real-life business owners.&quot; According to the federal database site USASpending.gov, Ball has received several small federal contracts in the past, and Democrats used information like that to push back hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his new ad Wednesday, Obama, looking directly into the camera, said such Republican assertions were &quot;flat-out wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course Americans build their own businesses. Every day, hardworking people sacrifice to meet a payroll, create jobs and make our economy run,&quot; he said. &quot;And what I said was that we need to stand behind them, as America always has, by investing in education and training, roads and bridges, research and technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has also had his rhetoric yanked out of context. Campaigning in New Hampshire in January, he told the Nashua Chamber of Commerce, &quot;I like being able to fire people who provide services to me.&quot; It was part of a longer answer to a question from the audience about health-care policy - specifically, being able to change insurance companies. Just prior to the &quot;fire&quot; comment, Romney said: &quot;I want individuals to have their own insurance. That means the insurance company will have an incentive to keep you healthy. It also means that if you don't like what they do, you could fire them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, in isolation, ricocheting around the Web, the quote helped opponents reinforce an image of Romney as a remorseless corporate predator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign pointed to a series of initiatives that the administration has pursued to help small business, including tax cuts, improved access to capital and an overhaul of the patent system that officials said accelerates processing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small-business leaders say Obama's record is mixed. Todd McCracken, president of the National Small Business Association, said that for some small firms, the administration has been a boon. For businesses that export, for example, McCracken said that reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank Act will help ensure a level playing field. He also described his 65,000 member companies as being &quot;quite comfortable&quot; with the individual insurance mandate at the heart of the Affordable Care Act. The one-year extension of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts for incomes under $250,000 is also a plus, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCracken said Obama has not been aggressive enough in compelling banks to loosen lending policies. And in many instances, he said, tax relief is secondary to the regulatory burdens that leave many small businesses uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Old Town Manassas, several small-business owners said Obama's comments - if they had heard about them - had not elicited a strong reaction one way or the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I work hard for what I've got, but I've had people along the way help me,&quot; said Matt Brower, owner of Simply Sweet on Main, a new ice cream and coffee shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brower, 32, said that he generally tries to stay out of politics but that the president's comments about small businesses &quot;didn't turn me the wrong way.&quot; He credited the city government for allowing him to sell coffee in the nearby train station during colder months. While he had to sign a contract with the city, officials did not charge him anything to set up or operate his stand - a big help since he just started the business two years ago, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Charles Gilliam opened his restaurant in 1998 in Manassas he was &quot;happy if someone would come in every day.&quot; Now, Okra's, which serves Cajun and Creole fare, is thriving, and Gilliam is looking at opening a second restaurant elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A picture of first lady Michelle Obama is in the foyer, and Gilliam proudly points to the spot where she and her children came in for a bite one day a couple of years ago.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RICHMOND - Dogs and cats have been invited to vote in the swing state of Virginia, and Mitt Romney smells a rat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican's presidential campaign is calling on state officials to launch a criminal investigation into voter registration forms that a District-based nonprofit recently mailed to hundreds of dead Virginians, children, non-citizens, pets and others ineligible to cast ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Voter Participation Center, which tries to get &quot;historically underrepresented groups&quot; such as women and minorities to vote, acknowledged that it had addressed some forms to people and animals with no business going to the polls. The State Board of Elections said &quot;hundreds if not thousands&quot; of applications were sent to ineligible voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center blamed a faulty commercial mailing list and said the errant mailings represent a small fraction of the nearly 200,000 forms it has sent out across the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mailings have revived talk of _blankvoter fraud in Virginia, a crucial swing state where President Obama and Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, are _blankdeadlocked in a recent poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This presents a very significant risk to the proper administration of the upcoming general election,&quot; Kathryn Biber, the campaign's general counsel, wrote in a letter sent Tuesday to Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R) and the State Board of Elections calling for a criminal investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Cuccinelli said Wednesday that any investigation by the office would have to be initiated by a request from the elections board. The board, while sharply critical of the mailings, does not plan to seek an investigation &quot;at this time,&quot; said Chairman Charles E. Judd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board has received more than 750 complaints, mostly from people whose pets or deceased relatives have received solicitations to register to vote, Judd said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center initially responded to complaints with a comical video that shows a dog talking about how unlikely it is that a cat could vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Someone sent the cat a voter registration form,&quot; the dog says. &quot;Cool out, cat. If you even tried to vote, election officials would catch you. You're not eligible, you're not 18, you walk on four feet and you cough up hairballs, which is gross.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections officials were not amused, chastising the center for its &quot;flippant&quot; video in a letter that also said the group violated state law by filling out applications with voters' names. The law requires that the form be filled out by the applicant or by dictation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials at the center have since dropped the lighthearted tone and have stressed that they mailed applications for registering to vote - forms widely available at government offices and online - and not voter ID cards, which can serve as identification at the polls and can be issued only by elections officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have nothing to do with that issue, voter fraud. We send people applications to fill out in the mail,&quot; said Page S. Gardner, the center's president. &quot;It's up to them to fill out the form and obey all the state laws and federal laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for some, the mailings have reignited fears that Virginia is vulnerable to voter fraud, an issue that has been bitterly debated around the country in recent years. Citing concerns about the integrity of elections, Virginia's GOP-controlled _blankGeneral Assembly this year closed a loophole that had allowed voters to cast ballots without showing identification. Democrats charged that the voter ID law, while more moderate than versions Republicans have recently pushed in other states, was intended to make it harder for minorities and other Democratic-leaning groups to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Thomas A. Garrett Jr. (R), a Louisa County prosecutor who successfully tried two felons who registered to vote in 2009, said one of the two registered with a form mailed to her by the Voter Participation Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly, they haven't gotten the message,&quot; Garrett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her letter, Biber contends that the center's mass mailing may have violated state laws, including those that prohibit falsifying a registration application and communicating false information to voters about their registration status. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gardner said the group tries to make its mailing list &quot;as perfect as possible.&quot; Dead people can wind up on a mailing list because it is compiled from things such as magazine subscriptions, which often are not updated with a new name when a spouse dies. Some people have subscriptions in the names of their pets for reasons that Gardner, who described herself as &quot;a non-pet owner,&quot; said she did not understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is very sloppy prospect mailing going on,&quot; Judd said. He said he was particularly concerned that the mailings told recipients that &quot;records show that you are eligible to vote in the 2012 presidential election.&quot; That wording makes it sound as if the center is an official government elections entity, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus on the errant mailings is a &quot;man-bites-dog story&quot; in Gardner's view, one that she said misses the bigger picture - that nearly 2 million eligible Virginians are not registered to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's fun to write about Mozart and other pets getting these voter registration applications,&quot; Gardner said, referring to a dead dog who was sent a form from her group. &quot;[But] at some point, we have to look at ourselves and say, 'Really, what's the story here?' &quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Worries over making a change</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats better beware the Republican National Committee's more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger attack ad against the president. Every time I see it, I feel uneasy: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama came to the White House with big plans. He'd halve the deficit. Strengthen the economy. Lower unemployment. What did we get? National debt over 15 trillion and climbing. Unemployment above 8 percent for 40 straight months. An ongoing economic crisis with no end in sight. He tried. You tried. It's okay to make a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point about all that stuff the president promised and didn't do isn't what bothers me. Obama did make big plans. But inheriting a free-falling economy followed by a stubborn recovery, coupled with congressional Republican recalcitrance, have made achieving many of those goals impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, what bothers me are the narrator's last lines, spoken as we see a black-and-white  image of a downward-looking Obama: &quot;He tried. You tried. It's okay to make a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millions of Americans were swept up in the drama of the 2008 election. They were proud to cast a ballot that helped elect the first African American president of the United States. Many of those same people have soured on Obama because of what they believe he hasn't been able to achieve. Yet people are conflicted. Poll after poll shows that while Obama gets low marks for his fiscal stewardship, people like him personally, much more so than Romney. The Wall Street Journal-NBC News survey puts Obama's favorable-unfavorable at 49 percent-43 percent and Romney's at 35-49.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the RNC is telling potential voters that it's okay to like the guy personally but not vote for him again. This is not a popularity contest. You gave him a shot. He gave it his best shot. He failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout Obama's presidency, folks have complained that they are branded racist if they disagree with anything the president says or does. Some ardent Obama supporters do exactly that. I have seen instances of this online, on television and in print.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why this ad is the most dangerous for Obama's reelection efforts. It gives those few, yet crucial, undecided voters the pass they might be looking for to vote against Obama. His campaign needs to counter this message as aggressively as the RNC is pushing it. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Obama sat down to record his latest campaign ads, he didn't have far to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twoads released in the last two days were filmed just a few feet from the Oval Office in the West Wing workplace of his chief of staff, an unusual -- but not unprecedented -- use of the official space of the White House for campaign purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking directly to the camera in one ad, Mr. Obama urges voters to see the election as a big choice between competing visions for the country. The backdrop? The floral couch, rust-colored pillows and white mantel in the room that currently serves as Jack Lew's office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another ad, Mr. Obama accuses Mr. Romney of twisting his words about small businesses. That ad was filmed in the same office, in front of Mr. Lew's conference table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What benefit Mr. Obama's campaign team saw in the backdrops is unclear. To the untrained eye, the president might just as easily have been sitting in a nicely appointed room in a fancy hotel. The campaign referred calls to the White House. White House officials insist there is absolutely nothing illegal or improper about it. They point to numerous campaignads that show George W. Bush walking along the White House Colonnade and ads for Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan that show them working in the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reagan, in particular, filmed a four-minute ad from his desk in the Oval Office, speaking directly about the choice before voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A White House spokesman was immediately ready with the video clips and citations that show Mr. Bush's campaign once used a still image of the Republican president standing in the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, said the filming of Mr. Obama's campaign commercials was ''no different than the multitude of examples of past presidents of both parties spanning the last four decades.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others say Mr. Obama's&nbsp;ad pushes somewhat beyond the generic shots and B-roll of a president at work by briefly turning a West Wing office into an advertising studio for his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What a White House has to be careful of is that they don't too easily use the tools around them in a way that would be inappropriate,'' said Matt Schlapp, who served as Mr. Bush's political director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several former Bush officials, including Mr. Schlapp, said they recalled Mr. Bush being filmed walking along the Colonnade alongside the Rose Garden, including some of him walking side-by-side with favored Republican lawmakers. But Mr. Schlapp, now a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama's&nbsp;ad is different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Presidents are careful. There are these conversations about where the lines are,'' Mr. Schlapp said. ''The perception could be to the voter that President Obama is more focused on his re-election instead of getting the job done.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard W. Painter, who was the chief ethics officer in the Bush White House and now teaches at the University of Minnesota law school said that ''filming a political commercial in the chief of staff's office would imply official endorsement, and I would probably say no.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he added that it would not be illegal, and that he would not have made a big case of it. ''So long as it does not involve fund-raising I wouldn't strenuously object,'' he said. ''I would not describe it as highly improper.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sara Fagen, who also served as political director for Mr. Bush, was more charitable, calling the filming of the ad ''an issue that won't matter at all. This will not change one vote.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There are a lot of things to criticize the president about,'' Ms. Fagen said. ''I don't think this is one of them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of the White House has long been a fraught area for presidents. It is both their home and their place of business, and they are inherently political candidates even as they are public servants. The lines have not always been clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. Carter held a luncheon for contributors in the Family Dining Room of the White House in 1978, the Justice Department issued an opinion making a distinction between the White House residence and the West Wing, essentially ruling that a president was entitled to use his home for political purposes. The opinion dealt specifically with fund-raising under the terms of a 19th century law intended to protect federal workers from solicitation in the workplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore ran into harsh criticism and a Justice Department review for their fund-raising activities from the White House before the 1996 election. Mr. Clinton hosted donors for coffees and Lincoln Bedroom overnights in the residence, while Mr. Gore made fund-raising calls from his White House office. Mr. Gore famously defended himself by saying there was ''no controlling legal authority.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department opinion on White House activities focused on fund-raising and did not extend to other political activity like advertising. But presidents have often, though not always, followed the same practice by holding purely political activities like campaign strategy meetings in the residence. Mr. Obama has been attending campaign briefings on Sunday nights in the Roosevelt Room of the West Wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some critics took note of a recent report that Mr. Obama convened from Air Force One a conference call with supporters about fund-raising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'd take a grass-roots check every time,'' he told the supporters, according to one who later wrote about it on The Huffington Post. ''Whatever you can do will be helpful. I have confidence that the number of people who can beat gazillionaires every single time.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Painter said that a general strategy call from Air Force One would not be as objectionable as one explicitly requesting money. ''I don't think an ask call should be made from Air Force One,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign has also recently added a campaign spokeswoman to the gaggle of aides that routinely travel on Air Force One with the president when he takes campaign trips. While on Air Force One on several recent trips, Jen Psaki, the spokeswoman, has used a laptop to show campaign ads to the reporters along on the trips.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- A Republican group backed by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson is starting a new effort in battleground states to win over Jewish voters who could be persuaded to turn away from President Obama and support Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, the Republican Jewish Coalition, plans to begin a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign in the coming weeks called ''My Buyer's Remorse,'' targeting voters in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, aides said. The campaign uses testimonials from people who say they regret supporting Mr. Obama because of his economic policies and his posture toward Israel, in hopes of cutting into the wide advantage Democrats have held over Republicans among Jewish voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the latest foray into the election by Mr. Adelson, a staunch supporter of Israel who has vowed to spend as much as $100 million to defeat Mr. Obama. It marks an escalation of the partisan politics over Middle East policy and represents an emerging Republican strategy of highlighting voters who supported Mr. Obama four years ago but are now expressing disappointment, while signaling to others that they are not alone in shifting their allegiances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Adelson and other members of the group's board have pledged at least $6.5 million to build a comprehensive list of Jewish voters and to wage a word-of-mouth campaign, amplified through social media and television advertising. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intensified pursuit of Jewish voters is coming into sharper view as Mr. Romney leaves on a trip that will take him to Israel this weekend. It is a closely watched visit, especially given the often-tense relations between Mr. Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has known Mr. Romney for three decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Adelson has emerged as potentially the largest single donor in American politics this year. After initially backing Newt Gingrich in the Republican primary race, Mr. Adelson eased his skepticism of Mr. Romney, and his support has steadily grown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, Mr. Adelson and Mr. Romney held a private meeting in Las Vegas, and aides said the two men have communicated occasionally since then. In June, Mr. Adelson and his wife each gave $5 million to a pro-Romney ''super PAC.'' His support for Israel aligns him with other influential Republican constituencies, including evangelical Christians, who see Mr. Obama as failing to support Israel sufficiently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight for the Jewish vote is more of a hunt-and-peck search for disgruntled voters, considering that Mr. Obama won more than 70 percent of votes among Jews in 2008, according to exit polls. But with an estimated 600,000 Jewish voters in Florida, a critical swing state, Democratic leaders said they were not taking the constituency for granted, and they acknowledged a need to increase enthusiasm among Jews before November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They figure if they shave off a few points here and a few points there in the Jewish population through lying and distortions, they can win,'' said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. ''But they can't dress themselves up to be something appealing to the Jewish community when they aren't.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Jewish Coalition, the party's leading outreach group for Jewish voters, has spent months developing a campaign to find like-minded voters in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, the three swing states with the largest Jewish populations. It is the most extensive electoral effort undertaken by the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We don't need to get a majority of the vote to win,'' said Matt Brooks, executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition. ''When we take votes away from Democrats, we are taking votes from a key part of their constituency.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Gallup poll of voters from June 1 to July 22 showed that Mr. Obama held a lead over Mr. Romney among Jewish voters of 67 percent to 25 percent. They said they strongly supported liberal issues that traditionally align with Democrats, including abortion rights, same-sex marriage and an overhaul of immigration laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Mr. Romney won 25 percent of the Jewish vote, it would be the best showing by a Republican candidate in more than two decades, which could be especially important in swing states, where the margin of victory could be narrow. Four years ago, Senator John McCain won about 21 percent of the Jewish vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertising campaign features a testimonial from Michael Goldstein, 48, a community college administrator from New Jersey, who said he enthusiastically supported Mr. Obama's candidacy but became disillusioned by his administration. A lifelong Democrat, he said he was planning to support Mr. Romney by casting his first vote for a Republican in a presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I was enamored with Obama,'' Mr. Goldstein said in an interview. ''I thought he was sharp, intelligent and brought a new sense of wonder to politics. The fact that we were helping elect the first African-American president of the United States made me very proud, but I don't believe anything he says anymore. I go more by his actions than by what he says.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Goldstein said he gradually became disenchanted with Mr. Obama when his promises to change Washington did not come to pass. He said he was particularly incensed by the administration's stance toward Israel, particularly the president's view that the 1967 borders should be a starting point for negotiations for a two-state peace solution. He said he also believed that Mr. Obama showed disrespect to Mr. Netanyahu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains an open question how many voters share the views of Mr. Goldstein, who conceded that some of his frustrations at Mr. Obama were also a result of what he saw as the president's failure to uphold liberal principles on gun control and some social issues. But he said that his discontent was strong enough that he would cast a vote for Mr. Romney and that he intended to campaign aggressively in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It doesn't take a lot of buyer's remorse to potentially shift the outcome,'' said Ari Fleischer, a member of the Republican Jewish Coalition's board and a former press secretary to President George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Obama campaign and the Democratic Party have increased their outreach, leaders of several Jewish organizations dismissed the possibility that the Republicans could make significant inroads in the November election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is a very large chunk of the Jewish community that is very Democratic that can't be eaten into,'' said Mik Moore, founder of the Jewish Council for Education and Research. ''There is a fight for maybe 10-15 percent, but nobody is underestimating the impact that the massive independent spending can have on the campaign.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, a Jewish lobbying group in Washington that favors Democratic candidates, said the effort by Mr. Adelson and the Republican Jewish Coalition would fall short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Every single number indicates there is simply no such thing as a Jewish problem for the president,'' Mr. Ben-Ami said. ''The people who vote only on Israel didn't vote for Obama last time and know who they are voting for already.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;As Mitt Romney heads to London for the Olympics, a sarcastic ad uses the image of Mr. Romney at the 2002 Olympics to underscore attacks about outsourcing and offshore bank accounts. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Mitt Romney will attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London, a moment his campaign hopes will rekindle the warm and fuzzy feelings surrounding his leadership of the Salt Lake City Games a decade ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's allies are hoping for something else altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priorities USA Action, the &quot;super PAC&quot; run by Mr. Obama's former aides, will begin airing a sarcastic ad on Wednesday using the image of Mr. Romney at the 2002 Olympics to underscore attacks about outsourcing and offshore bank accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad -- which will run in Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia - shows Mr. Romney waving to the athletes from China, India, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Burma and Switzerland as an Olympic-sounding announcer lists the Democratic attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know the Swiss have a special place in Mitt Romney's wallet, er, heart,&quot; the announcer says as the Swiss athletes march into the games with Mr. Romney waving. &quot;He kept millions in Swiss banks. Those Swiss sure know how to keep a secret.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Priorities ad ends with the announcer saying: &quot;You gotta say this about Mitt Romney. He sure knows how to go for the gold - for himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biting nature of the ad is a reminder for the Republican campaign that the president and Democrats are not about to stand by while Mr. Romney uses his Olympic narrative to make political gains in the presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That story has been part of Mr. Romney's appeal for years. He wrote one book, called &quot;Turnaround: Crisis, Leadership, and the Olympic Games,&quot; about how he helped rescue the financially troubled and scandal-ridden winter Games. He argued that his decision to leave Massachusetts was motivated by pure idealism, not political ambition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was not coming to Salt Lake City to build infrastructure for Utah or to stimulate economic development,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I was coming for a higher purpose-to restore reputation, to acquit the duties of the United States toward the world, and to restore the Games for the benefit of the athletes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the book, Mr. Romney describes in detail how he was wooed to become C.E.O. of the games, and how he worked to close its budget and credibility gap. That story dovetails well with the case he is making now to lead the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his association with the Olympics also has some potential downsides. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As seized on by Priorities USA Action, the Games have an international focus that provides Mr. Romney's rivals with an opportunity for tweaking at a time when many Americans are looking inward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there's the attack on Mr. Romney's wealth. Mr. Obama's team has been relentlessly painting the Republican candidate as a rich politician who is out of touch with the concerns of average Americans at a time of financial struggles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that context, Mr. Romney is scheduled to attend the Olympic dressage competition, where his wife's horse, Rafalca, is performing the sport of horse ballet. Not exactly the everyman event of the Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. Obama's team has spent weeks questioning Mr. Romney's role at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded, during his Olympic tenure. The primary goal of the attacks was to link him to companies that shipped jobs overseas during that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it also had the goal of tarnishing a bit his decision to leave Bain for the Olympics. David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser for Mr. Obama, piled on this week by tweeting that some of the archival documents about Mr. Romney's tenure at the Olympics remain secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tax returns. Bundlers. Bain. MA records &amp; now key docs from Olympics,&quot; Mr. Axelrod tweeted. &quot;When it comes to secrecy, Mitt takes the gold!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Axelrod was referring to an ABC News report suggesting that some of the records from that time are not likely to be made public, and some may even have been destroyed. A campaign spokeswoman told the network that Mr. Romney was not involved in any decisions about those records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney is unlikely to shy away from using his Olympic story over the course of the next several months. His decision to attend the Olympics during his overseas trip this week suggests that the campaign thinks the political benefits outweigh any possible risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But once the current games are over in a few weeks, expect the Democrats to do what they can to make sure the presidential torch doesn't get passed to Mr. Romney in November.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mitt Romney may be in London, but his backers keep pressing the case back home that President Obama is antibusiness. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on Day 13 of the &quot;you didn't build that&quot; spat, Mitt Romney's campaign planned 24 events in a dozen states on Wednesday to keep the heat on President Obama over his remarks about who deserves credit for business success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as Mr. Romney landed in London to attend the Olympics and begin a foreign trip, his campaign showed no signs of dropping an issue that it believes sheds damaging light on Mr. Obama's attitudes toward free enterprise and his embrace of government's role in the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the Obama campaign responded directly, releasing an ad in which the president says, &quot;Those ads taking my words about small business out of context - they're flat-out wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the nearly two weeks since Mr. Obama's much-parsed remarks about infrastructure and small business, the Romney campaign has focused a series of attacks on what it calls the president's antibusiness attitudes, staging campaign stops where Mr. Romney was flanked by entrepreneurs testifying that their success was due to the sweat of their own brows. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stagecraft is powerful. It has continued despite news reports that some of the business owners got government help along the way -- and despite fact-checker columns pointing out how the Romney campaign has twisted the president's words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Romney&nbsp;ad last week featured Jack Gilchrist, the owner of Gilchrist Metal Fabricating in Hudson, N.H., who asked dubiously, &quot;My hands didn't build this company?'' He went on to accuse the president of &quot;demonizing&quot; entrepreneurs. On Monday, the New Hampshire Union Leader reportedthat Gilchrist Metal received a Small Business Administration loan and benefited from a state tax-exempt bond to open a plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The owner of a Boston bus repair shop stood beside Mr. Romney last week and said, &quot;We don't need any more of government's help.'' The Boston Globe reported that in its first year, the business received a $560,000 federal contract to overhaul 10 buses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on July 13 at a firehouse in Virginia, Mr. Obama made a case that high-income individuals should pay more in taxes to support government services that benefit all. &quot;If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help,'' the president said, adding that government investment in roads, education - even the Internet - helps cultivate the business success of individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign believes it has the grist for drawing a large philosophical difference with Mr. Obama over free enterprise. It announced rallies for Wednesday with small-business owners in 12 swing states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia, Ohio, Iowa, Florida, Missouri, North Carolina, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the nuances of Mr. Obama's original message, his line - &quot;If you've got a business -- you didn't build that; somebody else made that happen'' - has become a fulcrum for Mr. Romney to attack him as out of touch about how business works and how jobs are created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign seems poised to repeat the theme deep into the election season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. Obama seems to recognize the danger, as evidenced by his new ad, in which he looks directly into the camera and says, &quot;Of course Americans build their own businesses.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every day, hard-working people sacrifice to meet a payroll, create jobs and make our economy run,&quot; the president adds.&nbsp; &quot;And what I said was that we need to stand behind them, as America always has, by investing in education and training, roads and bridges, research and technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brad Woodhouse, the communications director for the Democratic National Committee, called the Romney charges about the president's small-business speech &quot;trumped-up, out-of-context, fact-checked-to-death'' misrepresentations, according to a memo obtained by BuzzFeed. He promised that rebuttal events would be staged shortly around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expect a Day 14 and many more on this issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The star of a Romney commercial attacking President Obama actually benefited from several government programs. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has taken a lot of heat from the Romney campaign and its conservative allies for his &quot;If you've got a business - you didn't build that&quot; comment two weeks ago in Roanoke, Va. The presumptive Republican nominee cut a commercial in which a New Hampshire small-business owner took exception to the president's words. &quot;My father's hands didn't build this company? My hands didn't build this company?&quot; Jack Gilchrist, owner of Gilchrist Metal Fabricating Company, asks resentfully. &quot;Through hard work and a little bit of luck, we built this business. Why are you demonizing us for it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now comes reporting from the field that makes Mr. Gilchrist's indignation about Mr. Obama's remarks seem a bit hypocritical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama was not suggesting that people like the Gilchrists did not create their businesses, only that they had some help in the effort. Here is exactly what he said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business - you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can watch the entire speech here or read it here and judge for yourself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on the Romney&nbsp;commercial, it might sound as if Mr. Gilchrist is one of those Ayn Rand-styled individualists who don't actually need all of the things that many others rely on government for. Except that it turns out he's not. On Monday, The New Hampshire Union-Leader reported that Mr. Gilchrist had received a lot of government help over the years: $800,000 in tax-exempt bonds from the state of New Hampshire, a nearly $500,000 loan guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, federally financed trade adjustment assistance and even nearly $90,000 in military contracts since 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federally financed tax-exempt bonds most likely provided Mr. Gilchrist's company with a lower interest rate than a loan, and the S.B.A., as Agenda readers know, guarantees loans that banks wouldn't otherwise make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gilchrist told a Union-Leader reporter, John DiStaso, that he didn't believe he'd &quot;compromised anything or misled anybody,&quot; adding:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not going to turn a blind eye because the money came from the government. As far as I'm concerned, I'm getting some of my tax money back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not stupid, I'm not going to say 'no.' Shame on me if I didn't use what's available. As a matter of fact, right now, I'm driving on a road.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks appear to have put the president on the defensive. On Tuesday, the Obama campaign released its own 30-second spot in which the president speaks directly to the camera, insisting that &quot;of course Americans build their own business.&quot; It was an unusual move, &quot;as surprising as it is significant,&quot; wrote the political commentator Mark Halperin. &quot;A campaign never wants to let the opposition dictate what it advertises on.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney took aim Tuesday at President Obama for failing to prevent leaks of classified information from his administration and prepared for his first overseas trip of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his remarks to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Reno, Romney cast Obama as jeopardizing U.S. standing in the world and making security decisions for  political advantage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presumptive GOP presidential nominee called for a &quot;full and prompt investigation&quot; into leaks of national security information as he seized comments made by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee. He also brought up reports that former Obama Defense secretary Robert Gates was upset by the release of some details of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What kind of White House would reveal classified material for political gain? I'll tell you right now: Mine will not,&quot; Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feinstein, D-Calif., said Monday she doesn't believe that Obama is leaking classified secrets, but &quot;I think the White House has to understand that some of this is coming from their ranks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator said Tuesday she should not have &quot;speculated&quot; on the source of the leaks and criticized Romney for using her comment against the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama  said last month it was &quot;offensive&quot; to suggest that anyone in his administration purposely released classified information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google: Voters moving beyond TV</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google released new data Tuesday suggesting that voters get more and more political information from places other than TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On average, Google found, one-third of people who see a campaign ad on YouTube have not seen it on TV. Sixty-eight percent of voters use the Internet as their primary source of information on political candidates and issues. And 50% of voters say comparing candidates online influences their voting decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statistics come from Google's new &quot;Four Screens to Victory&quot; infographic, which compares television, mobile devices, personal computers and tablets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Access to political information no longer comes from one place -- or one screen,&quot; Google said in a blog post. &quot;The numbers are in, and savvy political campaigns need to take notice.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican-aligned super PACs and other outside conservative groups have spent more than $144 million on general election ads in swing presidential states, a massive outlay of cash that has allowed former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney to exceed early ad spending by President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly 80 percent of ad spending by Republicans on the general election has come from these super PACs, as Romney has expended a relatively meager $35 million on ads in swing states, according to ad buy figures provided to The Fix by a GOP media buyer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, the $20 million Democratic super PACs have spent on ads in the general election accounts for 19 percent of total Democratic ad spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 10 biggest spenders on TV ads among outside groups, eight of them are Republican-affiliated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican outside groups have spent seven times as much as their Democratic counterparts on ads in the general election. In fact, the two-pronged American Crossroads (super PAC) and Crossroads GPS (501c4) have spent in excess of $94 million on TV ads - about five times as much as Democratic super PACs have spent. And that $94 million is roughly two and a half times more than Romney has spent on general election ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken together, the Romney campaign and the panoply of Republican outside groups have spent $179 million on swing-state advertising in the general election; Obama and his outside groups have shelled out $128 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analyzing the spending in a handful of swing states further proves just how critical a role Republican outside money has played in keeping Romney in the game against Obama on the airwaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, outside conservative groups have spent $32 million on ads ($23 million of that is from American Crossroads/Crossroads GPS) while Romney has spent just more than $4 million. Obama's campaign has dumped $20 million on ads in Florida, but Democratic outside groups have spent just $4.6 million. Add it up, and Romney/GOP groups have spent $36 million on ads in the Sunshine State, as compared to $25 million for Obama/Democratic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ditto Ohio, where Republican groups ($22 million) and Romney ($8.8 million) have combined to outspend Obama ($23.6 million) and Democratic groups ($4.5 million). Or Virginia, where GOP groups ($19.9 million) and Romney ($4.8 million) are outspending Obama ($14 million) and Democratic groups ($3.9 million) by a wide margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there are the swing(ish) states where Romney hasn't spent a dime on TV ads, relying solely on GOP super PACs and other groups to combat the Obama offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pennsylvania, Obama has spent $5 million on ads. While Romney hasn't run one ad in the state, GOP outside groups have spent $5 million on ads. (And by the way, this kind of financial matching in the ad wars is not a coincidence.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What these numbers make clear is that Republican super PACs and other outside groups have effectively kept Romney afloat as he recovered - financially and otherwise - from the costly Republican primary season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without the spending by outside GOP groups, Romney would have been swamped on TV in the past few months and we would almost certainly be looking at a very different race 105 days before the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you need evidence about how much super PACs have transformed the 2012 election landscape, you've got it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7:26 p.m. Updated In a new television ad, President Obama speaks directly into the camera to present what he says is a big choice facing voters when they go to the polls in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, which his campaign says will run in nine battleground states, is different in tone from many of the previous commercials from Mr. Obama and his rival, Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than use flashy graphics, ominous-sounding narrators or clever editing, the ad shows Mr. Obama arguing that the election comes down to a choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Not just between two political parties or even two people. It's a choice between two very different plans for our country,'' Mr. Obama says. ''Sometimes politics can seem very small. But the choice you face, it couldn't be bigger.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad comes after weeks in which Mr. Obama's campaign and his Democratic allies have been hammering Mr. Romney's corporate experience and his personal finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial is critical of Mr. Romney's economic approach; the president says it was what ''caused the mess in the first place.'' But the bulk of the ad is a plea for votes on behalf of what Mr. Obama calls his desire to ''create an economy built to last'' by strengthening the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign continued its criticism of the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''President Obama believes that government creates jobs, not hard-working entrepreneurs and small-business owners,'' said Amanda Henneberg, Romney spokeswoman. ''Not only are his 'you didn't build that' comments insulting to job creators, but they also reflect how unqualified he is to lead our country toward an economic recovery. Instead of meeting with his Jobs Council, he is busy holding fund-raisers, playing golf and trying to tear down Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney will never be too busy to focus on jobs and the economy and it will be his top priority as president.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Obama campaign, the new ad will run in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLITICAL campaigns may be able to show specific ads to specific voters online but they may want to tread lightly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results of a new study to be released on Tuesday by professors at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania show that 86 percent of respondents did not want political campaigns to tailor ads to their interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results of the study come at a time when national and local political campaigns are steadily increasing their use of technology that traditional marketers use to tailor advertising. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For political campaigns, the process is called microtargeting. Information about voters -- like the charitable donations they make, the type of credit card they use and the Congressional district they live in -- is combined with voter registration records, and the result allows campaigns to send certain types of messages to voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, one person may see an ad that focuses on a candidate's employment message while another will see an ad about reproductive rights. Both presidential campaigns use some form of microtargeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The overall sense is that there is a real discontent about this,'' said Prof. Joseph Turow of the Annenberg School. ''You have a real disjuncture between the American public and the campaigns that are on a trajectory to increase it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not just discontent with the ads themselves that should concern politicians. Nearly two-thirds of respondents, 64 percent, said the likelihood of their voting for a candidate would decrease if that candidate purchased information about them and their neighbors for the purpose of sending them different messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study was conducted this year by Princeton Survey Research Associates International from April 23 to May 6. It included cellphone and landline telephone interviews in English and Spanish with 1,503 adult Internet users in the continental United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey also examined attitudes toward political advertising on social media sites like Facebook. Seventy percent of respondents said the likelihood of their voting for a candidate they supported would decrease if the campaign used Facebook to send ads to the friends of someone who had ''liked'' a candidate's Facebook page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''People take politics seriously,'' Professor Turow said. ''Even more seriously than advertising, discounts and news.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2009, Professor Turow, with other professors from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California, Berkeley, conducted a study that examined attitudes toward similar types of advertising used by traditional marketers. They found that about two-thirds of respondents objected to having their activities tracked online with the goal of sending them ads tailored to their interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the issue of online tracking in digital advertising has risen to the national stage. Industry groups like the Interactive Advertising Bureau, government agencies including the Federal Trade Commission, the Commerce Department and the White House, and privacy advocates have agreed to work together to satisfy both advertisers and users concerned about Internet privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report on Internet privacy that called on Congress to enact legislation regulating companies known as data brokers, which collect and sell personal information to advertisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission also urged that technology companies offer a ''Do Not Track'' mechanism by the end of the year that would allow users to opt out of having their personal information collected online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Compliance with Do Not Track would be voluntary, so each entity, whether political or commercial, would make its own decision about whether to comply,'' Ed Felten, chief technologist at the commission, said in an e-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A handful of personal interviews conducted with survey respondents showed mixed feelings about tailored political ads, and the collection and use of personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roman Kickirillo, 42, an engineer in Franklin, Tenn., described his attitude toward online advertising of all types as ''total indifference.'' Mr. Kickirillo said he would only be bothered by ads tailored to his specific political interests if the candidate's messages were contradictory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I might never find out that they were saying the opposite because they think that's exactly what I want to hear,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doug Sheaff, 77, a retiree who lives in Bristol, Va., said he would be concerned with how data was collected. ''As long as it's publicly accessible information that they are getting and they are able to tailor the message, I have no problem,'' Mr. Sheaff said. ''The other question is, are they building up a file on me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol Stewart, 49, who lives in New Boston, Tex., and is unemployed after getting ''caught up in the economic crisis,'' said she notices advertising of all types in e-mails, on Web sites and on the right-hand column of Facebook pages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You visit the site and they know everything about you,'' Ms. Stewart said. ''I don't like that.'' Ms. Stewart, who said she considers herself a Democrat, recalls seeing ads online for Mitt Romney but not for Barack Obama but that she has not clicked on the ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When I got the discount card at the grocery store I knew they were going to track my habits,'' Ms. Stewart said. ''But these politicians out here? I didn't agree to let them into my life.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RENO, Nev. -- President Obama directed a sharp assault on Mitt Romney's foreign policy credentials on Monday, as the weekend political truce that followed the shooting rampage in Colorado dissolved into the more familiar political punch and counterpunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech before the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention here, during which he never once mentioned Mr. Romney by name, Mr. Obama nonetheless directly took on the latest salvo from the Romney camp -- Mr. Romney's recent assertion that America under Mr. Obama is in decline. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If anyone tries to tell you our greatness is past, that America is in decline, you tell them this,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Like the 20th century, the 21st century will be another great American century. We are Americans, blessed with the greatest form of government ever devised by man.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Mr. Romney scheduled to speak here on Tuesday and then leave Wednesday on a trip to Britain, Israel and Poland, Mr. Obama used his appearance before the veterans group to paint his rival as a national security neophyte with a dangerous affinity for failed policies of the past. Taking on Mr. Romney's Afghanistan stance, in which he has criticized Mr. Obama for announcing a timetable for withdrawal and said that he would listen to his military commanders before deciding anything, Mr. Obama said: ''When you're commander in chief, you owe the troops a plan. You owe the country a plan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: ''That includes recognizing not just how to begin wars but how to end them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has, for several weeks now, tried to connect Mr. Romney and what it has characterized as a trigger-happy willingness to go to war, a critique that could be damaging if it manages to stick, since Americans have grown war-weary after a decade of combat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''One of the few foreign policy specifics Romney has outlined so far is his opposition to'' the timeline for withdrawal from Afghanistan, said Michelle Flournoy, an Obama campaign national security adviser, during a conference call with reporters to talk about, among other things, Mr. Romney's upcoming meeting in London with Prime Minister David Cameron. ''So the question I have is whether Romney will double down on his opposition to the plan to end the war when he meets with the prime minister later this week.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign fired back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''President Obama thinks visiting our closest ally in the Middle East is a 'distraction,' that Hugo Chavez is not a 'serious' threat, and that the right response to Russia is to promise more 'flexibility' in exchange for giving him 'space' before the election,'' said Mr. Romney's campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul. ''It is clear that President Obama's foreign policy is confused, ineffective and has weakened our influence in every region of the world. Governor Romney understands the difference between our allies and those who will challenge us. He will stand by allies and restore American strength and resolve to protect our interests abroad and defend our values.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama had called a temporary break in campaign hostilities after the Colorado theater shooting last week, and both camps halted their advertising in the state. On Sunday, Mr. Obama flew to Aurora, Colo., and met with families of those killed and with some of the injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign aides also canceled a grass-roots event in Portland, Ore., that was scheduled for Tuesday, saying the ''energy'' at such an event, which was expected to be high-decibel, would be jarring given the events in Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by Monday morning, the Obama campaign had regained its voice. First, it released an ad praising Mr. Obama's ending of the war in Iraq. Then, it held the conference call to discuss Mr. Romney's foreign trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think Mitt Romney owes it to the American people to say where he stands on these important issues as he's trying out to be leader of the free world,'' said Robert Gibbs, the president's former press secretary, before beginning a lengthy discussion about how much more substantive Mr. Obama's 2008 foreign trip was in comparison with Mr. Romney's itinerary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by reporters traveling aboard Air Force One en route to Reno whether the truce was over, Jennifer Psaki, an Obama campaign spokeswoman, noted pointedly: ''You may not have seen because we were taking off, but Mitt Romney did an event that was still going on as we were taking off with some small-business owners where they once again kind of rehashed the false and misleading and out-of-context attacks on the president's record.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was referring to an appearance by Mr. Romney in Costa Mesa, Calif., in which he renewed his argument that the president does not understand how business works. At the event, his campaign unveiled a new slogan -- ''We Did Build It'' -- which they put on a sign to use as a backdrop for a round table, which included three people whose businesses have benefited from government contracts. The appearance was the latest effort by the Republican challenger to capitalize on Mr. Obama's recent comments celebrating not only individual initiative but also societal investments, like public education and government financing of the Internet and transportation infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Reno, Mr. Obama picked up the campaign trail in earnest, heading to Oakland, Calif., for three fund-raisers. On Tuesday, he will be raising money in Portland and Seattle, before heading to New Orleans on Wednesday for fund-raisers there as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;With both camps decrying the focus on &quot;small things,&quot; there's some reason to think that the conversation might be a tad more elevated in the weeks to come - but that doesn't mean it will last. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we entering a new, more grown-up phase of the 2012 presidential campaign? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For weeks, President Obama and Mitt Romney have been trading shrill, &quot;I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I&quot; exchanges that have done little to satisfy anyone looking for a serious policy debate. That pattern may continue through the summer and into the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the massacre in Colorado forced the entire campaign to a much-needed dead-stop for a couple of days. The London Olympics are about to start, giving everyone something else to watch besides attack ads. And Mr. Romney's departure for a week of foreign policy discussions abroad could help mute the summertime squabbling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With both camps decrying the focus on &quot;small things,&quot; there's already some reason to think that the conversation might be a tad more elevated in the weeks to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's advisers have said he plans to avoid unnecessary criticism of the president while on foreign soil. Instead, Mr. Romney has described his six-day trip through England, Israel and Poland as an effort to listen more than talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he sticks to that plan, the week ahead could present both sides an opportunity to discuss thorny national security and foreign policy issues at a time when the stakes couldn't be higher in several regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, back home, Mr. Obama released a television ad on Monday that was striking in its subdued tone and restraint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ad, Mr. Obama looks straight into the camera. Gone are the flashy graphics, ominous-sounding narrators or clever editing meant to make his opponent look bad. Instead, Mr. Obama presents the election as a choice between two visions of how to govern the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not just between two political parties or even two people. It's a choice between two very different plans for our country,&quot; Mr. Obama says. &quot;Sometimes politics can seem very small. But the choice you face, it couldn't be bigger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney has used the &quot;small things&quot; phrase before, too. Citing the president's own speech from the 2008 convention, in which Mr. Obama decried campaigns which become about &quot;small things,&quot; Mr. Romney has chided the president's attacks on his record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But until now, neither side has done much to break the back-and-forth cycle of charge and countercharge.<BR>Historians may look back on the first half of an unusually hot summer as the time when the campaigns descended fully into negativity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But will that change? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigns have been interrupted before by big events, and they usually revert to the status quo within a short time. In 2001, the governor's race in Virginia was literally put on hold for days after the Sept. 11 attacks. But by election day, the two candidates were trading attacks again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of the current presidential campaign, there's evidence to suggest that's what may happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in California on Monday, Mr. Romney continued to pound Mr. Obama for a comment that the president made in a speech last week. Critics of Mr. Romney say he is taking the comment out of context in an effort to claim that the president doesn't understand or appreciate businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see you as the good guys,&quot; Mr. Romney said at a meeting of business owners, implying that Mr. Obama sees them as the bad guys. &quot;If you are employing people and hiring people, I want to see you do better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on the airwaves, Mr. Obama is continuing to run a hard-hitting commercial that uses Mr. Romney singing an off-key rendition of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; as a backdrop to charges that the Republican candidate kept his personal finance in secretive, offshore accounts in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there are the outside groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priorities USA Action, a Democratic &quot;Super PAC&quot; dedicated to re-electing Mr. Obama, has increased its fund-raising recently, suggesting that rich liberals may have finally found their taste for the jugular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the coalition of Republican groups trying to oust Mr. Obama are getting bigger and better funded by the day. They are running ads attacking the president's health care law and his stimulus program - and there's little reason to think they are planning to stop anytime soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, even as Mr. Romney prepared to depart for his trip, his campaign surrogates attacked the president's foreign policy as a failure, focusing on the delicate situation in the Middle East and on Mr. Obama's decision not to make a trip to Israel in his first term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His photo-ops are no substitute for a policy based upon shared values and shared interests - something we haven't seen from Barack Obama,&quot; said Bob McDonnell, the Republican governor of Virginia. &quot;Instead, we've seen his administration pressure Israel at a moment when Israel's security is under the greatest threat since the October War of 1973.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another surrogate, Representative Connie Mack of Florida, in a statement accused Mr. Obama of downplaying the threat from Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, the leader of Venezuela. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He knows that in Barack Obama, he faces an American president who has not blocked his path in any way,&quot; Mr. Mack said of Mr. Ch&aacute;vez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that is the essence of the message that Mr. Romney and his allies spend the next week offering, the tone of the 2012 campaign is likely to remain as it's been all summer long.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few thoughts related to the fake controversy over Obama's &quot;you didn't build that&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, sure enough, the self-reliant businessman featured in Romney's ads was the beneficiary of large government loans and contracts. This doesn't make him a bad guy; pretending that he did it all himself does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as many others have pointed out, what does it say about Romney's campaign that to run against a sitting president, one with a three and a half year track record, they have to lie about what he said to find a point of attack? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a slightly more elevated note, Matt Yglesias has some fun with a prominent libertarian, Peter Thiel, who looks at the contrast between rapid progress in information technology and less rapid progress in &quot;stuff&quot; and blames .. the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a way, I'm reluctant to make too much fun of Thiel because at least he points to something that I notice a lot. If you look at what futurists were predicting 40 or 45 years ago, they somewhat underpredicted progress in IT (except for the artificial intelligence thing), but wildly overpredicted progress in dealing with the material world. Weren't we supposed to have underwater cities, commercial space flight, and flying cars by now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But blaming the government is silly -- not least because, via Mark Thoma, the government created the Internet in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is that technological progress is uneven, for reasons that need have nothing to do with policy: sometimes you strike a rich technological vein that can be mined for decades, like etching circuits using photolithography, sometimes you don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider productivity in two industries, from the BLS:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does anyone think this contrast reflects the heavy hand of government on the grocery store industry -- as opposed to the fact that there just hasn't been a technological breakthrough that lets one guy at the counter serve 10 people at once?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, I still want my flying car before I get too old to drive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Obama sat down to record his latest campaign ads, he didn't have far to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twoads released in the last two days were filmed just a few feet from the Oval Office in the West Wing workplace of his chief of staff, an unusual -- but not unprecedented -- use of the official space of the White House for campaign purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking directly to the camera in one ad, Mr. Obama urges voters to see the election as a big choice between competing visions for the country. The backdrop? The floral couch, rust-colored pillows and white mantel in the room that currently serves as Jack Lew's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another ad, Mr. Obama accuses Mr. Romney of twisting his words about small businesses. That ad was filmed in the same office, in front of Mr. Lew's conference table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What benefit Mr. Obama's campaign team saw in the backdrops is unclear. To the untrained eye, the president might just as easily have been sitting in a nicely appointed room in a fancy hotel. The campaign referred calls to the White House.<BR><BR>White House officials insist there is absolutely nothing illegal or improper about it. They point to numerous campaignads that show George W. Bush walking along the White House Colonnade and ads for Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan that show them working in the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reagan, in particular, filmed a four-minute ad from his desk in the Oval Office, speaking directly about the choice before voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A White House spokesman was immediately ready with the video clips and citations that show Mr. Bush's campaign once used a still image of the Republican president standing in the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, said the filming of Mr. Obama's campaign commercials was &quot;no different than the multitude of examples of past presidents of both parties spanning the last four decades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others say Mr. Obama's&nbsp;ad pushes somewhat beyond the generic shots and B-roll of a president at work by briefly turning a West Wing office into an advertising studio for his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What a White House has to be careful of is that they don't too easily use the tools around them in a way that would be inappropriate,&quot; said Matt Schlapp, who served as Mr. Bush's political director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several former Bush officials, including Mr. Schlapp, said they recalled Mr. Bush being filmed walking along the Colonnade alongside the Rose Garden, including some of him walking side-by-side with favored Republican lawmakers. But Mr. Schlapp, now a Republican strategist, said Mr. Obama's&nbsp;ad is different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presidents are careful. There are these conversations about where the lines are,&quot; Mr. Schlapp said. &quot;The perception could be to the voter that President Obama is more focused on his re-election instead of getting the job done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard W. Painter, who was the chief ethics officer in the Bush White House and now teaches at the University of Minnesota law school said that &quot;filming a political commercial in the chief of staff's office would imply official endorsement, and I would probably say no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he added that it would not be illegal, and that he would not have made a big case of it. &quot;So long as it does not involve fund-raising I wouldn't strenuously object,&quot; he said. &quot;I would not describe it as highly improper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sara Fagen, who also served as political director for Mr. Bush, was more charitable, calling the filming of the ad &quot;an issue that won't matter at all. This will not change one vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a lot of things to criticize the president about,&quot; Ms. Fagen said. &quot;I don't think this is one of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of the White House has long been a fraught area for presidents. It is both their home and their place of business, and they are inherently political candidates even as they are public servants. The lines have not always been clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. Carter held a luncheon for contributors in the Family Dining Room of the White House in 1978, the Justice Department issued an opinion making a distinction between the White House residence and the West Wing, essentially ruling that a president was entitled to use his home for political purposes. The opinion dealt specifically with fund-raising under the terms of a 19th century law intended to protect federal workers from solicitation in the workplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore ran into harsh criticism and a Justice Department review for their fund-raising activities from the White House before the 1996 election. Mr. Clinton hosted donors for coffees and Lincoln Bedroom overnights in the residence, while Mr. Gore made fund-raising calls from his White House office. Mr. Gore famously defended himself by saying there was &quot;no controlling legal authority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department opinion on White House activities focused on fund-raising and did not extend to other political activity like advertising. But presidents have often, though not always, followed the same practice by holding purely political activities like campaign strategy meetings in the residence. Mr. Obama has been attending campaign briefings on Sunday nights in the Roosevelt Room of the West Wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some critics took note of a recent report that Mr. Obama convened from Air Force One a conference call with supporters about fund-raising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd take a grass-roots check every time,&quot; he told the supporters, according to one who later wrote about it on The Huffington Post. &quot;Whatever you can do will be helpful. I have confidence that the number of people who can beat gazillionaires every single time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Painter said that a general strategy call from Air Force One would not be as objectionable as one explicitly requesting money. &quot;I don't think an ask call should be made from Air Force One,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign has also recently added a campaign spokeswoman to the gaggle of aides that routinely travel on Air Force One with the president when he takes campaign trips. While on Air Force One on several recent trips, Jen Psaki, the spokeswoman, has used a laptop to show campaign ads to the reporters along on the trips.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the better part of three days, President Obama and Mitt Romney took a step back from politics out of respect for the victims of Friday's movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By  Monday, the campaigns were back in full swing with  speeches, fundraisers and sharp attacks by campaign surrogates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an address to  the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Obama touted his national security record  and lashed out at GOP lawmakers who agreed last year to dramatic cuts in defense spending if Congress fails  to come up with a deficit-cutting deal by January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of those Republicans have since chafed at the idea, and Romney has called for increasing defense spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now they're trying to wriggle out of what they agreed to do,&quot; Obama charged. &quot;Instead of making tough choices to reduce the deficit, they'd rather protect tax cuts for some of the wealthiest Americans, even if it risks big cuts in our military.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a roundtable  with small-business owners in Costa Mesa, Calif., Romney criticized Obama for failing to meet with the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in more than six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the last six months, he's done 109 fundraisers,&quot; Romney said. &quot;He found time for that. I'd suggest between the fundraisers, get together with the Jobs Council and learn from people who are working hard to create jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee  recruited three small-business owners to  join an afternoon call with reporters to argue the point that Obama wrongly believes government, not small business, is what drives American success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's surrogates used Monday's campaign restart to criticize Romney's qualifications to be commander in chief as the former Massachusetts governor prepared for a trip to England, Israel and Poland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Gibbs, a senior adviser to the Obama campaign, said that when Obama made a foreign trip during the 2008 campaign, he outlined detailed positions on ending the Iraq War and other issues.  Gibbs argued  Romney has offered no specific foreign policy plans. &quot;He's so far talked only in platitudes and criticized the president,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an ad released Monday, the Obama campaign took a step back from  recent hard-hitting attacks  on Romney's personal finances. Instead, addressing the camera directly -- a tactic rarely used by the campaign -- Obama tells voters their choice isn't &quot;between two political parties or even two people,&quot; but between economic visions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes politics can seem very small,&quot; Obama says in the ad, &quot;but the choice you face, it couldn't be bigger.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday morning, the faithful gather to receive the word. Not at church, but in front of the television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sunday morning news shows are such a staple of presidential politics that it's more remarkable when a candidate has not appeared on them than otherwise. Each week, congressional leaders, campaign strategists and administration officials sit down for interviews under the lights of Meet the Press, Face the Nation, This Week, Fox News Sunday and State of the Union. Combined, they're watched by close to 10 million people -- including virtually all the political apparatus of Washington -- in what George Stephanopoulos, the host of ABC's This Week, calls a &quot;civic ritual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ritual is largely unchanged since NBC's Meet the Press, the oldest show, went on the air in 1947. Watch a Meet clip from 1956 of diplomat Claire Booth Luce dodging questions about her political plans and it's not that different from, say, Obama chief of staff Jack Lew refusing to call the health care mandate a tax earlier this month during a grilling by Fox News' Chris Wallace. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has changed is the rest of the political conversation. This year, in what Stephanopoulos dubs &quot;the full Twitter election,&quot; the cascade of instantaneous, incremental news -- driven by Twitter,  news sites such as Politico and the Huffington Post, and the constant churn of communication from political campaigns -- has cast the Sunday shows into the role of quote factories and meme generators, a jumping-off point for a week of political haggling. The Sunday shows provide not the last word in politics but the opening remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They used to be the place where you went to hear very important people discuss very serious issues and be cross-examined by serious journalists. Now that function is something that happens in political discourse in all kinds of ways, especially digital,&quot; says Alex Jones, head of Harvard's Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Virginia political scientist and frequent cable talker Larry Sabato watches the Sunday shows and often tweets about them at the same time. &quot;Those morning chat shows used to dominate the Sunday evening news and the Monday news cycle,&quot; he says. &quot;In this rapidly moving Twitterverse, there are three or four news cycles just on Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, for example, on Meet the Press, Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a Democrat, called Obama's attacks on Bain Capital &quot;nauseating,&quot; a comment out of step with the Democratic line.  Booker's hasty backtracking went out on Twitter two hours later, and his rebuttal video was up on YouTube by dinnertime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 15, amid a   Democratic-fanned controversy over when Mitt Romney left Bain, Romney adviser Ed Gillespie went on two shows to say the Republican nominee had &quot;retired retroactively,&quot; and by noon (as the Obama campaign happily reported), &quot;#retroactively&quot; was the top trend on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're still standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news cycle for all media has been obliterated by the digital revolution: newspapers and magazines no less than broadcast TV, but the Sunday shows are unique for their role in national politics. They provide a predictably timed, deep well of news from the most prominent people in public affairs, a heap of information and commentary that can be sliced and diced by news outlets and by the  campaigns for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snippets of the Sunday shows turn up in campaign ads -- not just the guests but the hosts, as Bob Schieffer discovered when he saw himself in an ad that ran during the Face the Nation broadcast July 15. The hosts are, of course, media stars: Politico runs a weekly feature called &quot;Turn the Tables&quot; interviewing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the networks and cable channels are talking about what got said on Meet the Press and Face the Nation  and all the infinite number of Internet outlets often use these things as a jumping-off point for what they're going to be commenting on,&quot; says Robert Thompson, a TV and popular culture professor at Syracuse University. &quot;These shows are kind of the host organisms for all kinds of parasitic organizations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programs' journalists say social media have enhanced the Sunday shows rather than drowned  them out. Twitter is &quot;more of an adjunct and a booster charge for the shows as much as a competitor,&quot; Stephanopoulos says. &quot;It becomes a way for us to get our news out, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shows set the agenda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President  Biden said on Meet the Press May 6 that he is &quot;comfortable&quot; with same-sex marriage. Biden seemed to have gotten ahead of the president, who had not endorsed the idea. Three days later, he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can look at any traditional or new media you want, that's impact,&quot; host David Gregory says of the Biden interview. &quot;Beyond traditional media impact, there was tremendous social media impact. I don't think one displaces the other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only do the shows have websites, blogs and online-only features, but the hosts (except for Fox's Chris Wallace) all have Twitter accounts. The shows ask for viewer questions via Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus. Face the Nation has held an on-air Google Plus &quot;hangout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social media &quot;allows us to engage much more with viewers and see trends about what people are talking about, what people are interested in. It allows us to have more of a direct dialogue with viewers,&quot; says Betsy Fischer Martin, Meet the Press executive producer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have viewers who are still avid viewers but who want to be able to interact,&quot; host Gregory says. &quot;The change from passivity to interaction is really different. The people we are talking to are talking back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another aspect of the Sunday shows that has changed little since 1947, and is often criticized, is the diversity of guests. There is little: A 2011 study from five Hispanic advocacy groups showed that interview guests on four Sunday shows (CNN was not included) were white (87%) and male (85%). The panelists for roundtable discussions, where the news organizations have greater latitude of choice, were gender-equal, though 83% white, according to the same study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That largely reflects the realities of Washington, says Candy Crowley, host of CNN's State of the Union. &quot;If you want to talk about why decisions are being made and what decisions are being made, you need to talk to the power structure,&quot; which is overwhelmingly white, she says. &quot;Except for the president, and I've asked him constantly about coming on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diversity of viewpoint is also scarce, says media critic Jay Rosen, author of the blog PressThink.  &quot;There hasn't been a new idea imported into Sunday morning television, as far as I can tell, in 25 years,&quot; he says. &quot;They're a good bulletin board for the political class to work out its own interpretation of what's happening. They're a good way to find out what conventional wisdom is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's because, he says, guests spout  talking points without restraint or challenge.  Recently on This Week, for instance, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley used the phrase &quot;Swiss bank account&quot; -- a key Democratic criticism of Mitt Romney -- nine times in less than 15 minutes. Host Terry Moran had to point out he had asked O'Malley about Obama's responsibility for the economy, not to attack Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interviewers say they want to give guests their say, even if it sometimes sounds as if &quot;they were reading from the same piece of paper,&quot; Face the Nation's Schieffer says. &quot;We're not trying to get people to say what they didn't mean to say, we're trying to get people to say exactly what they mean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change looks unlikely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schieffer readily refers to his show as &quot;old-fashioned,&quot; in a good way. &quot;We are still the place where people can come, sit down and say more than the first paragraph of whatever it is they have to say,&quot; he says. Calling the shows too Beltway-focused is &quot;ignoring what the political process is.  What are they proposing as an alternative? That these people not come on television? How else are we supposed to find out what they're all about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of the prevalence of talking points, Sunday shows make news. CBS' Jan Crawford reported on Face the Nation that Chief Justice John Roberts switched sides to uphold the Obama administration's health care overhaul. David Plouffe previewed the Obama campaign's attacks on Mitt Romney last October when he said on Meet the Press that Romney has &quot;no core.&quot; And then there are the perceived gaffes, such as Biden's same-sex marriage comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday guests &quot;make news either because you break new ground on something or you screw up,&quot;  Crowley says.  &quot;Do they make news that's going to last 48 hours? No. Nobody makes news that lasts 48 hours anymore.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                Is Obama spending too much?          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of a report that the Obama campaign's burn rate - the amount of money it is  spending per month on the race - has raised concerns among some within the Democratic Party,  President Obama's campaign manager insisted that every penny is being well spent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We made a big bet in this campaign,&quot; Jim Messina told the Fix in an interview Monday. &quot;Ground organization matters, and building one takes a lot of money. It's an expensive proposition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messina added that the campaign is spending less at this point than President George W. Bush spent at the same time in the 2004 campaign despite building a ground game and &quot;currently fending off six or seven Republican super PACs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama team spent $58 million in June - $38 million of which went to a television ad campaign in a handful of swing states. GOP challenger Mitt Romney doled out $27.5 million in June. That disparity allowed Romney to pass Obama in cash on hand at the end of the month; Romney and the Republican National Committee ended June with $170 million in the bank, compared with $144 million for Obama and the Democratic National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In terms of ad spending, this is the period when voters are learning about Romney's record, and we want to be a part of that conversation,&quot; Messina said. &quot;In the battleground states, as people get to know Romney's record, they like it less and less.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released this month indicated that Romney's image among voters in swing states had taken a hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messina's contention is that &quot;this race at a national level is relatively locked in right now&quot; but that the poll data suggest that the money being spent in swing states to define Romney is paying dividends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More broadly, Messina's self-described &quot;big bet&quot; is that in an election that is expected to be extremely close, being able to identify and turn out Obama supporters is key.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That calculation is similar to how the Bush campaign viewed the 2004 electorate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messina and the rest of the Obama team are trying to replicate that Bush approach while  trying to convince independent/undecided voters through a slew of negative TV ads that Romney isn't the candidate for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's an expensive proposition. We'll know in November whether Messina made the right bet or whether he (and his candidate) went bust.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             RENO, Nev. - President Obama, resuming a three-day swing up the West Coast after pausing to visit victims of the deadly shooting in Colorado, turned on Monday to military families as he announced a new effort to help service members transition back to civilian life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Mitt Romney returned to the campaign trail as well, calling once more for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act at a business roundtable in Costa Mesa - but refraining from harshly criticizing the president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates have ordered a temporary pause in the most aggressive campaigning in Colorado following the shooting, keeping their most critical ads off the airwaves in Aurora, the town where a gunman killed 12 people and wounded 58 at a midnight movie screening early Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the campaigns began to return to normal on Monday. Obama released a new television ad called &quot;The Choice&quot; in which he criticized Romney's plan to cut taxes for the wealthy. His campaign held a conference call with reporters attacking Romney's upcoming trip to Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign as well as the Republican National Committee ripped into Obama's speech in Reno before the 113th national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars - a group that reaches a key voting bloc both campaigns are battling to win in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Transition GPS          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has been courting service members, veterans and their families for months, touting his wind-down of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, better job training and health benefits for veterans and the fact that al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden was killed on his watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He delivered a similar message Monday, but he added one nugget of news by announcing Transition GPS, an effort to improve an existing federal program that helps service members make the transition from military to private-sector life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starting this year, Obama said, the program will do a better job of helping people leaving the armed services gain job training, earn certifications and find jobs. It will be mandatory for all departing service members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you want somebody who gets the job done, then hire a vet,&quot; the president told a large crowd of veterans at Reno-Sparks Convention Center. &quot;Hire a vet, and they will make you proud - just like they've made America proud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney is also seeking support from veteran and military families, significant populations in several key swing states including Virginia and Colorado. The former Massachusetts governor will address the VFW on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm really undecided,&quot; said Chanda Wieland, 42, an Army veteran and registered Republican from Pahrump, Nev., who is listening closely this week to what both candidates have to say about helping veterans. &quot;Obama had a lot of information concerning the veterans. I can't say I really support him or Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Costa Mesa, Romney, who scooped up $10 million in two days of fundraising over the weekend, continued his outreach to business owners and seized on comments the president made about the help government provides to businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who have spent their entire livelihood working in government, they sometimes don't appreciate just how hard it is to start a business, grow a business, maintain a business, so that you can maintain employees and pay them better wages,&quot; Romney said, speaking at Endural, which makes industrial containers. &quot;Either they think business is an enemy or that business is getting a free ride and there's a sense that somehow you're the bad guys. I see you as the good guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On military affairs, Romney has focused on Obama's continuing drawdown in Afghanistan, which he said has been occurring too quickly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has also blamed the president for looming defense cuts that will take effect in January if a budget deal isn't struck with Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama anticipated that argument from his opponent when Romney goes before the VFW on Tuesday, urging the crowd Monday to hold Congress accountable for those looming cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not, however, mention the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy toward gays in the military that he repealed last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Tribute to victims          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president referenced the shooting in Colorado by paying tribute to four service members or veterans who died in that movie theater early Friday: Jesse Childress, 29, an Air Force reservist and cyber specialist, &quot;the kind of guy, said a friend, who would help anybody&quot;; John Larimer, 27, a petty officer 3rd class in the Navy and &quot;an outstanding shipmate&quot;; Rebecca Wingo, 32, an Air Force veteran who was fluent in Chinese and the mother of two little girls; and Jonathan Blunk, 26, from Reno, a veteran of three Navy tours whose family and friends, Obama said, &quot;will always know that in that theater he gave his own life to save another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the president canceled one campaign rally in Portland, Ore., Tuesday, his three-day swing, combining a series of public and private events, will include stops in San Francisco, Oregon, Seattle and New Orleans. In San Francisco alone later Monday, he was expected to raise more than $3 million for the Obama Victory Fund, a joint committee benefiting the Obama reelection campaign, the Democratic National Committee and several state party committees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Is Obama spending too much?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of a report that the Obama campaign's burn rate - the amount of money it is  spending per month on the race - has raised concerns among some within the Democratic Party,  President Obama's campaign manager insisted that every penny is being well spent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We made a big bet in this campaign,&quot; Jim Messina told the Fix in an interview Monday. &quot;Ground organization matters, and building one takes a lot of money. It's an expensive proposition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messina added that the campaign is spending less at this point than President George W. Bush spent at the same time in the 2004 campaign despite building a ground game and &quot;currently fending off six or seven Republican super PACs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama team spent $58 million in June - $38 million of which went to a television ad campaign in a handful of swing states. GOP challenger Mitt Romney doled out $27.5 million in June. That disparity allowed Romney to pass Obama in cash on hand at the end of the month; Romney and the Republican National Committee ended June with $170 million in the bank, compared with $144 million for Obama and the Democratic National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In terms of ad spending, this is the period when voters are learning about Romney's record, and we want to be a part of that conversation,&quot; Messina said. &quot;In the battleground states, as people get to know Romney's record, they like it less and less.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released this month indicated that Romney's image among voters in swing states had taken a hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messina's contention is that &quot;this race at a national level is relatively locked in right now&quot; but that the poll data suggest that the money being spent in swing states to define Romney is paying dividends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More broadly, Messina's self-described &quot;big bet&quot; is that in an election that is expected to be extremely close, being able to identify and turn out Obama supporters is key.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That calculation is similar to how the Bush campaign viewed the 2004 electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messina and the rest of the Obama team are trying to replicate that Bush approach while  trying to convince independent/undecided voters through a slew of negative TV ads that Romney isn't the candidate for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's an expensive proposition. We'll know in November whether Messina made the right bet or whether he (and his candidate) went bust.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In 2004, President Obama famously denounced &quot;spin masters and negative ad peddlers.&quot; Facing a tough re-election bid, has he adopted the strategy he once scorned? <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama first captured the national spotlight with a speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention in Boston in which he called for an end to the politics of division. The audience roared back its applause at the end of almost every line:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America. There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans, Obama declared, are </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America. In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism, or do we participate in a politics of hope?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, faced with a tough re-election fight, President Obama has, in fundamental respects, adopted the strategy he denounced eight years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is running a two-track campaign. One track of his re-election drive seeks to boost turnout among core liberal groups; the other aims to suppress turnout and minimize his margin of defeat in the most hostile segment of the electorate, whites without college degrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This approach assumes a highly polarized electorate and tries to make the best of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his campaign web site, Obama singles out 16 specific target constituencies under &quot;groups.&quot; Some are listed because it would be politically damaging to fail to include them: People of Faith; Veterans and Military Families; Rural Americans; Seniors; and Small Business Owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others make up the heart of the liberal-left coalition: African Americans, Environmentalists, Latinos, Young Americans, LGBT Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, Educators, Jewish Americans, Nurses and Women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is actively courting all of these constituencies: endingthe deportation of many young workers who are in the United States illegally; endorsing same-sex marriage; loosening work requirements for welfare recipients; pressing Congress to keep student loan rates low; rejecting the proposal to build the northern portion of the 1,700 mile Keystone pipeline from Canada to Texas; and promoting health-care reform that requires insurance plans to fully cover birth control without co-pays or deductibles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, the Obama campaign is not spending the lion's share of its money on these groups. Instead, Obama's television ads, at $65.6 million the biggest cost of his re-election bid so far, are overwhelmingly aimed at discrediting Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The negative ads run by the Obama campaign and its allied &quot;super PAC,&quot; Priorities USA - ads demonizing Romney - target not only whites without college degrees, but in particular white men without degrees, a constituency Obama has no hope of winning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two anti-Romney&nbsp;commercials that appear to have resonated most powerfully, according to measures of YouTube views, are explicitly aimed at these voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Priorities USA ad titled &quot;Stage&quot; - with over 1.4 million views - is narrated by Mike Earnest, a middle-aged white working-class man. He describes building a stage at a paper plant in Marion, Ind., that was in operation 24 hours a day. Shortly afterward, workers from all three shifts were called in. &quot;A group of people walked out on that stage and told us that the plant is now closed and all of you are fired,&quot; Earnest says. &quot;Mitt Romney made over $100 million by shutting down our plant and devastated our lives. Turns out when we build that stage it was like building our own coffin, and it just makes me sick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama&nbsp;ad, &quot;Firms&quot; with over 1.9 million views, shows Romney singing &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at The Villages, a Florida retirement community. The screen shifts from Romney to images of shuttered factories and empty office rooms, overlaid with a series of headlines, &quot;In Business, Mitt Romney's Firms Shipped Jobs to Mexico and China,&quot; &quot;He Had Millions in a Swiss Bank Account,&quot; &quot;Tax Havens Like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's current level of support from white men without college degrees is so low that &quot;if sustained through Election Day,&quot; it &quot;would represent a modern nadir for Democrats,&quot; Ron Brownstein pointed out earlier this month in the National Journal. Brownstein cited a Quinnipiac poll showing Romney beating Obama 56-29 and a Washington Post/ABC survey putting the contest at 65 for Romney, 28 for Obama among these voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A central goal of the anti-Romney&nbsp;commercials is to cross-pressure these whites. Persuading more than 28 percent of them to vote for Obama is a tough sell, but the Obama campaign can try to make the alternative, voting for Romney, equally unacceptable. Conflicted voters, especially those holding negative views of both candidates, are likely to skip voting altogether. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, for example, in a tactic designed to decrease black turnout, the Bush campaign sent deeply religious black voters mail and email noting Democratic support for same-sex civil unions, with the goal of creating ambivalence toward Senator John F. Kerry. Over the past two years, Republican-controlled state legislatures have been conducting an aggressive vote-suppression strategy of their own through the passage of voter identification laws and laws imposing harsh restrictions on voter registration drives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a top Pennsylvania Republican remarked last month that the state's new voter ID law would help Mitt Romney win Pennsylvania in November, which no Republican presidential candidate has done since 1988, he reignited a debate over whether the law is intended to curb fraud, as Republicans say, or to depress Democratic turnout, as critics charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Turzai, the House majority leader in Pennsylvania, made the remark when he spoke to a meeting of the Republican State Committee. He ticked off a number of recent conservative achievements by the Republican-led legislature, including, as Turzai put it, &quot;Voter ID, which is going to allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, has demonstrated that in 2008, even if Obama had failed to boost turnout among key Democratic groups, he would have won because of the failure of many 2004 George W. Bush supporters to vote for John McCain. &quot;Bush voters' decisions not to vote or to support Obama were a sufficient condition for Obama's victory,&quot; Lupia wrote in &quot;Did Bush Voters Cause Obama's Victory?&quot; a paper published in PS, the journal of the American Political Science Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney and the Republican Party must achieve the highest possible turnout level among whites. Republicans, including Romney, have adopted anti-immigration stands that have extinguished the possibility of boosting margins among Hispanics. Asian Americans have become increasingly Democratic, self-identifying in public opinion surveys as Democratic rather than Republican by a 52-32 margin. African Americans remain reliably loyal to the Democratic Party by an 86 to 8 percent margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney is particularly vulnerable to a campaign designed to suppress turnout because his support is more tepid than Obama's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New York Times/CBS poll released on Wednesday found that 52 percent of Obama voters back their candidate strongly, compared to 29 percent of Romney voters. In addition, a third of Romney's voters say they are voting for him because of their dislike of Obama, while only 8 percent of Obama voters are primarily motivated by their hostility to Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vote suppression is important for Obama because his numbers among whites without degrees are worsening, despite the omnipresence of anti-Romney ads in the battleground states. Obama's 29 percent level of support among non-college white men in the Quinnipiac poll cited above is a drop from 32 percent in its April survey, and the 28 percent level in the ABC/Washington Post poll is a drop from 34 percent in their May survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his margins in this group falling, Obama directly benefits from every white non-college voter who stays home and does not vote for Romney. The importance of vote suppression in a close contest can be seen in the following hypothetical: say there are 1,000 voters evenly split, 500 to 500. Candidate A persuades just one of the voters backing his opponent to fail to go to the polls. Candidate A wins 500 to 499.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Obama, hurdles in recruiting whites without a college degree are particularly high because of the employment patterns illustrated in this chart produced by RBC Capital Markets, which shows the devastating consequences of the 2008 financial collapse on non-college workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters of all races and ethnicities without college have taken a hit in the job market; politically, however, the drop in employment is most damaging to Obama among whites. African Americans without college degrees are not only loyal to the Democratic Party, but the election puts at risk a second term for the nation's first black president. Hispanics without college have a president who has taken a liberal stand on immigration reform, backed the DREAM Act and appointed the first Hispanic justice, Sonia Sotomayor, to the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems Obama and the Democratic Party face with white non-college voters have deep roots. A study conducted by political consulting firm CRG Communications for the Democratic National Committee in 1985 reached conclusions about the defection of working class whites to the Republican Party that remain relevant in 2012. CRG reported that these defectors believed that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Democratic Party has not stood with them as they moved from the working to the middle class. They have a whole set of middle class economic problems today, and the Democratic Party is not helping them. Instead it is helping the blacks, Hispanics and the poor. They feel betrayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looked at this way, CRG reported, key Democratic constituencies - affluent liberals, gay rights activists, ethnic and racial minorities - were &quot;leaving the 'common man' out of the picture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demographic trends - the steady decline of the share of the population made up of non-college whites, from 86 percent in 1940 to 48 percent in 2007 - have made winning these voters by increasingly large margins crucial to the Republican Party, while diminishing the Democratic Party's need for their support. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2012 election will be another test of strength in the decade-long competition between this white voting bloc - which dominated in 2002, 2004 and 2010 - and such ascendant Democratic constituencies as Hispanics, college-educated women and young voters, who flexed their muscles in 2006 and 2008.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Senator Scott P. Brown's campaign in Massachusetts released a two-and-a-half minute Web video aimed at Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Brown's Democratic challenger in the Senate race, and President Obama.&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Senator Scott P. Brown's campaign in Massachusetts released a two-and-a-half-minute Web video on Monday aimed at both Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Brown's Democratic challenger in the Senate race, and President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Called &quot;Let America Be America Again,&quot; the advertisement shows Democratic presidents like John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Lyndon B. Johnson making glowing references to America's free enterprise system. It includes an ode to free enterprise by a Republican president, Ronald Reagan (who won Massachusetts twice). It then contrasts them sharply with video first of Mr. Obama, then of Ms. Warren, the two of them seeming to argue against entrepreneurial success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad amplifies one made last week for Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, which is not surprising since Mr. Romney and Mr. Brown share some of the same political strategists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is unusual for Mr. Brown is that he links himself so closely with a major new theme of the Romney campaign. Mr. Brown, a Republican running in deep-blue Massachusetts, has been trying to distance himself from Mr. Romney and their party, constantly referring to his independence in ads and at campaign events. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But here, they share the same message. The Brown video, coming after the Romney video, is like a mirror within a Romney mirror. It was Ms. Warren who first articulated the importance of government in this particular way, as essential to individual success; the Romney/Brown camp framed her argument, and Mr. Obama's, as an attack against individual success. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own,&quot; Ms. Warren said at a small political house party in Massachusetts  as she began her campaign last year. &quot;You built a factory out there, good for you. But I want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video of Ms. Warren, which went viral, cut both ways. Her supporters saw it as an inspirational message of a passionate populist who could articulate the positive role that government played in building the country. Her opponents saw it as alarming evidence of an angry socialist who did not appreciate the power of individual entrepreneurs and who would tax and regulate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brown team had been hitting Ms. Warren on this theme since she first brought it up at the house party last year. But when Mr. Obama echoed Ms. Warren's theme at a campaign rally in Roanoke, Va., on July 13, he gave the Brown team the opportunity to reprise its attack on Ms. Warren on a much bigger canvass. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help,&quot; he said. &quot;There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business -- you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;Look, if you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own. You didn't get there on your own. I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because 'I was just so smart.' There are a lot of smart people out there. 'It must be because I worked harder than everybody else.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign used the words in a devastating, if distorted, Web video last week, which it then turned into a television commercial. It omitted the reference to teachers, roads and bridges so Mr. Obama was seen saying, without qualification: &quot;If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney&nbsp;ad also showed the owner of a small factory in New Hampshire who says he built his business with hard work and asks why Mr. Obama is &quot;demonizing&quot; workers like him. (The Union Leader in Manchester reported later on Monday that the factory owner, Jack Gilchrist of Gilchrist Metal Fabricating in Hudson, N.H., had received government aid through several bonds, contracts and loans.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Brown ad, Mr. Brown promises never to &quot;demonize&quot; business owners, the work they do or the opportunities they create. It also uses the same truncated clip of Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video may be somewhat risky for Mr. Brown because Massachusetts is almost certain to vote overwhelmingly for Mr. Obama. But the video is arresting, with its majestic music and its images of other Democratic presidents in a positive light. It could reach independent voters who are troubled by the implications of Ms. Warren's assertion that no one in this country &quot;got rich on his own.&quot; And if Mr. Romney and Mr. Brown's strategists are lucky, it could raise doubts in their minds about Mr. Obama, too.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new television ad, President Obama speaks directly into the camera to present what he says is a big choice facing voters when they go to the polls in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, which his campaign says will run in nine battleground states, is different in tone from many of the previous commercials from Mr. Obama and his rival, Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than use flashy graphics, ominous-sounding narrators or clever editing, the ad shows Mr. Obama arguing that the election comes down to a choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not just between two political parties or even two people. It's a choice between two very different plans for our country,&quot; Mr. Obama says. &quot;Sometimes politics can seem very small. But the choice you face, it couldn't be bigger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad comes after weeks in which Mr. Obama's campaign and his Democratic allies have been hammering Mr. Romney's corporate experience and his personal finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial is critical of Mr. Romney's economic approach; the president says it was what &quot;caused the mess in the first place.&quot; But the bulk of the ad is a plea for votes on behalf of what Mr. Obama calls his desire to &quot;create an economy built to last&quot; by strengthening the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the campaign, the ad will run in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1014 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mitt Romney's refusal to release more of his old tax returns shows that a smart, calculating businessman can make dumb political decisions. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever his reasons, Mitt Romney's stonewalling on releasing more of his old tax returns than the 2010 return he made public shows that a smart, calculating businessman can make dumb political decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lots of people in politics, who admittedly know nothing about what's on those returns, think Romney must be doing a cost-benefit analysis. They guess that he concluded that the benefit (openness that would please editorial boards and might reduce media demands for details) is outweighed by the cost (whatever embarrassment might be found in the returns, or perhaps a feeling that the issue invades his legitimate privacy).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One expert on political embarrassment, Bill Clinton, said on CNN last week that he had &quot;no idea&quot; why Romney hadn't released more of his tax returns. &quot;Whatever it is,&quot; Clinton said, &quot;it couldn't be as bad as not doing it.&quot; Clinton pointed out that Romney &quot;obviously had concluded&quot; that it would be more damaging to release the returns than not to release them, before adding, &quot;it's hard to imagine that that's true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As someone who has covered earlier clamor over candidates' tax returns, I would go one step further than &quot;hard to imagine.&quot; I would say &quot;unimaginable.&quot; There is no way he could be hurt worse if he made one big document dump of tax returns, going back several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Releasing returns is, despite George Romney's pioneering 1968 example, a rather recent phenomenon. And a dull one, since most politicians have fairly routine returns that chill media voyeurism. Disclosures usually produce one or two boring stories about esoteric provisions of the tax code and a politician's preferences among charities or something about hardly giving much at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the most recent controversy: about Dick Cheney's returns in 2000. He had gotten rich since leaving the post of secretary of defense for the oil business, and was reluctant to make his taxes public. Finally, late on the Friday of Labor Day weekend, a time chosen for minimal coverage, the vice presidential candidate released &quot;summaries&quot; of his returns for the years 1992 through 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of a handful of reporters still at work, I was assigned the story. The release showed that he had earned $20.7 million since leaving the Pentagon, and had given a measly 1.01 percent of that to charity. He hated my story, which ran that Saturday, probably because it made him look like a cheapskate (though the point about charity was more than halfway down the story). He complained to his running mate, George W. Bush, who used an open microphone to call me a name The Times will not print, and that became the story for a couple of days. But nobody cared about Cheney's taxes once he had made a diclosure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The returns of an earlier vice presidential candidate, Geraldine A. Ferraro, created longer-lasting problems. But that was because her 1984 disclosure raised questions about whether she had properly reported ties to her husband's business on House ethics forms. And it did not help that one of that real estate company's tenants was a pornographer with possible mob connections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither of these episodes should worry Romney. Everything about the 2010 returns he did release shows careful, detailed accounting on a level far above Ferraro's. And we know he donates very generously to the Mormon Church and other charities. He gives far more than the biblical injunction to tithe a tenth of all he earns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people suspect the Romney returns hide more information about offshore tax shelters or dealings with companies whose affairs can be portrayed as shady. But that's already happened, and more information would not deepen whatever impact the Obama&nbsp;ad citing the Cayman Islands has already made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most serious risk outsiders have imagined is that some recent return, especially 2009's, showed no tax liability, even though a campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, insisted Romney had never paid zero income taxes. But paying &quot;next to nothing,&quot; resulting from capital losses and various legal deductions, normal and creative, is distinctly possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember Richard M. Nixon. In 1973, as the Watergate noose began to tighten, he released some data about his homes in San Clemente and Key Biscayne. They included huge mortgage payments and substantial property taxes. Combined with a deduction he had acknowledged taking for donating his vice presidential papers, it led me to write for The Baltimore Sun that he may have paid no income taxes in 1970 or 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was wrong. When pressure forced him to release his returns that December, they showed he paid $792.81 in 1970 and $878.03 in 1971. &quot;Next to nothing&quot; didn't help him. A Congressional committee then audited his returns and he paid more taxes. Tax cheating was considered but ultimately rejected as a ground for impeachment by the House Judiciary Committee in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So &quot;next to nothing&quot; had a downside for Nixon. It would hurt Romney, too, because the only positive argument he makes for his candidacy is his years as a businessman who got rich, and he has a knack for seeming distant from ordinary Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's not comparable to the publicity impact on Nixon, who was already widely considered tricky or sleazy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's not as much harm as letting the issue drag on will do. The subject may come and go in the summer, but it won't go away. Someday, in the debates with Obama if not before, Romney is going to be questioned more intensely than he has been so far, and what will he say when asked, &quot;Have you ever paid federal income taxes as low as 1 percent of your income? Five percent? What's the lowest you ever paid?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich Galen, a Republican commentator, said no one in the general public cares about Romney's taxes. Perhaps, but a lingering issue like this drives a campaign off message, as Cheney and Bush found out in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the more typical response from Republican strategists is, &quot;Whatever is there, get it out and move on.&quot; Perhaps late on a Friday, during the Olympics.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''A hundred million dollars is nothing,'' the venture capitalist Andy Rappaport told me back in the summer of 2004. This was at a moment when wealthy liberals like George Soros and Peter Lewis were looking to influence national politics by financing their own voter-turnout machine and TV ads and by creating an investment fund for start-ups. Rappaport's statement struck me as an expression of supreme hubris. In American politics at that time, $100 million really meant something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight years later, of course, his pronouncement seems quaint. Conservative groups alone, including a super PAC led by Karl Rove and another group backed by the brothers Charles and David Koch, will likely spend more than a billion dollars trying to take down Barack Obama by the time November rolls around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for this exponential leap in political spending, if you talk to most Democrats or read most news reports, comes down to two words: Citizens United. The term is shorthand for a Supreme Court decision that gave corporations much of the same right to political speech as individuals have, thus removing virtually any restriction on corporate money in politics. The oft-repeated narrative of 2012 goes like this: Citizens United unleashed a torrent of money from businesses and the multimillionaires who run them, and as a result we are now seeing the corporate takeover of American politics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a matter of political strategy, this is a useful story to tell, appealing to liberals and independent voters who aren't necessarily enthusiastic about the administration but who are concerned about societal inequality, which is why President Obama has made it a rallying cry almost from the moment the Citizens United ruling was made. But if you're trying to understand what's really going on with politics and money, the accepted narrative around Citizens United is, at best, overly simplistic. And in some respects, it's just plain wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It helps first to understand what Citizens United did and didn't do to change the opaque rules governing outside money. Go back to, say, 2007, and pretend you're a conservative donor. At this moment, you would still have been free to write a check for any amount to a 527 -- so named because of the shadowy provision in the tax code that made such groups legal. (America Coming Together and the infamous Swift Boat Veterans for Truth were both 527s.) Even corporations, though they couldn't contribute to a candidate or a party, were free to write unlimited checks to something called a social-welfare group, whose principal purpose, ostensibly, is issue advocacy rather than political activity. The anti-tax Club for Growth, for instance, is a social-welfare group. So, remarkably, is the Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity and Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were, however, a few caveats when it came to the way these groups could spend their money. Neither a 527 nor a social-welfare group could engage in ''express advocacy'' -- that is, overtly making the case for one candidate over another. Nor could they use corporate money for ''electioneering communications'' -- a category defined as radio or television advertising that even mentions a candidate's name within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. So under the old rules, the Club for Growth couldn't broadcast an ad that said ''Vote Against Barack Obama,'' but it could spend that money on as many ads as it wanted that said ''Barack Obama has ruined America -- call and tell him to stop!'' as long as it did so more than 60 days before an election. (The distinction between those two ads may sound silly and arcane to you, but that's why you don't sit on the Federal Election Commission.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizens United and a couple of related court decisions changed all of this in two essential ways, and each of them was more incremental than transformational. First, the Supreme Court wiped away much of the rigmarole about ''express advocacy'' and ''electioneering.'' Now any outside group can use corporate money to make a direct case for who deserves your vote and why, and they can do so right up to Election Day. The second change is that the old 527s have now been made effectively obsolete, replaced by the super PAC. The main difference between a super PAC and a social-welfare group, practically speaking, is that a super PAC has to disclose the identity of its donors, while social-welfare groups generally do not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who criticize the effect of Citizens United look at these very technical changes and see an obvious causal relationship. The high court says outside groups are allowed to use corporate dollars to expressly support candidates, and suddenly we have this tidal wave of money threatening to overwhelm the airways. One must have led to the other, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, not necessarily. Legally speaking, zillionaires were no less able to write fat checks four years ago than they are today. And while it is true that corporations can now give money for specific purposes that were prohibited before, it seems they aren't, or at least not at a level that accounts for anything like the sudden influx of money into the system. According to a brief filed by Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, and Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment lawyer, in a Montana case on which the Supreme Court ruled last month, not a single Fortune 100 company contributed to a candidate's super PAC during this year's Republican primaries. Of the $96 million or more raised by these super PACs, only about 13 percent came from privately held corporations, and less than 1 percent came from publicly traded corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This only tells part of the story. The general election has just begun, and big energy and health care companies may still be pouring money into social-welfare groups that don't have to disclose their donors. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington reported last month, for instance, that Aetna anonymously contributed more than $7 million to two such groups. We may never know precisely how much money is coming from similar companies, which should alarm anyone who cares about the integrity and transparency of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the best anecdotal evidence suggests that this kind of thing isn't happening in nearly the proportions you might expect. Kenneth Gross, an election lawyer who represents an array of large corporations, told me that few of his clients have contributed to the social-welfare groups engaged in political activity this year. They know those contributions might become public at some point, and no company that sells a product wants to risk the kind of consumer reaction that engulfed Target in 2010, after it contributed $150,000 to a Minnesota group backing a conservative candidate opposing gay marriage. ''If you've got a bank on every corner, if you've got stores in every strip mall, you don't want to be associated with a social cause,'' Gross told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of this is to say that Citizens United hasn't had an impact. Gross and others point out that in the era before Citizens United, while individuals and companies could still contribute huge sums to outside groups, they were to some extent deterred by the confusing web of rules and the liability they might incur for violations. What the new rulings did, as the experts like to put it, was to ''lift the cloud of uncertainty'' that hung over such expenditures, and the effect of this psychological shift should not be underestimated. It almost certainly accounts for some rise in political money this year, both from individuals and companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, the Supreme Court's ruling really wasn't the sort of tectonic event that Obama and his allies would have you believe it was. ''I'd go so far as to call it a liberal delusion,'' Ira Glasser, the former executive director of the A.C.L.U. and a liberal dissenter on Citizens United, told me. Which leads to an obvious question: If Citizens United doesn't explain this billion-dollar blast of outside money, then what does?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may remember that back in the '90s, the most nefarious influence in politics emanated from what was then called ''soft money'' -- basically, unlimited contributions from rich people, corporations and labor unions to both major parties. According to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, in 2000, the last presidential year in which soft money was legal, the two parties raised more than $450 million of it, divided almost equally between them. Only 38 percent of that came from individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That all changed with the passage of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, popularly known as the McCain-Feingold law. The new law stamped out soft money for good, but it also created a vacuum in political fund-raising. The parties could no longer tap an endless stream of soft money, but thanks to the advent of the 527, rich ideologues with their own agendas could write massive checks for the purpose of building what were, essentially, shadow parties -- independent groups with their own turnout and advertising campaigns, limited in what they could say but accountable to no candidate or party boss. Wealthy liberals like Soros and Lewis, along with groups like MoveOn.org, were the first to spot the opportunity. All told, wealthy liberals spent something close to $200 million in an effort to oust George W. Bush in 2004, setting an entirely new standard for outside spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard L. Hasen, an expert on campaign finance at the University of California at Irvine, recently wrote an article for Slate titled, ''The Numbers Don't Lie,'' in which he showed that total outside spending, as measured through March 8 of every election season, seemed to explode after the Citizens United decision, reaching about $15.9 million in 2010 (compared with $1.8 million in the previous midterm cycle) and $88 million this year (compared with $37.5 million at the same point in 2008). ''If this was not caused by Citizens United,'' he wrote, ''we have a mighty big coincidence on our hands.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are alternate ways to interpret this data. The level of outside money increased 164 percent from 2004 to 2008. Then it rose 135 percent from 2008 to 2012. In other words, while the sheer amount of dollars seems considerably more ominous after Citizens United, the percentage of change from one presidential election to the next has remained pretty consistent since the passage of McCain-Feingold. And this suggests that the rising amount of outside money was probably bound to reach ever more staggering levels with or without Citizens United. The unintended consequence of McCain-Feingold was to begin a gradual migration of political might from inside the party structure to outside it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in his examination of raw numbers, Hasen managed to ignore what is probably the most relevant bit of data during this period: 2010 and 2012 were the first election cycles since the enactment of McCain-Feingold in which a Democrat occupied the White House. Rich conservatives weren't inspired to invest their fortunes in 2004, when Bush ran for the second time while waging an unpopular war, or in 2008, when they were forced to endure the nomination of McCain. But now there's a president and a legislative agenda they bitterly despise (much as Soros and his friends saw the Bush presidency as an existential threat to the country), so it's not surprising that outside spending by Republicans in 2010 and 2012 would dwarf everything that came before. What we are seeing -- what we almost certainly would have seen even without the court's ruling in Citizens United -- is the full force of conservative wealth in America, mobilized by a common enemy for the first time since the fall of party monopolies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A consequence of McCain-Feingold has been to flip on its head an old truism of politics, which is that incumbency comes with a fixed financial advantage. In the era of soft money, controlling the White House meant that a party could almost always leverage its considerable resources to dominate fund-raising. But today it's much easier to tap into the fury and anxiety of out-of-power millionaires than it is to amass contributions in defense of the status quo. This dynamic probably explains why wealthy Democrats who pioneered the idea of outside money during the Bush years have largely stood down this year, even while conservative fund-raising has soared. It isn't that liberals don't like Obama or grow queasy at the mention of super PACs. It's a function of human nature: nobody really gets pumped up to write a $10 million check just to keep things more or less as they are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're a Democrat, there's some good news here. One persistent fear you hear from liberals is that Citizens United altered the balance between the parties in a permanent way -- that corporate money will give Republicans a structural advantage that can never be overcome. What's more likely is that the boom in outside money will prove to be cyclical, with the momentum swinging toward whoever feels shut out and persecuted at the moment. Liberals dominated outside spending in 2004 and 2006. And should Romney become president, they'll most likely do so again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's worth asking just how much an advantage all of this outside money actually confers. The greatest impact of this year's imbalance in outside money will be felt on the state level, where a lot of House seats and control of the Senate hang in the balance, and where a sharp gust of advertising can often blow the results in one direction or another. But a presidential campaign is different, focusing as it does on a dozen or so pivotal states and a limited number of advertising markets. There's probably a limit to how many 30-second spots all of these groups can cram onto cable stations during late-night showings of ''Turner &amp; Hooch.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recently called Carter Eskew, a longtime Democratic adman and strategist whose clients included Al Gore in 2000, and asked him a simple question: How much did he think he would really need for a candidate today, if he could have an unlimited budget to run a national ad campaign, including all the outside money? Eskew paused before giving a declarative answer: $500 million. Anything beyond that, he said, was probably overkill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, there's a threshold below which a presidential candidate can't really compete effectively, and that number -- whether it's $500 million or something less -- is outlandish enough that it should give us pause. But beyond that number, it's not clear that spending an extra $200 million or $500 million will really make all that much of a difference on Election Day. More likely, the two ideological factions are now like rivals of the nuclear age, stockpiling enough bombs to destroy the same cities over and over again, when one would do the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You could even argue that whatever benefit a campaign derives from all this money is balanced, somewhat, by the threat it poses. Back in the days of soft money, a candidate had ownership of his party's national apparatus and the accusations it hurled on prime-time TV. He was responsible for the integrity of his argument, and his advisers ultimately controlled it. What the reform-minded architects of McCain-Feingold inadvertently unleashed, what Citizens United intensified but by no means created, is a world in which a big part of the money in a presidential campaign is spent by political entrepreneurs and strategists who are unanswerable to any institution. Candidates and parties who become the vehicles of angry outsiders, as Mitt Romney is now, don't really have control of their own campaigns anymore; to a large extent, they are the instruments of volatile forces beyond their own reckoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe that makes for a cleaner and more democratic system than the one we had before, in the way the campaign-finance reformers intended. Standing here in 2012, it's just hard to see how.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most influential political strategist of the 2012 campaign works out of an unmarked suite in an anonymous office park in suburban Virginia, a few floors above a Japanese-themed steakhouse. He does not work for one of the presidential campaigns. He is not a pundit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Carl Forti, a low-profile Buffalo native who served as the political director of Mitt Romney's first White House campaign, will deploy at least $400 million in political money this season, more than Senator John McCain spent running for president in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After years in the Republican Party trenches, Mr. Forti, 40, is now a consultant and strategist for the biggest of the outside groups and ''super PACs'' that are rapidly displacing parties as the means for raising and spending vast amounts of political money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In those roles, his work embodies the coordinated punch brought by like-minded groups to the effort to oust President Obama and give Republicans full control of Congress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as a veteran of Mr. Romney's inner circle, he brings to the effort a keen understanding of the Romney campaign's needs even as he is barred by campaign finance law from working directly with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Forti is the political director of American Crossroads, the super PAC founded by his mentor, Karl Rove; Mr. Forti's firm, the Black Rock Group, is a consultant to tax-exempt groups like the 60 Plus Association, which are expected to spend millions of dollars on ads this fall; and he is a founder of Restore Our Future, the super PAC that helped Mr. Romney in his bid for this year's Republican presidential nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, with Mr. Romney prohibited from spending much of the cash he is raising until after the Republican convention in August, Mr. Forti and his clients are filling in the breach: Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, Restore Our Future and other Forti-linked groups have spent at least $35 million on advertising in 17 states against Mr. Obama since early April, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, American Crossroads announced that it would begin a $9 million, nine-state campaign defending Mr. Romney against the Obama campaign's attacks on his tenure at Bain Capital. The ads signify a pronounced shift in strategy for Crossroads, which has spent heavily on advertising attacking Mr. Obama, and demonstrate how super PACs and outside groups can synchronize with the candidates they support without violating federal rules that prohibit direct coordination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What happened to Barack Obama?'' the narrator in the ad asks. ''The press and even Democrats say his attacks on Mitt Romney's business record are misleading, unfair and untrue.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rove and others crisscross the country raising most of the money, tapping a network of wealthy conservatives and business executives determined to see Mr. Obama defeated. But at Crossroads and Restore Our Future, it is chiefly Mr. Forti who figures out how to spend it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing on his political acumen and knowledge of the swing-state political terrain built over three election cycles at the National Republican Campaign Committee, which oversees Republican strategy for House races, Mr. Forti trolls through reams of polling data, picks targets, approves scripts and helps negotiate with television stations for airtime in significant markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the advertising has been placed through a company called Crossroads Media, founded by one of Mr. Forti's Black Rock partners and housed in the same office suite. So far this cycle, Crossroads and Restore Our Future have broadcast ads in about 40 Senate and House races as well as the presidential race, officials at the groups said, a breadth unmatched in the world of independent spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We came up through the party infrastructure, where you are forced to look at the entire national battlefield,'' said Brian O. Walsh, a friend and former colleague of Mr. Forti's who directs the American Action Network, a tax-exempt group closely allied with Crossroads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Crossroads and its tax-exempt affiliate, Crossroads GPS, are expected to spend $300 million on the presidential campaign and Senate races; Restore Our Future is planning to raise at least $100 million and possibly more. Americans for Job Security, a tax-exempt trade association that spent $9 million in 2010 but is not required to release the names of its donors, shares office space with Black Rock and retains one of Mr. Forti's partners as a consultant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Forti, whose clients prize his discretion almost as much as his expertise, declined to be interviewed for this article. But he is well known to watchdog groups tracking the explosive growth of outside spending this year -- and is feared by the Democratic candidates who have been pummeled by Crossroads ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He's pretty good at keeping his name out of the papers,'' said Melanie Sloan, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ''He needs big donors to know he's there -- and no one else.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Forti also helps lead a monthly meeting known as the Weaver Terrace Group, where officials from a variety of conservative groups, like the American Action Network, gather at the Crossroads offices to plan their political spending. (Several other groups that attend, like Americans for Tax Reform and the Republican Jewish Coalition, have also received large grants from Crossroads, enabling them to run their own large-issue ad campaigns.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meetings allow an extraordinary level of coordination on the right: over the last month or so, conservative groups have taken turns pounding Mr. Obama in critical states like Florida, Iowa and Michigan, the advertising buys dovetailing to ensure a constant barrage. And the enormous budgets that Crossroads and its allies now command allow for high-quality advertising with production values on a par with presidential campaigns, said several consultants who work for outside groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Forti's own career is a case study in the evolution of unrestricted money and outside groups from the margins to the mainstream of American politics. He spent seven and a half years at the House campaign committee. In his last year, 2006, he supervised its $80 million ''independent expenditure'' campaign, so called because the spending is financed by the party but cannot be coordinated with the party's candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional scandals and the war in Iraq helped turn that election into a Democratic rout, with Republicans losing control of the House of Representatives. But the effort cemented Mr. Forti's reputation as a master of the complicated legal and logistical demands of independent spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He's a Gatling gun,'' said Thomas M. Reynolds, a former Republican congressman from New York who was the chairman of the House committee that year. ''He's got multiple races going at any given time. Carl's unflappable, disciplined and focused.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the race for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, Mr. Forti was Mr. Romney's political director, serving alongside the two men with whom he founded Restore Our Future last year: Charles R. Spies, the campaign's chief counsel, and Larry McCarthy, a veteran ad creator. When Mr. Romney dropped out of the 2008 race, Mr. Forti signed on with Freedom's Watch, a conservative group that spent at least $30 million in an effort to counterbalance liberal groups like MoveOn.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Forti has often worked at the edge of the regulatory envelope that governs outside spending. Freedom's Watch ignored a demand from the Federal Election Commission that it disclose its finances, after reports that the casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson had provided virtually all of the group's financing and was directing its political spending, a circumstance that would normally have stripped the tax-exempt group of its right to keep its donors private. (The commission's Republican and Democratic members deadlocked on pursuing the investigation, leaving the group's finances undisclosed.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2009, after Mr. Forti founded the Black Rock Group with two other Republican consultants, the company sought a legal opinion from the election commission that would have allowed it to solicit money from donors and coordinate spending without registering as a political committee. The proposal, which would have allowed the donors to spend money on political advertising without being subject to contribution limits, was not approved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Draper's story about Priorities USA Action, the pro-Obama super PAC, is the most interesting political story of the week. One takeaway is that Priorities USA really does have a big role in the campaign. The tepid pace of the recovery suggests that Obama can't run on a ''look what we did'' platform. He can only persuade Americans that Mitt Romney won't make things better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JONATHAN CHAIT, posted on nymag.com </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I've read about the woes of Priorities USA pitching fastidious left-leaning multimillionaires who turn up their noses at super PACs, I've wondered whether Priorities couldn't go to the highways and byways as its predecessors did and raise significant money from small donors. . . . Would this cannibalize the fund-raising of the Obama campaign and the D.N.C., or could it squeeze additional dollars out of the base? I would donate to Priorities if it asked me -- at $100 a shot, not a million. How many others would?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well of course the Democrats are trying to catch up in the super-PAC game. What choice do they have? Turn on your television. Everything is a competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRILLIAN, New York, posted on nytimes.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I note this nugget from Draper's piece: The Democratic super PAC Priorities USA Action did some polling on Romney. Here's one thing they found (and place your hand below your jaw, so you don't hurt yourself as it hits the table): ''For example, when Priorities informed a focus group that Romney supported the Ryan budget plan -- and thus championed 'ending Medicare as we know it' -- while also advocating tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, the respondents simply refused to believe any politician would do such a thing.'' There's some word beyond ''perverse'' for that -- a politician benefiting from the fact that his plans and commitments are so radical that voters simply can't believe he'd pursue them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''To score a big-name dinner guest or a favor from a V.I.P. in Washington, there was no point messing around with official channels or wasting time with midlevel functionaries,'' Franklin Foer writes. As a result ''there's an unexpected naivete among the truly powerful; they assume that anyone who has arrived at their desk has survived the scrutiny of handlers.''

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE DRONE ZONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some may shrug and say that the undisclosed high-altitude tracking of U.S. vehicles for training purposes is harmless, but the line between civilian privacy and an increasingly Orwellian capacity of the federal government to track its own citizens is blurred just a bit more by this practice. There are already serious concerns about U.S. military drones -- designed for warfare abroad -- being repurposed for civilian purposes. . . . The problem with an ever powerful national government with more and more tools to control and track its citizenry is that these powers, legal and technical, are often abused and used in ways not originally intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STEVE CLEMONS, posted on theatlantic.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if we haven't been using surface craft, helicopters, aircraft and commercial airlines to practice our skills and the status of our equipment on Navy ships for longer than you've been alive -- tracking cars is a tempest in a teapot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RICK HORNER, Georgia, posted on nytimes.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the drone operators have not flown real planes, let us not call them pilots. Call them drone operators. It is still a job of high responsibility and skill. In this age of instant news and ubiquitous cameras, a wrong aim reverberates around the world. Did a pilot in the Second World War face the instantaneous, international shame of a missed bomb? No, it was only his own conscience and pride he had to answer to. But a drone operator has to come home and watch the carnage on the television while having dinner with his family. You may not give the drone operators medals for bravery, but applaud their dedication, sense of responsibility and the seriousness of their mission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Another news organization forbids its reporters from letting sources approve quotes for publication. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">            The National Journal said over the weekend that it was banning the use of quotations that have been massaged or manipulated, joining a growing chorus of news organizations that are objecting to a practice that has become increasingly common in political journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">            In a memo to the staff, Ron Fournier, National Journal's editor in chief, said, &quot;If a public official wants to use NJ as a platform for his/her point of view, the price of admission is a quote that is on-record, unedited and unadulterated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">            Quote approval has become accepted in Washington and on the campaign trail, with politicians and candidates often refusing to grant interviews unless they have final say over how their quotations appear in print. The New York Times examined the issuein an article last week, drawing attention to a problematic side of newsgathering that journalists had long complained about but felt pressured into accepting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">            Both the Obama and Romney campaigns routinely demand that reporters consent to quote approval when giving interviews. If the reporters agree, quotes from campaign officials, advisers and candidates' family members have to be sent to a press aide for the final go-ahead. Quotes sent back to reporters are often edited for style and clarity - in effect, polished up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If reporters refuse, they are not granted an interview. National Journal is among several news outlets that have said they find quote-approval to be troubling, especially now that it has become standard operating procedure for many politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times has said it encourages its reporters to push back against sources who demand quote approval and it is reviewing how its policies might address the issue. The Washington Examiner said last week that it, too, would not accept interviews granted under the condition of quote approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politico's editor in chief, John Harris, said that he advises reporters to resist such conditions on an interview and expressed dismay that political figures are becoming more and more comfortable avoiding on-the-record interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Journalists need to work hard to make sure we are doing everything possible to insist on accessibility and accountability,&quot; Mr. Harris said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outlook; Pg. B02</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1202 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">1. Negative ads are more effective than positive ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labeling ads as simply &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; obscures considerable diversity within each category. A review of more than 100 scientific studies found no conclusive difference between negative and positive ads, broadly defined, in their ability to win votes or affect turnout.          However, specific types of negative and positive advertising do have distinct consequences. Spots that stir up positive emotions such as hope, pride and enthusiasm stimulate voters' interest and participation in an election. They also polarize the electorate by activating the partisanship of supporters and opponents who see the ads. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan's &quot;Morning in America&quot; ads featured uplifting music and bright images of happy workers, American flags and weddings. They established a standard for feel-good advertising that candidates of both parties have copied ever since.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ads that trigger fear are better at persuading voters because they loosen the grip of partisanship. They scare voters into paying attention to new information about the candidates and issues, making them more likely to change their minds. President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 &quot;Daisy&quot; ad, for example, dramatically raised the specter of a nuclear conflict at the Cold War's height. More recent ads have used dark images and ominous voice-overs to stoke fear about crime, immigration, terrorism, health care and jobs.Anger, by contrast, does little to change minds; instead, it mobilizes voters to fight for their convictions. Campaign ads arouse anger by suggesting that people have been unfairly hurt and then casting blame, such as a recent Mitt Romney spot (&quot;Where Did All the Money Go?&quot;) that tries to incite outrage at President Obama by saying that he misspent stimulus funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Political ads are too multifaceted to be labeled simply as negative or positive - and to conclude that one type is superior to the other.                    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">2. Campaign ads are uninformative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a minimum, ads boost candidates' name recognition, which helps offset an incumbent's inherent advantage. But they also teach voters a great deal about where candidates stand.Because they reach people who might not seek out news or information about the candidates, ads can narrow the gap between uninformed voters and political junkies. Over the past 40 years, while politicians have been flooding TV and radio with spots highlighting their policy positions, conventional news sources have devoted less and less coverage to substantive policy differences, instead focusing on political strategy and poll results. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign ads are brief, one-sided and occasionally misleading. Nonetheless, they provide broad access to information that many voters would not otherwise get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">3. Less-informed voters are more easily swayed by ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But aren't those uninformed voters also easy prey for the emotionally manipulative tactics that media consultants deploy? Not so much. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We respond emotionally to things we care about. Political advertising arouses the strongest reactions in those who care and know the most about politics. In 2006, a Republican National Committee ad showed Osama bin Laden threatening Americans over the sounds of a ticking clock and a thumping heartbeat. Informed voters are more likely to respond emotionally and politically to this sort of ad, in part because they have the type of strong partisan convictions that are undermined by fear ads (or activated by feel-good ads). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          An ad's timing matters as much as its content. Spots criticizing an opponent tend to work differently early and late in campaigns. Before people have settled on a candidate, attack ads help them make up their minds. But these same ads depress turnout when seen later by voters who have already chosen which candidate to support.                                 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">4. A candidate should respond to an attack </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> with a counterattack on the same issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases, such a response may make sense; in others, it is precisely the wrong thing to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If an accusation cuts to the core of a candidate's strength - say, the 2004 &quot;swift boat&quot; ad assault on John Kerry's war service in Vietnam - then a strong rebuttal, preferably with evidence, might be warranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, however, these counterattacks pull candidates off their message. Research suggests that it's better to spend ad dollars highlighting issues that play to a candidate's strengths - such as those on which she has built a solid reputation or on which voters prefer her stance - rather than engaging an opponent on his issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, for example, should probably not devote many ads to the fight against terrorism, an issue on which Obama fares relatively well in polling, or to the environment, a subject where Democrats have a reputational advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, airing ads denying that you are a witch, as Christine O'Donnell did in her failed 2010 Senate bid, feeds a campaign theme that is unlikely to improve your odds on Election Day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">5. News organizations neutralize misleading ads by fact-checking them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">                    Such news stories may be well-intentioned, but there is no clear evidence that they reliably undercut misleading claims or manipulative tactics. Part of this may be because of volume; ads are repeated and reach many people who don't watch, listen to or read the news.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter psychology also plays a role. While some news stories may weaken an ad's effectiveness, many media reports end up extending the reach of the misleading statements they are trying to debunk: People hear the claim and remember it better than the journalist's correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, CNN ran &quot;ad watch&quot; segments pointing out that Bill Clinton's attacks on President George H.W. Bush's handling of the economy were misleading and that Bush's attacks on Clinton for raising taxes as governor were hypocritical. In both cases, viewers came away with more favorable views of the candidate whose ad was being criticized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This tendency is exacerbated by the audience's strong partisan convictions. Research shows that partisans tend to persist in believing inaccurate information, even after it is corrected, when that information makes their party look better or makes the other party look worse.                       tbrader@umich.edu                                 </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1142 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Negative ads are more effective than positive ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labeling ads as simply &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; obscures considerable diversity within each category. A review of more than 100 scientific studies found no conclusive difference between negative and positive ads, broadly defined, in their ability to win votes or affect turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, specific types of negative and positive advertising do have distinct consequences. Spots that stir up positive emotions such as hope, pride and enthusiasm stimulate voters' interest and participation in an election. They also polarize the electorate by activating the partisanship of supporters and opponents who see the ads. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan's &quot;Morning in America&quot; ads featured uplifting music and bright images of happy workers, American flags and weddings. They established a standard for feel-good advertising that candidates of both parties have copied ever since. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ads that trigger fear are better at persuading voters because they loosen the grip of partisanship. They scare voters into paying attention to new information about the candidates and issues, making them more likely to change their minds. President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 &quot;Daisy&quot; ad, for example, dramatically raised the specter of a nuclear conflict at the Cold War's height. More recent ads have used dark images and ominous voice-overs to stoke fear about crime, immigration, terrorism, health care and jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anger, by contrast, does little to change minds; instead, it mobilizes voters to fight for their convictions. Campaign ads arouse anger by suggesting that people have been unfairly hurt and then casting blame, such as a recent Mitt Romney spot (&quot;Where Did All the Money Go?&quot;) that tries to incite outrage at President Obama by saying that he misspent stimulus funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political ads are too multifaceted to be labeled simply as negative or positive - and to conclude that one type is superior to the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Campaign ads are uninformative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a minimum, ads boost candidates' name recognition, which helps offset an incumbent's inherent advantage. But they also teach voters a great deal about where candidates stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because they reach people who might not seek out news or information about the candidates, ads can narrow the gap between uninformed voters and political junkies. Over the past 40 years, while politicians have been flooding TV and radio with spots highlighting their policy positions, conventional news sources have devoted less and less coverage to substantive policy differences, instead focusing on political strategy and poll results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign ads are brief, one-sided and occasionally misleading. Nonetheless, they provide broad access to information that many voters would not otherwise get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Less-informed voters are more easily swayed by ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But aren't those uninformed voters also easy prey for the emotionally manipulative tactics that media consultants deploy? Not so much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We respond emotionally to things we care about. Political advertising arouses the strongest reactions in those who care and know the most about politics. In 2006, a Republican National Committee ad showed Osama bin Laden threatening Americans over the sounds of a ticking clock and a thumping heartbeat. Informed voters are more likely to respond emotionally and politically to this sort of ad, in part because they have the type of strong partisan convictions that are undermined by fear ads (or activated by feel-good ads). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ad's timing matters as much as its content. Spots criticizing an opponent tend to work differently early and late in campaigns. Before people have settled on a candidate, attack ads help them make up their minds. But these same ads depress turnout when seen later by voters who have already chosen which candidate to support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A candidate should respond to an attack ad with a counterattack on the same issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases, such a response may make sense; in others, it is precisely the wrong thing to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If an accusation cuts to the core of a candidate's strength - say, the 2004 &quot;swift boat&quot; ad assault on John Kerry's war service in Vietnam - then a strong rebuttal, preferably with evidence, might be warranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, however, these counterattacks pull candidates off their message. Research suggests that it's better to spend ad dollars highlighting issues that play to a candidate's strengths - such as those on which she has built a solid reputation or on which voters prefer her stance - rather than engaging an opponent on his issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, for example, should probably not devote many ads to the fight against terrorism, an issue on which Obama fares relatively well in polling, or to the environment, a subject where Democrats have a reputational advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, airing ads denying that you are a witch, as Christine O'Donnell did in her failed 2010 Senate bid, feeds a campaign theme that is unlikely to improve your odds on Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. News organizations neutralize misleading ads by fact-checking them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such news stories may be well-intentioned, but there is no clear evidence that they reliably undercut misleading claims or manipulative tactics. Part of this may be because of volume; ads are repeated and reach many people who don't watch, listen to or read the news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter psychology also plays a role. While some news stories may weaken an ad's effectiveness, many media reports end up extending the reach of the misleading statements they are trying to debunk: People hear the claim and remember it better than the journalist's correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, CNN ran &quot;ad watch&quot; segments pointing out that Bill Clinton's attacks on President George H.W. Bush's handling of the economy were misleading and that Bush's attacks on Clinton for raising taxes as governor were hypocritical. In both cases, viewers came away with more favorable views of the candidate whose ad was being criticized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This tendency is exacerbated by the audience's strong partisan convictions. Research shows that partisans tend to persist in believing inaccurate information, even after it is corrected, when that information makes their party look better or makes the other party look worse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- So long, Victory Column. Hello, Gdansk Shipyard?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next week, Mitt Romney will dive into a rite of passage for presidential candidates: the big trip overseas to burnish foreign policy credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Mr. Romney, the question is not whether he can duplicate the euphoria that greeted Barack Obama's foreign campaign swing in 2008. Even Mr. Romney's Republican backers acknowledge there is no way he can compete with the images of Mr. Obama before 200,000 cheering Germans at Berlin's Victory Column, or the well-timed endorsement by the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, of Mr. Obama's call for a timetable for withdrawal of American troops just as Mr. Obama arrived in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far more important, both political and foreign policy experts say, is whether Mr. Romney will be able to use the three-country trip to Britain, Israel and Poland to establish a solid foreign policy doctrine that distinguishes him in a meaningful way from the president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, one of the few real national security differences between Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama is on Afghanistan: even as public sentiment has turned sharply against the war, Mr. Romney has refused to explicitly commit to the 2014 date for a troop withdrawal supported by Mr. Obama and NATO leaders. Mr. Romney's aides say that while he supports the timetable in concept, withdrawals would still depend on how commanders see conditions on the ground. And unlike Mr. Obama, Mr. Romney has refused to back negotiations with the Taliban. Mr. Obama's 2008 trip began in Afghanistan, but Mr. Romney's itinerary does not call for a stop there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He ain't going to Afghanistan because he doesn't want to say that he'll slow down the troop withdrawal process,'' said Leslie H. Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney will be attending a fund-raiser in London. Then he will travel to Jerusalem, appealing to Jewish voters in the United States. In Warsaw and Gdansk, he will make a play for Catholic and Polish voters (a big constituency in Pennsylvania and Michigan), Republican political strategists say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Polish part is about the Catholic vote, and that vote is very important,'' said Ed Rollins, the veteran Republican campaign operative. ''Everyone that has won the majority of the Catholic vote has won the presidency.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney will appear with Lech Walesa in Gdansk, the site of the Solidarity leader's battles against the Soviet-backed government during the cold war, giving Mr. Romney a chance to highlight his other key foreign policy difference with Mr. Obama -- the relationship between the United States and Russia, which Mr. Romney has called America's biggest geopolitical foe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A big question in Gdansk is whether Mr. Romney will repeat his Russia comment. He was criticized for it by both Obama officials and the foreign policy establishment and even some of his own foreign policy advisers have privately criticized the remark. But at a time when Russia, back under the helm of the former K.G.B. chief Vladimir V. Putin, is increasingly criticized for continuing to aid the government of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, Mr. Romney may decide to reiterate his criticism of Mr. Obama's Russian policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This trip demonstrates Governor Romney's belief in the worth and necessity of standing with our allies and locking arms with our allies, and that indeed is the common theme binding the United Kingdom, Israel and Poland,'' said Lanhee Chen, the Romney campaign's policy director. ''Each of these nations shares our love of liberty as well as the fortitude to defend it. They're each pillars of liberty and have fought through periods where liberty was under siege.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign aides have been quick to point out the difference between Mr. Romney's itinerary and Mr. Obama's pre-election trip in 2008. Four years ago, Mr. Obama met with the President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and played basketball with American troops in Kandahar, then headed to Iraq for meetings with Mr. Maliki and Gen. David H. Petraeus. In Jordan, Mr. Obama rode shotgun in a car driven by King Abdullah, who, after a lengthy meeting, personally drove Mr. Obama to his waiting plane at the airport, a phalanx of security cars screaming behind them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Jerusalem, Sderot and Ramallah, Mr. Obama met with both Israeli and Palestinian officials, including President Mahmoud Abbas, before winning over the crowds in Berlin and a skeptical Chancellor Angela Merkel. In Paris, Nicolas Sarkozy was so effusive in his praise that it was called an endorsement by the French news media. At his final stop in Britain, Mr. Obama met with government officials and the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Obama had a different mission on his trip -- he was presenting himself as a rock star of change,'' one Romney aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''Mitt Romney is running at a time when things are tough for Americans. We're not selling the same product. The mood in 2008 was different, and the mission of their trip was different.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney is not going to Germany -- the timing for a meeting with Ms. Merkel did not work out, aides said. Nor is he going to anywhere else in the Middle East besides Israel. He will not meet with Mr. Abbas, but will meet with Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian prime minister, with whom, one aide said, Mr. Romney had ''an existing relationship.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Israel, Mr. Romney may be pressured to say more about what his policy would be toward any pre-emptive Israeli military action against Iran, as well as how a Romney administration would handle the civil war in neighboring Syria. Mr. Romney has said he favors helping arm the Syrian rebels, but he has stopped short of agreeing with some Republicans in Congress who have called for airstrikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney will try to use the trip to counter criticism that he does not have a real foreign policy, a charge that the Obama camp plans to aggressively pursue in coming days. Obama campaign aides were quick to post Twitter messages and a video clip earlier this week of Romney campaign adviser Tara Wall's inability -- or unwillingness -- to answer a question on MSNBC's ''Daily Rundown'' about specifics of Mr. Romney's Afghanistan strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm not going to get into the details of that,'' Ms. Wall said, before changing the subject to the economy. Within minutes, the clip was winging its way around the digital world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the trip bolsters Mr. Romney's foreign policy credentials may not matter much. ''People will say that Mr. Romney is there to establish some rapport with these international figures,'' said the presidential historian Robert Dallek. ''But it doesn't mean a darn thing, because if you become president, they'll have to take you seriously.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of weeks ago, Vice President Biden told the Hispanic advocacy group La Raza, &quot;Mitt Romney wants you to show your papers, but he won't show us his.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sentiment - that Romney is hiding his tax information while demanding that immigrants prove their status - has made its way into a Spanish-language ad, &quot;No Trust,&quot; from the Obama-backing super PAC Priorities USA Action and the Service Employees International Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our vote is based on trust, but Mitt Romney's not telling us everything,&quot; the narrator says. &quot;What is he hiding? He wants us to show him our papers. But he doesn't show us his. How can we trust Mitt Romney?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spanish-language ads from Priorities  have not gotten as much attention as the group's Rust Belt attacks on Romney's business record. But these ads are no less harsh - one recent Spanish-language  spot called Romney &quot;a person without feelings.&quot; Obama and his allies are spending far more on Spanish-language ads than Romney is.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative groups are gearing up to spend millions of dollars over the next three months on ads attacking President Obama's health-care law and Democrats who support it, but in many cases voters will have no way of knowing who paid for the barrage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads amount to the next wave of opposition to Obama's health-care plan, which was upheld by the Supreme Court last month as constitutional under the federal government's taxing authority. Some of the groups most active on the issue have received funding from health-care firms opposed to parts of the legislation.          The American Action Network (AAN), for example, is targeting House Democrats who voted for &quot;Obamacare&quot; with $1.2 million in digital ads, mailings and other efforts. As a tax-exempt &quot;social welfare&quot; organization, the group is not required to identify its funders to the public.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How far will they go to protect Obama's agenda?&quot; a narrator asks in one digital ad, which equates a trio of New York Democrats with the Three Stooges comedy troupe. &quot;Tell congressmen Bill Owens, Tim Bishop and Louise Slaughter to repeal the health care tax.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two donations to the group have emerged publicly from the health-care sector: $3 million in 2011 from insurance giant Aetna and $4.5 million in 2010 from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association (PhRMA), Washington's biggest drugmaker lobby. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aetna and PhRMA officials say their contributions were made in support of general policies, not political ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort underscores the secrecy that pervades many of the political ads inundating voters this year, particularly in a dozen crucial swing states that are likely to decide the presidential race between Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spending is part of a broader debate over whether companies and trade groups should be required to publicly reveal their funding sources, particularly in the wake of court rulings that have freed corporations to spend unlimited money on politics. Democrats, who are bearing the brunt of the attack ads by independent groups, failed in attempts last week to pass disclosure legislation aimed at forcing some nonprofits to reveal their donors.          &quot;So many of these ads are cloaked in secrecy,&quot; said Bruce F. Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, which lobbies corporations to disclose their political expenditures. &quot;In a democracy, the public needs to know who is providing the funding, who the players are, whether you have folks engaging in duplicity or hypocrisy. Are the companies saying one thing but doing the opposite secretly?&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some corporate political spending does spill into public view. In 2009, even as they publicly pledged support for elements of Obama's health-care reform efforts, a group of major health-care firms funneled $86 million to the Chamber of Commerce for attack ads and lobbying efforts against the legislation, according to leaked records and news reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since early 2010, candidates and outside groups have spent more than $235 million on negative ads about the law, according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks ad spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans for Prosperity (AFP), a conservative group that has strong ties to the billionaire brothers who run Koch Industries, carried out a $9 million campaign against the health-care law that ran through mid-July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's going to be a lot more,&quot; said AFP President Tim Phillips. &quot;We want to be sure the public gets a sense of how important this is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Very little is known about where AFP gets its funding, which Phillips said is expected to top $70 million for 2012. &quot;We don't comment on any amounts that any particular donors give,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another group running spots against the health law is a new organization called American Commitment, founded last spring by Phil Kerpen, a longtime conservative activist who recently left AFP. The group has run more than $4 million in ads in the past month. Kerpen, who declined to identify the group's funders, said earlier this month: &quot;We're going to spend as much as we can raise.&quot;Concerned Women for America, a Christian conservative group that usually focuses on social issues such as abortion, also leaped into the health-care fray last month, with a  $6 million ad buy in six states alleging that women would be denied care under the law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was something that people were talking about that we wanted to take a stand on,&quot; said spokeswoman Alice Stewart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few groups on the left have been running ads in favor of the law. But Jesse Ferguson, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, predicts that many of the party's House candidates will champion the legislation as part of their campaigns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The more special-interest groups funded by health-insurance company profits choose to campaign against health insurance reforms, the more voters know those patient protections are important for the middle class and seniors,&quot; Ferguson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another ad campaign announced last week, the U.S. Chamber bought $1.1 million in airtime attacking Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-Nev.), a candidate for Senate, in part for backing health-care reform. The trade organization has strong backing from health-care firms, including $4.05 million from Aetna in 2011, according to documents revealed earlier this year by a trade publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aetna spokeswoman Cynthia B. Michener said the company's donations in 2011 to the Chamber and AAN were intended to spur debate on economic issues, not health care. She said the company has not made similar donations this year &quot;due to the intensity of the political cycle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The donations we made in 2011 helped fund educational programs focused on our economy,&quot; Michener said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PhRMA's tax records show that it gave more than $9 million to conservative advocacy groups in 2010 that actively opposed Obama's health-care reforms, including the payment to AAN. The funding came after PhRMA had agreed to publicly support the legislation in 2009 in exchange for limits on the financial impact to the drug industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior vice president Matthew Bennett said in a statement that the group &quot;contributes to organizations that share PhRMA's goals of improving the quality of patients' lives&quot; and supporting new medical treatments and research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             AAN spokesman Dan Conston said the health-care law is &quot;one of a number of key issues we intend to focus on this cycle.&quot; In addition to its digital ad campaign, the group co-hosted a conference on the health law earlier this month with Crossroads GPS, a conservative nonprofit that has spent more than $18 million on ads opposing the law since 2010, according to the CMAG data.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conston declined to say how much backing AAN has received from the health-care industry. &quot;We really do not comment on donors,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of weeks ago, Vice President Biden told the Hispanic advocacy group La Raza, &quot;Mitt Romney wants you to show your papers, but he won't show us his.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sentiment - that Romney is hiding his tax information while demanding that immigrants prove their status - has made its way into a Spanish-language ad, &quot;No Trust,&quot; from the Obama-backing super PAC Priorities USA Action and the Service Employees International Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our vote is based on trust, but Mitt Romney's not telling us everything,&quot; the narrator says. &quot;What is he hiding? He wants us to show him our papers. But he doesn't show us his. How can we trust Mitt Romney?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spanish-language ads from Priorities  have not gotten as much attention as the group's Rust Belt attacks on Romney's business record. But these ads are no less harsh - one recent Spanish-language  spot called Romney &quot;a person without feelings.&quot; Obama and his allies are spending far more on Spanish-language ads than Romney is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No Trust&quot; will run in Colorado, Nevada and Florida.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative groups are gearing up to spend millions of dollars over the next three months on ads attacking President Obama's health-care law and Democrats who support it, but in many cases voters will have no way of knowing who paid for the barrage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads amount to the next wave of opposition to Obama's health-care plan, which was upheld by the Supreme Courtlast month as constitutional under the federal government's taxing authority. Some of the groups most active on the issue have received funding from health-care firms opposed to parts of the legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Action Network (AAN), for example, is targeting House Democrats who voted for &quot;Obamacare&quot; with $1.2 million in digital ads, mailings and other efforts. As a tax-exempt &quot;social welfare&quot; organization, the group is not required to identify its funders to the public. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How far will they go to protect Obama's agenda?&quot; a narrator asks in one digital ad, which equates a trio of New York Democrats with the Three Stooges comedy troupe. &quot;Tell congressmen Bill Owens, Tim Bishop and Louise Slaughter to repeal the health care tax.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two donations to the group have emerged publicly from the health-care sector: $3 million in 2011 from insurance giant Aetna and $4.5 million in 2010 from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association (PhRMA), Washington's biggest drugmaker lobby. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aetna and PhRMA officials say their contributions were made in support of general policies, not political ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort underscores the secrecy that pervades many of the political adsinundating voters this year, particularly in a dozen crucial swing states that are likely to decide the presidential race between Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DELRAY BEACH, Fla. -- Not far from the beach, Representative Allen B. West recited the Declaration of Independence at a sweltering Fourth of July fair, lobbing the sentences into the crowd and hoping the gravitas of the words would sink in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. West, a Republican positioned near the top of the Democrats' knockout list, is fond of letting words speak for themselves -- no parsing, no apologizing, no backtracking. In this era of survey-tested language, he is a verbal street brawler, unflinching in his speech, a trait that has won him the adulation (and the campaign contributions) of conservatives and Tea Party supporters who cheer on his every Westism. He is one of the top fund-raisers among House Republicans, rivaling Speaker John A. Boehner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''People are looking for leadership,'' said Mr. West, 51, a first-term congressman, in a brief interview as supporters posed for photographs and exchanged a few words. ''Principles, pragmatism, passion and leadership: It's obvious we are representing those values.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite his celebrity and prodigious fund-raising, Mr. West, who announced he would run in a new district this year, faces a serious challenge in November. The question for Democrats is this: Will Mr. West's conservative stance and unbridled style pass muster with a new set of Florida voters in a swing district that is evenly split? In that race, Mr. West is likely to face Patrick Murphy, 30, a Democrat and political neophyte who is shaping up to be a potent force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats are banking that in a presidential election year, Mr. West will fail to sway enough independent-minded voters to win in November. They view the newly created 18th Congressional District on the Treasure Coast as one of six possible Democratic gains in Florida. Impressed with Mr. Murphy's fund-raising, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has put its financial and organizational strength behind him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aubrey Jewett, a political science professor at the University of Central Florida, said the race would hinge largely on turnout. At the moment, President Obama and Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, are neck-and-neck in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Mr. West's penchant for controversy and his conservative voting record, it is too early to gauge its impact on the race. But he runs the risk of turning off at least some potential voters at a time when the Tea Party's influence in Florida has encountered a backlash, said Kevin Wagner, a political science professor at Florida Atlantic University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Jewett said, ''The danger for West is appearing that he is more interested in headlines and bombast and not as interested in representing voters in the district in a solid conventional way.'' He added: ''When he won two years ago, he seemed like a breath of fresh air to a lot of the voters down there who were anxious to send a message that they were dissatisfied with President Obama. Now that he has been in office for two years, his act may be wearing a little thin.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates face primary opponents but are expected to win the races handily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, Mr. West learned that with a squiggle here and a slash there, his original Congressional district in Broward and Palm Beach Counties had become far less hospitable to conservative Republicans. He jumped a step north, declaring he would run in a new swing district encompassing St. Lucie County, Martin County and a slice of northern Palm Beach County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Murphy, who was intent on defeating Mr. West, also shuffled north and rechallenged him. The newly drawn 18th Congressional District voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and for Alex Sink, the Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for governor, in 2010. In 2004, George W. Bush won with 51 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign handicappers have said that Mr. West is trying to modulate his tone; his first campaign ad, while staying true to his views, is sedate by his standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. West, who is fond of holding town hall meetings, said that while he is plunging into local issues, his principles are unshaken and portable. ''Why would you change your principles?'' he said. ''They fit in no matter where.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Paterson, the chairman of the Republican Party in St. Lucie County, where there are more Democrats than Republicans, said Mr. West would have little trouble hooking Republicans in that county. Mr. West, a retired Army officer, has a conservative voting record but has sometimes broken from the party line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''So many people want a breath of fresh air,'' Mr. Paterson said. ''He is going to tell you the truth, whether you like it or not. His message doesn't change based on the group he is talking to.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his whirlwind first term as a congressman and one of only two black Republicans in the House, Mr. West has said flat-out that as many as 80 House Democrats are Communists. He has remarked that the Democratic Party would do the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proud with its use of ''lies and deceits.'' He has called people with Obama bumper stickers a ''threat to the gene pool.'' Recently, he said that President Obama wants Americans ''to be his slave and be economically dependent on him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, on Fox News, he said the rise in the number of people on Social Security disability since 2009 merely stokes economic dependency, ''which, to me, is a form of modern, 21st-century slavery.'' Mindful that Mr. West's new district is teeming with retirees, Democrats delighted in hearing the words ''Social Security'' and ''slavery'' in the same sentence and quickly publicized it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His words, no matter how raw, steer donations his way from around the country. He raised $2.2 million for the quarter, one of the highest tallies in the country, and has $3.7 million on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This election cycle, he has raised nearly $10 million, a huge number for the House. Mr. Murphy raised more than $500,000 this quarter and $2.2 million so far this election cycle; he has nearly $1.3 million on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the race, Mr. West's campaign has described Mr. Murphy as a cookie-cutter Democrat with little experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''At this point in time, Murphy is running a negative campaign to raise liberal money,'' said Tim Edson, Mr. West's campaign manager. ''No issues. No substance. Just negative attacks.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true that Mr. Murphy has tapped into voters who strongly dislike Mr. West. An accountant who graduated from the University of Miami, Mr. Murphy is vice president of Coastal Environmental Services, which specializes in disaster relief and environmental cleanup, including the BP oil spill.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There are people saying, 'I don't care who you are, but you are better than Allen West,' '' he said. ''It's truly a moderate district.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Murphy, a Florida native, said he decided to challenge Mr. West because he was angry about the partisan gridlock in Washington. Mr. West, he said, epitomizes the bottleneck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's about getting something done,'' said Mr. Murphy, who calls himself progressive on social issues and more moderate on fiscal issues. ''The first thing I want to do when I get to Congress is have dinner with a Republican.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were envisioned as low-key, across-the-pond fund-raisers that would allow Mitt Romney to extract campaign cash from expatriates in London by night as he played statesman by day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the two receptions that Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, will hold for donors next week during a swing through Europe are turning into an ill-timed public relations headache for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several of the events' hosts are top executives at banks tied to the interest rate-fixing scandal that is now engulfing London's financial and political world, linking Mr. Romney, however superficially, to a messy moment in the continuing debate over Wall Street excesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British and American authorities are examining the role of more than 10 banks in the possible manipulation of key interest rates that affected how consumers and companies borrowed money around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former chief executive and a top lobbyist for Barclays, the bank at the center of the scandal, helped organize a Romney fund-raiser. The former chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., has since withdrawn his name as the event's co-host. The bank's lobbyist, Patrick J. Durkin, remains a co-chairman: he has bundled $1.1 million for Mr. Romney from friends and business associates, more than any other lobbyist, according to federal records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late June, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to resolve accusations that it had tried to manipulate rates to benefit its bottom line. Shortly after, Mr. Diamond resigned from his position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign of just how politicized the scandal has become, 11 members of Parliament recently signed a resolution, naming Mr. Romney, that called for Barclays executives to ''cease fund-raising for political candidates'' and focus on rebuilding consumer confidence in the banking system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soliciting donations abroad, as exotic as it sounds, is by no means new. Election laws permit candidates to accept contributions from citizens living outside the United States, and John McCain and Barack Obama did so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barclays was the ninth-biggest source of contributions to Mr. Romney's campaign either directly or through his joint fund-raising effort with the Republican National Committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, with employees contributing $234,650 through the end of May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democrats may be loath to draw attention to Mr. Romney's donations from big banks like Barclays. Employees of the bank have contributed $34,800 to Mr. Obama and his joint effort with the Democratic National Committee. (Mr. Obama does not allow registered lobbyists to bundle for his campaign.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. attended a fund-raiser in Park City, Utah, co-hosted by Mark Gilbert, a top executive at Barclays, who has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Mr. Obama's re-election bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of the Romney and Obama campaigns declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides Barclays, executives at several banks under investigation, including HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, are co-chairmen for the Romney fund-raisers in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney appeared to take all the normal precautions for his events in London: an invitation to one of the fund-raisers reminds guests that they ''must provide copy of U.S. Passport.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, any ties to the firms under investigation could detract from a trip intended to highlight Mr. Romney's history with the Olympics. Mr. Romney, who ran the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, plans to attend the opening ceremonies for the 2012 Games next Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is more, it may give ammunition to his left-wing critics, since Mr. Romney has railed against Wall Street regulation, like the Dodd-Frank Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the controversy, the co-host of one fund-raiser, Karl Dasher, said there was ''strong excitement'' for Romney among expatriates in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican fund-raisers described the London receptions as a case of awkward timing, noting that scrutiny of presidential donors always intensifies when a company is under investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You want to make sure that you don't wind up with egg on your face because you got some money from some guy who pulled a stunt. But you can't screen everybody that writes your check,'' said Alfred Hoffman Jr., a Florida developer who is a top Republican fund-raiser but is not raising money for the Romney campaign. ''You do the best you can -- you make sure that they're an American citizen.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. PAUL, Va. -- Like so many others in Appalachia, Amelia Trent's vote is tied to coal, and when it comes to the coal industry and her economic future, Ms. Trent does not trust President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Obama is scary. He's a Muslim,'' Ms. Trent said matter-of-factly, but incorrectly, outside the small law firm here where she works as a secretary. On the other hand, she said she could never vote for Mitt Romney. ''He doesn't know what poor is -- or the struggling middle class, which is what we are around here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ms. Trent, 59, knows and likes former Gov. Tim Kaine, the Democrat contending for the seat of Senator Jim Webb, a fellow Democrat who is retiring. She said she would vote for him over former Senator George Allen, a Republican trying to win his seat back in a neck-and-neck race that could decide which party controls the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of more than a dozen competitive Senate races this year, none appear as close as the contest in Virginia. For both Mr. Kaine and Mr. Allen, the search for people like Ms. Trent who say their vote for senator is not tied to their vote for president has become imperative. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state appears deadlocked between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday had the presidential candidates even at 44 percent support in the state, a situation consistent with recent national polls. (The poll also showed the Senate race tied.) And neither Senate candidate wants his fate dependent on his party's presidential standard-bearer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this hunt for voters, however, Mr. Kaine sees an edge, if only a small one. He was Mr. Obama's handpicked Democratic National Committee chairman, and he has made no real effort to distance himself from the president. Last weekend, he stood side by side with Mr. Obama as the president barnstormed Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Mr. Kaine portrays himself as a bipartisan problem solver in the mold of Virginia's other senator, Mark Warner, another Democrat who courted both parties while serving as governor. Mr. Kaine has tried to appeal to swing voters in the Washington suburbs, including moderate Republicans, with his record on transportation issues in the region. And his time as a moderate mayor of Richmond could still appeal to some Republicans there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His language is carefully chosen. At a roundtable discussion in Bristol, hard on the Tennessee border, Mr. Kaine told attendees from both parties: ''I'll make this promise to you: If I'm elected, I will be a partner with the president, whoever it is.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Allen, by contrast, has made Mr. Obama -- and Mr. Kaine's close connection to him -- Issue No. 1. In recent advertisements, including one first shown last week, Mr. Allen has sought a bipartisan sheen, but his record has a harder edge than his opponent's, including his famous pledge at the 1994 state Republican convention to knock Virginia Democrats' ''soft teeth down their whiny throats.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether she could envision someone who would vote for Mr. Romney and also for Mr. Kaine, Nancy Steele, a Republican bed-and-breakfast manager who attended Mr. Kaine's Bristol meeting, paused and then said no. Asked if she could see an Obama-Allen voter, she laughed and said, ''Never!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Kaine said he thought he could appeal to those who vote for Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There will be thousands of Romney-Kaine voters,'' Mr. Kaine said over a milkshake in Bristol. ''Whether it will be 2,000 or 50,000, I don't know.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaine campaign aides say the mother lode of Romney-Kaine voters is not in the less populated country roads of southwestern Virginia but in the suburbs of Washington and Richmond. There, some voters may see Mr. Kaine and Mr. Romney as pro-business technocrats -- and Mr. Allen and Mr. Obama as partisan flag carriers for their parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Kaine is searching for them across this diverse state. The trip to Bristol last week was his third. He has also been to the conservative southwestern towns of Castlewood, Wise and Blacksburg, and he is planning another trip this month, to a health clinic at the Wise County Fairgrounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one expects the Democrat to win this area, but he cannot afford to be blown out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's some tough real estate in this state,'' Mr. Kaine said, ''and this is some tough real estate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Allen campaign believes that Mr. Kaine is facing a rout in coal country, where many white working-class voters are suspicious of Mr. Obama's intentions for coal. To distance himself from the president, Mr. Kaine would have to offer vocal opposition of the sort that Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, displayed in an advertisement that showed him firing a rifle at an Obama energy bill, said Chris LaCivita, a longtime Virginia Republican campaign adviser. But that will not happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Politics and campaigns aren't waged in a vacuum, and Tim Kaine has two years as chairman of the D.N.C., where he was the coal killer's biggest cheerleader,'' Mr. LaCivita said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kaine's approach is to mix his pitch for bipartisanship with localized boasts about his record as governor, a record that he hopes will differentiate him from the president. A key to that record is the looming Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center, a state-of-the-art 585-megawatt coal-fired power plant on the outskirts of St. Paul that started commercial operations on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kaine mentions the plant virtually everywhere he goes as an antidote to efforts to link him to Obama administration policies that have been tough on coal. He does not pander. In Bristol on Friday, he said that human activity was warming the planet, and that the country needed to transition to cleaner sources of energy. But he also said he helped make the huge coal plant in the mountains above Bristol happen as governor. The plant is proof, he said, that coal and clean-air regulations can coexist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''My advice is, don't try to weaken regulations,'' he told voters in southwestern Virginia last week. ''Sell your story. Say we can meet these standards.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is not much evidence that such nuance will break through the hostility that regulations under Mr. Obama have engendered here. Talk of an Obama ''war on coal'' saturates the airwaves, and in an area already down on its luck, such talk breeds fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's probably coal that keeps everything going,'' said Betty McMillan, 73. ''If that goes, it all goes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In more than a dozen interviews in St. Paul, no one was familiar with any role that Mr. Kaine had in getting the plant going. As recently as March, the former governor toured the plant in a campaign swing. It did not seem to make an impression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I did the permitting, and I don't remember that,'' Jeff Kite, 44, an environmental engineer, said about Mr. Kaine's role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kite said that regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency had kept him gainfully employed, because businesses hire him to help them comply with federal standards. But, he said, they are ''just killing permitting.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's no coal mining, no new transportation. He's really hurt the economy,'' Mr. Kite said of the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hank Banner, 43, a Democrat who is the baseball coach at the University of Virginia's College at Wise, sat with Mr. Kite, waiting for lunch at Giovanni's Pizza, one of the few restaurants still open on St. Paul's quiet main street. Mr. Obama will not win Virginia, Mr. Banner said, shaking his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Folks he got in '08 he's not going to get this time,'' he said. But, he was quick to add, Mr. Kaine could win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Democrats in Bristol, word that not even the residents of St. Paul knew of Mr. Kaine's role in the giant plant elicited concern. Energy produced in Virginia is a mainstay of Mr. Allen's campaign, and his drumbeat on the issue appears to be taking root among voters. At Mr. Kaine's Bristol roundtable discussion, he was peppered with pointed questions about drilling off the Virginia coast, natural gas exploration and coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Are you in complete alignment with President Obama, who said he wanted to go on and bankrupt the coal industry?'' Ken Kistner, 77, asked with real bite, not backing off when Mr. Kaine said he had never heard that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That led to Mr. Kaine's embracing steps against climate change, talking up clean energy and describing his role in starting the plant outside St. Paul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Told no one in the town knew of that role, Jerry Mathews, 76, a Democrat at the Bristol event, said with a sigh, ''That's a problem.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Bruce, 65, a retired pharmaceutical representative, said, ''He probably needs to pound his chest a bit more.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- While hiking the Appalachian Trail the other day, I became part of a Republican campaign attack on President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Save the Mark Sanford jokes; I was (really) chaperoning a church youth group. Only after returning did I learn that my prevacation reporting about second-quarter job growth on CNBC had led off a television ad assailing Mr. Obama's economic record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was merely a three-second factual observation -- ''The worst job-adding quarter in two years'' -- and not especially elegant at that. Yet beginning on July 11, it was shown 6,136 times over six days in media markets from Denver to Tampa, according to Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More and more this election year, campaign ads include footage from television news programs, further blurring the fading lines separating modern journalism and politics. The trend bothers practitioners of journalism more than those in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I thought you were particularly photogenic that day,'' chuckled Karl Rove, a founder of Crossroads GPS, the Republican group that produced the ad featuring my work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But of course that was not the reason Crossroads used the CNBC footage. They wanted to borrow a bit of credibility from the same ''mainstream media'' that they choose at other moments to bash as biased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When people see political ads, they think someone's lying to them,'' said Mark McKinnon, an ad maker who worked with Mr. Rove on both of George W. Bush's winning presidential campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We try really hard to get credible third-party messengers to deliver facts,'' Mr. McKinnon explained. ''A fact coming from you is much more believable than a fact coming from us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As flattering as that might sound to journalists, our own credibility is hardly setting industry records right now. Which is precisely why journalists worry about the additional baggage of becoming associated with campaign advocacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I don't like it,'' said Tom Brokaw, for years the anchor of ''NBC Nightly News.'' ''It's so hard to stay in what I call the 'umpire mode.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney did not help him with an ad during Florida's Republican primary race this year. Fighting to fend off Newt Gingrich, the Romney campaign broadcast an ad consisting solely of Mr. Brokaw's ''Nightly News'' report on a 1997 House ethics vote against Mr. Gingrich, then House speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brokaw and NBC News worried that the ad ''compromised'' his role as a journalist and asked that it be stopped. As they expected, the request was ignored; by Kantar Media's count, the ad ran 2,225 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once campaigns feared complaints from prominent TV journalists -- and the hassle of responding to the lawyers who spoke for them. Now ad makers from both parties shrug them off, as the prevalence of the practice increases their confidence that ''fair use'' broadcasting rules make legal threats toothless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I understand why Tom was angry,'' said Bill Carrick, a veteran Democratic news media consultant. But, he added, ''that's a lost battle.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been lost for several reasons, including the erosion of trust in politicians and the explosion of political talk on cable television. The expanded supply of available material ricochets rapidly among partisans via Twitter, Facebook and other social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's very easy'' to build an attack ad around TV news footage,'' Mr. Carrick said. ''You can put it together in a half-hour.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A campaign like this one, centered on economic conditions, only increases the incentives to use TV talking heads as shortcuts. Personal scandals are easier to exploit in 30 seconds than international debt crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Illustrating the problems facing the American economy is very difficult to do,'' said Elizabeth Wilner, a former political director at NBC News who is now a vice president at Kantar and a columnist for Advertising Age. Using TV journalists ''provides compelling, credible footage to back up the ads' arguments.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the ad featuring Mr. Brokaw shows, the technique is more broadly useful than that. Mr. Romney's campaign rolled out an ad featuring TV footage of David Brooks of The New York Times, Mark Halperin of Time magazine and Bob Schieffer of CBS News discussing the negative tone of Mr. Obama's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This was done without our permission,'' Mr. Schieffer complained on ''Face the Nation,'' the Sunday talk show he hosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am less concerned, perhaps because my Crossroads speaking part is so brief and noncontroversial. As a grade school student in 1968, long before CNBC existed, I appeared in a campaign ad that today would set off far greater blowback. It was an ad for Robert F. Kennedy, whose campaign my father, Richard Harwood, was then covering for The Washington Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stakes are also much higher for the likes of Mr. Schieffer and Mr. Brokaw, since I am the TV news equivalent of a Miami Heat bench warmer to their LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. The major networks invest heavily in their superstar anchors, who as a result are especially sensitive to anything that could threaten their reputations and appeal to viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they also know they had better get used to it. ''I'm afraid we are just caught now in this world,'' said Mr. Brokaw, now semiretired, from his home in Montana. ''All the gates are down, and it's not comfortable.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Follow the Muzak. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Silverman makes a remarkable catch. He asks why the Romney counter-attack on the &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; ad featured Obama singing Al Green, and pretty well too. Well, it turns out that this is how the other .01% think:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the better answers I have found comes from a well-known supporter of Mr Romney - Suzy Welch, former editor in chief of the Harvard Business Review, and wife of Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric. In an appearance on CNN with her husband, Mrs Welch suggested that Mr Obama's personal style and choice of musical material define him as a member of a &quot;different America&quot;. I would imagine this is why Mr Romney's campaign included the snippet of Mr Obama singing &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot; at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. They hoped it would convey his otherness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the difference between the songs that they're singing,&quot; Mrs Welch said. &quot;Mitt Romney didn't exactly do a beautiful job on that song, but think about what he's singing, OK? I mean it's that patriotic song and he goes all the way through it. Then you've got the very cool Barack Obama singing Al Green. That is the two different Americas. Isn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How &quot;other&quot; is Al Green? So other, so alien, that, well, he's included on the Muzak they play in Red Lobster restaurants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somebody is alien and out of touch with America here, that's for sure. But I don't think it's the president.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The 2012 presidential campaign has become a battlefield of mocking, rhetorical missiles, many of them delivered in the form of cheap, quickly produced videos. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're a talented video producer with a tendency toward scathing, sarcastic attacks, this appears to be your year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2012 presidential campaign has become a battlefield of mocking, rhetorical missiles, many of them delivered in the form of cheap, quickly produced videos posted to the Internet and publicized by the campaigns on Twitter and Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But do they go too far, risking a backlash even as they go viral?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's campaign and his Democratic allies are testing that thesis with a series of videos and TV ads that have made fun of Mitt Romney's off-key singing, his awkward lapses into corporate-speak and even his wife's beloved dancing Olympic horse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That last one has already blown up in their faces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In two videos produced by the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Romney's words were juxtaposed with images of Ann Romney's horse, Rafalca, performing the Olympic sport of dressage, or horse ballet, with a top-hatted man in the saddle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do we really want a president who dances around the issues?&quot; asks the video - which has been viewed 61,440 times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's supporters clearly thought the video was funny. Mrs. Romney apparently thought otherwise. And it turns out that mocking the very serious hobby of a candidate's wife - especially one who is extremely popular - is not a particularly good strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic National Committee quickly apologized, saying that the &quot;use of the Romneys' dressage horse was not meant to offend Mrs. Romney in any way, and we regret it if it did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the committee should have listened to Mr. Obama's own advice, delivered earlier this year after a Democratic strategist criticized Mrs. Romney as never having worked a day in her life. In a television interview soon after, Mr. Obama suggested staying away from spouses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I haven't met Mrs. Romney, but she seems like a very nice woman who is supportive of her family and supportive of her husband. I don't know if she necessarily volunteered for this job so, you know, we don't need to be directing comments at them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Democrats are backing away from the horse images, they are by no means abandoning the posting of biting videos to drive home their message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a video released by Mr. Obama this week, a handful of people can be seen reading a transcript of Mr. Romney's answer to questions about when he left Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded two decades ago. The voters trip over his awkward phrasing, making the video seem more like a segment on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; than a campaign ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He says 'entity' a lot,&quot; one person says, looking a bit confused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign also produced a television ad shown in nine battleground states that shows Mr. Romney singing &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; -- badly. The idea was to contrast the song with images of the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, where Mr. Romney reportedly kept money in offshore accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior advisers to Mr. Obama said they believed the ad did not go too far. They said they were confident that voters would see it as a lighthearted way to make a point about Mr. Romney's finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign disagreed, and quickly issued a statement accusing Mr. Obama of making fun of a great American song. &quot;It is sad and shameful that President Obama would mock 'America The Beautiful,'&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of sarcastic videos is not limited to Mr. Obama's campaign. Mr. Romney and his Republican allies have produced their fair share of attacks intended to become sensations on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One recent video by the Republican National Committee shows Jay Carney, Mr. Obama's press secretary, saying that the president has &quot;a lot on his plate.&quot; The video then goes on to show that Mr. Obama has golfed 10 times and held 106 fund-raisers in the last six months, while his jobs council has not met once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video then shows a fancy-looking dinner plate with $100 bills and golf balls on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another golf-themed video (lest people forget that Mr. Obama plays a lot of golf), the Republican National Committee shows a golfer repeatedly missing the final put, while showing headlines about Mr. Obama's economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first election to feature snarky videos. In 1988, video of Michael Dukakis wearing a helmet as he rode in a tank came to epitomize his awkwardness. And in 2004, an ad of John Kerry windsurfing was used by Republicans as a metaphor for his flip-flopping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it does seem as if a cadre of Democratic and Republican video producers have been busy for months creating a mountain of these attack videos, just waiting for the moment to unload them on the voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That moment seems to be now.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tragedy collided with an unpleasant side of election-year politics on Friday, prompting the suspension of negative advertising in one of the country's most hotly contested battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama and Mitt Romney both said Friday that they were suspending advertising in Colorado in light of the shootingthere that claimed at least 12 lives and injured dozens more. Two major &quot;super PACs&quot; also said they would cease advertising for now, an acknowledgement&nbsp;that to continue pointed political attacks at this time would be distasteful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are pulling all ads in Colorado until further notice,&quot; said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney. An Obama campaign official confirmed that the president's negative ads were being dropped.Since all of Mr. Obama's&nbsp;commercials running in Colorado this week have targeted Mr. Romney, it appeared the campaign was indeed suspending all its television advertising there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Crossroads and its sister organization, Crossroads GPS, which have spent millions of dollars attacking Mr. Obama in Colorado and were preparing to begin a fresh round of advertising on Friday, confirmed that its ads were being dropped as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In moments of tragedy like the Aurora shooting, we all stand together as Americans,&quot; said Steven Law, the group's president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A super PAC supporting the president, Priorities Action USA, also said its ads were suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado is one of the handful of battleground states where a fierce advertising war is playing out. Lately, most of those ads have been attack ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's campaign had been airing three searing attacks on Mr. Romney in Colorado. One mocked Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, showing him singing &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; as headlines about his holdings in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands flashed on the screen. Another cited Mr. Romney's opposition to abortion. And a third says his economic plan would raise taxes on 18 million working families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two English-language ads Mr. Romney has been running in Colorado accuse Mr. Obama of showering his friends and campaign contributorswith federal stimulus dollars and of lyingabout Mr. Romney's business record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">663 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Mitt Romney's most prolific fundraisers are two dozen current and former employees of Bain Capital and its parent firm who have helped raise at least $4.5 million to help their former colleague defeat President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign has not disclosed the 26 current and former Bain employees as &quot;bundlers,&quot; but USA TODAY has identified them through invitations to fundraisers where they served on the host committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has released his list of bundlers, leading to a coordinated attack by Romney allies this week accusing the president of &quot;political payoffs&quot; in the form of federal grants and loans to his fundraisers. One bundler cited was California investor Steve Westly, whose company's holdings include a firm that receive money for an Energy Department program. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has not released his own list of bundlers, so USA TODAY has compiled its own list of more than 1,200 from Romney news releases, lobbyist disclosures, fundraiser invitations and other news accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of Romney's Bain bundlers are former partners at Bain Capital, the Boston-based private equity firm that Romney says he left in 1999. But the list also includes two current managing directors whose tenure overlapped with Romney's: Steven Barnes and his wife have contributed $151,600 to various committees supporting Romney, and Stephen Zide and his wife have contributed $655,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zide is on the board of Sensata Technologies, and owns at least a 10% share in the company, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sensata is the former sensors and controls division of Texas Instruments bought by Bain in 2006 for $3 billion. Now, it's laying off 170 employees at its Freeport, Ill., plant and moving the jobs to China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the Freeport City Council called on Romney to visit the town and ask his former company to save American jobs. &quot;He's still getting plenty of income from his investments at Bain. This is a company he created,&quot; said Cheryl Randecker, a Sensata employee who said she's been training her Chinese replacements. &quot;Romney talks about creating American jobs. We don't have to create them if we would just leave them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zide's secretary referred questions to Bain Capital spokesman Alex Stanton, who said he would not comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, too, has taken $118,121 in campaign contributions from employees of Bain Capital and parent Bain &amp; Co. since 2004, according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- something the Romney campaign says demonstrates the &quot;height of hypocrisy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama has based his entire re-election campaign on a vicious, dishonest assault on Mitt Romney's business career,&quot; campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said. &quot;The real question for President Obama is this: If Bain Capital is so bad, why have you taken nearly $120,000 in donations from them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Romney bundlers with Bain connections include Dick Boyce, who also gave $300,000 to Restore Our Future super PAC, and Edward Conard, who gave $1 million to the Romney-affiliated super PAC last year through a phantom company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The value of these bundlers is also in the contributions they bring in from others. Since Romney doesn't disclose his bundlers, there's no way of knowing the exact amount raised, but many Romney events have minimum fundraising amounts for co-hosts, totaling at least $835,000 for the Bain bundlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, Boyce and six other current and former Bain partners -- private equity investors Jennifer Fonstad, Eric Ragatz, Jesse Rogers and Jared Stone, Bain San Jose office head Tom Holland and Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman -- hosted a May 30 fundraiser at Chateau Carolands in Hillsborough, Calif. Each host brought in at least $50,000 in contributions, according to a campaign fundraising invitation that specified the amount of money each host needed to bring in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boyce, now partner of TPG Capital, did not return a call seeking comment. He's rarely spoken publicly of his relationship with Romney.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has repeatedly embraced three titans of American commerce, General Electric, Boeing and JPMorgan Chase, showering their chief executives with praise and adopting policies that benefit the companies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His economic stimulus package awarded $200 million in contracts to GE, according to the company, and he has traveled the world selling Boeing airplanes - even joking that he should receive a gold watch for how many he has sold. Obama rejected calls from some economists to break up the biggest banks after the financial crisis, leaving JPMorgan, the biggest of them all, whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet these companies - from corporate suites to the rank and file - have shown little enthusiasm for the president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top executives have repeatedly criticized his rhetoric and his policies or have declined to support some of his most significant proposals. Employees, in a contrast to 2008, have scaled back financial support for Obama's campaign.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's relationship with GE, Boeing and JPMorgan offers a window into his sometimes-strained dealings with corporate America. He has for 31 / 2 years tried to nurture better connections to business, inviting top executives into his inner circle, promoting manufacturing and exports, and pumping money into a weak economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he hasn't always received a positive reception, with executives complaining about his tone and his policies. That may create difficulties for Obama as he runs for reelection against Republican Mitt Romney, who says business experience is one of his chief credentials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's dwindling support among some in business is evidenced in campaign giving. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although employees of GE, Boeing and JPMorgan backed Obama and other Democratic candidates by wide margins in 2008, that backing has declined this year. GE and JPMorgan employees have switched their allegiance to Romney and his fellow Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, while Boeing employees continue to support the president, albeit by a smaller advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William M. Daley, who was serving as a senior JPMorgan executive and was a Boeing director when Obama tapped him in 2011 to be his chief of staff, said business leaders have generally not understood that the president's job is to represent American workers, not just business interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people in business have misjudged the president's intentions,&quot; Daley said. &quot;They don't understand the difficulties the American people are having.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;A lot of people in the business community have historically been and are Republicans. That's a fact of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to their public statements and people close to them, the chief executives of JPMorgan, GE and Boeing bear no ill will toward the White House and have had plenty of access to administration officials to advocate their views on business policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has bothered them has been the White House's rhetoric, which they perceive as sometimes unfairly critical of business, and its support of regulations that they consider burdensome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JPMorgan head Jamie Dimon, a longtime Democrat, has spent millions of his company's dollars lobbying against several provisions of the Dodd-Frank overhaul of financial regulation, which is one of Obama's signature domestic achievements. He also has expressed exasperation with Democratic rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've gotten disturbed at some of the Democrats' anti-business behavior, the attacks on work ethic and successful people,&quot; Dimon said in May on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boeing chief executive W. James McNerney Jr. was outraged by efforts by the National Labor Relations Board to try to stop Boeing from creating a non-union plant in South Carolina. Although the NLRB was not controlled by Obama, he appointed the board official who filed the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As chairman of the Business Roundtable, a lobby that has often been critical of Obama, McNerney has expressed concerns in conference calls and interviews about the administration's approach to medical and environmental regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, he has said, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, which fall under Obama's purview, often have had an attitude of &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; in their oversight of companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A person close to the Boeing chief said that he considered some of the White House's rhetoric early on as unfairly critical of corporate America but that it has improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, in a recent interview with Bloomberg Television, McNerney said the president needs to show more &quot;sensitivity&quot; to the needs of business. &quot;I think there could be more of it. There is some and they're trying to reach out, but no, I'd like to see more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GE chief executive Jeffrey Immelt, who has the high-profile post of chairman of Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, a group composed largely of executives who advise Obama on job creation, has been more reticent. But a person who has talked with Immelt said he shares many of the same concerns.Although they have talked about business and the White House in the past, representatives of Immelt, McNerney and Dimon declined to comment for this article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's supporters say that his policies kept the economy out of a depression, and that big firms have earned robust profits during the recovery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think people are quick to forget how dire the situation was. We had our entire global financial system on the brink of disaster,&quot; said Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com and a campaign co-chairman. &quot;The president was part of the team that stabilized our global financial system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daley, who stepped down as chief of staff earlier this year, said the administration has worked hard to ensure that regulations make sense. But he was incredulous about the complaints regarding Obama's tone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a constant refrain: 'We don't like the rhetoric. Oh, my gosh, it's terrible,' &quot; Daley said. &quot;It's like, 'Hey, guys, politics is tough business.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, one of the two union leaders on the president's jobs council, said he has been dismayed by how top executives have responded to Obama's efforts to reach out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president, in good faith, thought these guys were some of the best and brightest titans out there. They'll come in and tell [him] about what they need to create jobs,&quot; he said. Instead, &quot;they were concerned about their niche rather than about the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trumka recalled a meeting of the council in Pittsburgh one morning in October, at a time when Obama was promoting a $450 billion package of measures to boost job growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union leader rose from his seat, looked at Immelt and said, &quot;The president has just put out a jobs bill. Don't you think one of the things we should do as his jobs council is look at that and adopt it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Trumka, Immelt replied: &quot;We think that's too political.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trumka recalled saying, &quot;Adopting the president's jobs bill is too political? What in it don't you agree with? Tell me what it is you don't agree with. What would be bad for jobs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation moved on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has benefited from the relationships he has had with executives. Having never worked in the private sector, he is able to show that he can rely on the expertise of some of the country's leading executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has used his close relationship with Warren Buffett, one of the nation's most prominent businessmen, to promote the White House's plan to increase taxes on the wealthy. (Buffett's Berkshire-Hathaway is the largest shareholder of The Washington Post Co.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also has been able to claim part of the credit - or at least share the stage - for major deals to sell U.S.-manufactured goods to foreign customers, supporting American jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GE has been a beneficiary of a number of Obama administration policies - namely efforts to nurture a domestic clean energy industry. GE manufactures many technologies used in clean energy, such as wind turbines. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immelt was welcomed into Obama's inner circle at the beginning of the term, and he has made it clear that he won't back any candidate in this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, overall, GE and its employees have moved from supporting Obama and the Democrats to Romney and the Republicans this year. In the 2008 cycle, GE employees gave Obama's campaign $530,000 - five times the $102,000 that they gave Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). This time, the advantage has flipped. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has taken in $135,450 from GE employees - four times the $38,032 that Obama has secured, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. GE's political action committee also has given more to Republicans this year than Democrats. In 2010 and 2008, Democrats received more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boeing also has benefited in many ways from Obama's tenure. The president has pushed to expand the Export-Import Bank, a government agency that makes relatively inexpensive loans available to foreign customers buying U.S. products. Boeing, by far, has been the biggest beneficiary of those loans, which foreign airlines use to buy the companies' planes. His administration has worked to sell Boeing jets to commercial airlines and foreign militaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, Obama visited Boeing's factory in Everett, Wash. The next month, he appeared before the Business Roundtable, which McNerney chairs, and declared: &quot;I have to say that, given the number of planes that I've been selling around the world, I expect a gold watch upon my retirement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNerney and the lobby haven't been quite as effusive toward the president. The group, whose executive committee includes Immelt and Dimon, has clobbered the president with criticism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the Roundtable criticized Obama for using his executive powers to postpone construction of a U.S.-Canada oil pipeline that many say would create thousands of jobs and bolster the nation's energy supply. The group also lashed out at Obama for a proposal to overhaul corporate taxation that it said would keep U.S. companies facing unusually high tax rates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Engler, the president of the Roundtable, said executives have been frustrated that so little has been accomplished on issues such taxes and regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a bottom-line, balance-sheet analysis that gets made by corporate leaders and it is this: Are we getting some of the biggest problems and challenges in America dealt with?&quot; Engler said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is perhaps Dimon's view of the White House that draws the sharpest contrast with the Obama administration's attitude toward him. Dimon has visited the White House at least 18 times since 2009, according to a White House database, including at least one state dinner, and some inside the administration have in the past talked whimsically about him being a candidate for Treasury secretary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After JPMorgan announced in May a surprise $2 billion in losses as a result of risky trading strategy based in London, Obama publicly praised the bank, calling Dimon &quot;one of the smartest bankers we got.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dimon has been a major supporter of the Democratic caucus, giving more than $500,000 to Democrats over the past 20 years and $50,000 to Obama's inaugural festivities, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Dimon nor McNerney nor Immelt has given campaign contributions directly to a presidential candidate this year. Dimon has just given to two Democrats and two Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), who has said his job is to defeat Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would call myself a barely Democrat, at this point,&quot; Dimon said in May.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mitt Romney</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s transition team has been quietly meeting in recent weeks with General Services Administration officials to talk about planning for a Romney White House.          Stop! Do not start tweeting, &quot;He's measuring the drapes!&quot; and other such nonsense. Early transition planning is essential. And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">President Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s team also has touched base with GSA, we're hearing.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             The Presidential Transition Act of 2010, in play for the first time, encourages, almost mandates, that candidates begin transition plans in earnest starting right after the party conventions at the end of August and early September. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress passed the legislation because, especially in a post- Sept. 11 world, presidential transitions - with hundreds of staff members and major policy, personnel and other tasks to be completed in a limited time - have become too important to wait until the dust settles in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the law, GSA is going to do pretty much what it would normally do after the election: provide office space, secure communication, printing and binding, furniture and equipment, and other assistance, said former senator </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ted Kaufman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">(D-Del.), who sponsored the 2010 measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What it doesn't do is pay for staff salaries, consultants, mail, travel and so forth. The campaigns have to raise money for that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously, Obama would have an easier time in transition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They can talk to people and ask them to stay in their jobs for a while longer,&quot; said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Clay Johnson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who ran </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">George W. Bush</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s transition team in 2000. &quot;There is less 'new' that has to be dealt with and fewer incoming job-seekers and advice-givers,&quot; he added, &quot;and more time to deal with it.&quot;                       </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John Podesta</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who worked on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">President Bill Clinton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s 1996 transition and headed the 2008 Obama transition, recalled the 1996 operation was &quot;not a far-flung effort,&quot; although there was plenty to do.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's some continuity in personnel,&quot; he said, but you have to decide &quot;who to keep, who to walk to the exits, who you beg to stay. And you have to do this in the context of a lame-duck session&quot; and the possible fiscal cliff. &quot;It's also a time to set the priorities and tee up the strategies for the key policy initiatives of the second term,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, Romney's transition, headed by former Utah governor and Bush II Health and Human Services secretary </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mike Leavitt</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">             , would bring in a new Cabinet and thousands of political appointees, plus a new budget. The team can't really do all that needs to be done in the 75 days from election to inauguration, Johnson said, &quot;so they have to start early, doing more work and early work to be really prepared. This [jump-start] is a very good thing.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides &quot;believe in their hearts that they are going to be elected,&quot; he noted, so &quot;they should be working very hard to be ready - or we shouldn't take them seriously as candidates.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Policing body art          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you notice that your friendly Capitol Police officer appears a little more clean-cut, you might thank (or blame, depending on your aesthetics) proposed new rules governing the tattoos, piercings, brands, etc., that the Hill's cops may show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Under the regulations, first reported by National Journal, tattoos or other body markings may cover no more than a third of an officer's exposed flesh. Previous rules encouraged officers to cover their body art whenever possible. We assume the higher-ups will tote tape measures to enforce this.           Flashing offensive and profane ink also would be a no-no, including art that indicates &quot;criminal gang affiliation, depictions of sexually explicit art, nudity, or violence, etc.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guess that would make them the fashion police as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules, contained in a larger manual on internal policies under the heading &quot;Personal Grooming,&quot; are typical for many police forces, Lt. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Kimberly Schneider</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a police spokeswoman, tells the Loop. And lest any officers feel caught off guard, &quot;Acting Chief </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tom Reynolds</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">has delayed implementation of some directives while he continues working with the union about any concerns they might have,&quot; she added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems officers with tattoos that might put them on the wrong side of the rules have a few uncomfortable options: tattoo removal (ouch!) or wearing long sleeves and pants in the brutally hot Washington summer (ugh). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Bad guys (P)R us          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are you a foreign government with a stubborn image problem? Wondering how to spin those crackdowns on free speech or your propensity for jailing your critics? We might have the PR firm for you!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York-based Brown Lloyd James just picked up the Washington Embassy of Ecuador as a client, to the tune of $30,000 a month,  as noted in the PR industry bible O'Dwyers.           Brown Lloyd James sounds like a good fit for the job. It has experience, after all, in working with bad-guy governments whose reputations need considerable help. The firm fearlessly flacked for Syrian first lady Asma al-Assad, pitching American media stories - such as the profile of Assad in Vogue magazine - even as her husband's military was cracking down on dissidents. It also once helped promote the regime of now-deceased Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi. The head of the Public Relations Society of America called the work for Syria and Libya &quot;distinctly against the ethical tenets of modern public relations.&quot;                    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ecuador's Washington presence is clearly in need of some glass-half-full messaging as the country faces a host of what PR folks euphemistically call &quot;challenges.&quot; WikiLeaks founder</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Julian Assange</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">              is  seeking political asylum there; it looks like the country will defy Western sanctions to buy Iranian oil; and then there's the matter of President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rafael Correa</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s heavy-handed attempts to silence his critics in the media.           Brown Lloyd James took pains to distinguish Ecuador from less savory nations.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe in the importance of broadening relationships with countries that are recognized by official U.S. diplomacy,&quot; the firm said in a statement. &quot;The U.S. and Ecuador enjoy strong security, commercial, and cultural relations. With more than 1.5 million Ecuadorians living in America, thousands of Americans living in Ecuador, and thriving business and civil society interactions, deeper understanding is essential. We are happy to play a role in that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to filings with the Justice Department, the firm plans to help Ecuador with general public relations, &quot;particularly regarding the US-Ecuador relationship.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good luck with that.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frankly, I've seen enough of dancin' Rafalca Romney, the Republican presidential candidate's Olympics-bound dressage horse, to tide me over for a while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell mock &quot;the breathtakingly expensive so-called sport of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">dressage</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">as a therapeutic option for Ann Romney's multiple sclerosis&quot; was about as hilarious as that time Rush Limbaugh questioned whether Michael J. Fox was exaggerating the symptoms of his Parkinson's disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, I see nothing the least bit objectionable about the Democratic National Committee ad that featured old Rafalca prancing around, alongside clips of Mitt Romney hemming and hawing about releasing his tax returns. &quot;Do we really want a president who dances around the issues?'' the ad asked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By current standards - what, no Hitler or bin Laden? - the commercial was downright civilized. Yet it was taken down after complaints that it constituted an unseemly attack on Ann Romney, who was neither seen nor mentioned in the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shame on them, really,&quot; said former Minnesota governor and possible Romney vice-presidential pick Tim Pawlenty, who had not seen the ad but nevertheless pronounced it &quot;really, really low.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was? I've routinely defended women in politics, spouses included, of course, from unfair attacks - from racist &quot;jokes&quot; involving Michelle Obama to trivial slams on Ann Romney's designer T-shirt. But spouses are full partners in the current campaigns, strategically and every other way, as they ought to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And at some point - right now would be my preference - we've got to stop pretending that spouses are, by definition, off-limits, or should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, Michelle Obama is heading up a new get-out-the-vote initiative - the &quot;It Takes One&quot; program to encourage grass-roots voter turnout efforts. She's cutting ads touting the initiative, and as The Post's Krissah Thompson wrote Thursday, taking on an &quot;overtly political role that is rare for a first lady.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ann Romney, meanwhile, is raising money and giving a series of high-profile interviews - answering questions about possible veep choices by saying &quot;we&quot; haven't made any decisions yet. They're leading the charge, not sitting home asking how it went, and as they stand onstage, microphones in hand, it's absurd and even infantilizing to claim that they should be left alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike their children, they signed up for this, or so we've been told. Politics is a family business, and those involved in it can't have it both ways. (And while we're at it, can we please retire the tired formulation that any political wife is her husband's &quot;secret weapon&quot;?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the Democrats signaled they aren't ready for that: &quot;Our use of the Romneys' dressage horse was not meant to offend Mrs. Romney in any way, and we regret it if it did,&quot; DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse said on Thursday. &quot;We have no plans to invoke the horse any further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The horseplay was nothing to apologize for, though. Nor was there anything wrong with Romney invoking the wife of '04 Democratic nominee John Kerry:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry ran for president; you know, his wife, who has hundreds of millions of dollars - she never released her tax returns,&quot; Romney told Fox News. &quot;Somehow, this wasn't an issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure it was. It also wasn't quite the same, because Teresa Heinz Kerry wasn't the candidate, but I have every confidence that the Massachusetts senator's wife, who took a lot of heat during his presidential run, is holding up fine under the pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ann Romney again made news on Thursday when she told Robin Roberts of ABC News that &quot;you people&quot; - c'est nous! - won't be wheedling any more financial info out of Chez Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We give 10 percent of our income to our church every year,'' she said, like the full partner she is. &quot;Do you think that's the kind of person that's tried to hide things? No, he is so good about it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish Roberts had asked just what it is he's so good about, but she did ask why, then, Romney isn't just coughing up the returns, as any number of his fellow Republicans have done and have urged him to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've given all you people need to know and understand about our financial situation and about how we live our life,'' Ann Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The imperious-sounding &quot;you people'' landed with a thud, of course, and although it did sound like she hoped she'd get the same &quot;Oh, you poor thing!&quot; response as at the country club, I suspect the &quot;people&quot; she intended to invoke are journalists - a slam that's usually so crowd-pleasing she can be forgiven for thinking it would be an applause line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a top player in her husband's campaign, though, she'll have lots of time between now and November to make up for it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has repeatedly embraced three titans of American commerce, General Electric, Boeing and JPMorgan Chase, showering their chief executives with praise and adopting policies that benefit the companies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His economic stimulus package awarded $200 million in contracts to GE, according to the company, and he has traveled the world selling Boeing airplanes - even joking that he should receive a gold watch for how many he has sold. Obama rejected calls from some economists to break up the biggest banks after the financial crisis, leaving JPMorgan, the biggest of them all, whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet these companies - from corporate suites to the rank and file - have shown little enthusiasm for the president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top executives have repeatedly criticized his rhetoric and his policies or have declined to support some of his most significant proposals. Employees, in a contrast to 2008, have scaled back financial support for Obama's campaign.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's relationship with GE, Boeing and JPMorgan offers a window into his sometimes-strained dealings with corporate America. He has for 31 / 2 years tried to nurture better connections to business, inviting top executives into his inner circle, promoting manufacturing and exports, and pumping money into a weak economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he hasn't always received a positive reception, with executives complaining about his tone and his policies. That may create difficulties for Obama as he runs for reelection against Republican Mitt Romney, who says business experience is one of his chief credentials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's dwindling support among some in business is evidenced in campaign giving. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although employees of GE, Boeing and JPMorgan backed Obama and other Democratic candidates by wide margins in 2008, that backing has declined this year. GE and JPMorgan employees have switched their allegiance to Romney and his fellow Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, while Boeing employees continue to support the president, albeit by a smaller advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William M. Daley, who was serving as a senior JPMorgan executive and was a Boeing director when Obama tapped him in 2011 to be his chief of staff, said business leaders have generally not understood that the president's job is to represent American workers, not just business interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people in business have misjudged the president's intentions,&quot; Daley said. &quot;They don't understand the difficulties the American people are having.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;A lot of people in the business community have historically been and are Republicans. That's a fact of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to their public statements and people close to them, the chief executives of JPMorgan, GE and Boeing bear no ill will toward the White House and have had plenty of access to administration officials to advocate their views on business policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has bothered them has been the White House's rhetoric, which they perceive as sometimes unfairly critical of business, and its support of regulations that they consider burdensome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JPMorgan head Jamie Dimon, a longtime Democrat, has spent millions of his company's dollars lobbying against several provisions of the Dodd-Frank overhaul of financial regulation, which is one of Obama's signature domestic achievements. He also has expressed exasperation with Democratic rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've gotten disturbed at some of the Democrats' anti-business behavior, the attacks on work ethic and successful people,&quot; Dimon said in May on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boeing chief executive W. James McNerney Jr. was outraged by efforts by the National Labor Relations Board to try to stop Boeing from creating a non-union plant in South Carolina. Although the NLRB was not controlled by Obama, he appointed the board official who filed the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As chairman of the Business Roundtable, a lobby that has often been critical of Obama, McNerney has expressed concerns in conference calls and interviews about the administration's approach to medical and environmental regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, he has said, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, which fall under Obama's purview, often have had an attitude of &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; in their oversight of companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A person close to the Boeing chief said that he considered some of the White House's rhetoric early on as unfairly critical of corporate America but that it has improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, in a recent interview with Bloomberg Television, McNerney said the president needs to show more &quot;sensitivity&quot; to the needs of business. &quot;I think there could be more of it. There is some and they're trying to reach out, but no, I'd like to see more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GE chief executive Jeffrey Immelt, who has the high-profile post of chairman of Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, a group composed largely of executives who advise Obama on job creation, has been more reticent. But a person who has talked with Immelt said he shares many of the same concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although they have talked about business and the White House in the past, representatives of Immelt, McNerney and Dimon declined to comment for this article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's supporters say that his policies kept the economy out of a depression, and that big firms have earned robust profits during the recovery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think people are quick to forget how dire the situation was. We had our entire global financial system on the brink of disaster,&quot; said Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com and a campaign co-chairman. &quot;The president was part of the team that stabilized our global financial system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daley, who stepped down as chief of staff earlier this year, said the administration has worked hard to ensure that regulations make sense. But he was incredulous about the complaints regarding Obama's tone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a constant refrain: 'We don't like the rhetoric. Oh, my gosh, it's terrible,' &quot; Daley said. &quot;It's like, 'Hey, guys, politics is tough business.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, one of the two union leaders on the president's jobs council, said he has been dismayed by how top executives have responded to Obama's efforts to reach out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president, in good faith, thought these guys were some of the best and brightest titans out there. They'll come in and tell [him] about what they need to create jobs,&quot; he said. Instead, &quot;they were concerned about their niche rather than about the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trumka recalled a meeting of the council in Pittsburgh one morning in October, at a time when Obama was promoting a $450 billion package of measures to boost job growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union leader rose from his seat, looked at Immelt and said, &quot;The president has just put out a jobs bill. Don't you think one of the things we should do as his jobs council is look at that and adopt it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Trumka, Immelt replied: &quot;We think that's too political.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trumka recalled saying, &quot;Adopting the president's jobs bill is too political? What in it don't you agree with? Tell me what it is you don't agree with. What would be bad for jobs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation moved on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has benefited from the relationships he has had with executives. Having never worked in the private sector, he is able to show that he can rely on the expertise of some of the country's leading executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has used his close relationship with Warren Buffett, one of the nation's most prominent businessmen, to promote the White House's plan to increase taxes on the wealthy. (Buffett's Berkshire-Hathaway is the largest shareholder of The Washington Post Co.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also has been able to claim part of the credit - or at least share the stage - for major deals to sell U.S.-manufactured goods to foreign customers, supporting American jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GE has been a beneficiary of a number of Obama administration policies - namely efforts to nurture a domestic clean energy industry. GE manufactures many technologies used in clean energy, such as wind turbines. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immelt was welcomed into Obama's inner circle at the beginning of the term, and he has made it clear that he won't back any candidate in this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, overall, GE and its employees have moved from supporting Obama and the Democrats to Romney and the Republicans this year. In the 2008 cycle, GE employees gave Obama's campaign $530,000 - five times the $102,000 that they gave Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). This time, the advantage has flipped. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has taken in $135,450 from GE employees - four times the $38,032 that Obama has secured, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. GE's political action committee also has given more to Republicans this year than Democrats. In 2010 and 2008, Democrats received more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boeing also has benefited in many ways from Obama's tenure. The president has pushed to expand the Export-Import Bank, a government agency that makes relatively inexpensive loans available to foreign customers buying U.S. products. Boeing, by far, has been the biggest beneficiary of those loans, which foreign airlines use to buy the companies' planes. His administration has worked to sell Boeing jets to commercial airlines and foreign militaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, Obama visited Boeing's factory in Everett, Wash. The next month, he appeared before the Business Roundtable, which McNerney chairs, and declared: &quot;I have to say that, given the number of planes that I've been selling around the world, I expect a gold watch upon my retirement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNerney and the lobby haven't been quite as effusive toward the president. The group, whose executive committee includes Immelt and Dimon, has clobbered the president with criticism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the Roundtable criticized Obama for using his executive powers to postpone construction of a U.S.-Canada oil pipeline that many say would create thousands of jobs and bolster the nation's energy supply. The group also lashed out at Obama for a proposal to overhaul corporate taxation that it said would keep U.S. companies facing unusually high tax rates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Engler, the president of the Roundtable, said executives have been frustrated that so little has been accomplished on issues such taxes and regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a bottom-line, balance-sheet analysis that gets made by corporate leaders and it is this: Are we getting some of the biggest problems and challenges in America dealt with?&quot; Engler said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is perhaps Dimon's view of the White House that draws the sharpest contrast with the Obama administration's attitude toward him. Dimon has visited the White House at least 18 times since 2009, according to a White House database, including at least one state dinner, and some inside the administration have in the past talked whimsically about him being a candidate for Treasury secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After JPMorgan announced in May a surprise $2 billion in losses as a result of risky trading strategy based in London, Obama publicly praised the bank, calling Dimon &quot;one of the smartest bankers we got.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dimon has been a major supporter of the Democratic caucus, giving more than $500,000 to Democrats over the past 20 years and $50,000 to Obama's inaugural festivities, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Dimon nor McNerney nor Immelt has given campaign contributions directly to a presidential candidate this year. Dimon has just given to two Democrats and two Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), who has said his job is to defeat Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would call myself a barely Democrat, at this point,&quot; Dimon said in May.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney's transition team has been quietly meeting in recent weeks with General Services Administration officials to talk about planning for a Romney White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stop! Do not start tweeting, &quot;He's measuring the drapes!&quot; and other such nonsense. Early transition planning is essential. And President Obama's team also has touched base with GSA, we're hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Presidential Transition Act of 2010, in play for the first time, encourages, almost mandates, that candidates begin transition plans in earnest starting right after the party conventions at the end of August and early September. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress passed the legislation because, especially in a post- Sept. 11 world, presidential transitions - with hundreds of staff members and major policy, personnel and other tasks to be completed in a limited time - have become too important to wait until the dust settles in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the law, GSA is going to do pretty much what it would normally do after the election: provide office space, secure communication, printing and binding, furniture and equipment, and other assistance, said former senator Ted Kaufman (D-Del.), who sponsored the 2010 measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What it doesn't do is pay for staff salaries, consultants, mail, travel and so forth. The campaigns have to raise money for that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously, Obama would have an easier time in transition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They can talk to people and ask them to stay in their jobs for a while longer,&quot; said Clay Johnson, who ran George W. Bush's transition team in 2000. &quot;There is less 'new' that has to be dealt with and fewer incoming job-seekers and advice-givers,&quot; he added, &quot;and more time to deal with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Podesta, who worked on President Bill Clinton's 1996 transition and headed the 2008 Obama transition, recalled the 1996 operation was &quot;not a far-flung effort,&quot; although there was plenty to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's some continuity in personnel,&quot; he said, but you have to decide &quot;who to keep, who to walk to the exits, who you beg to stay. And you have to do this in the context of a lame-duck session&quot; and the possible fiscal cliff. &quot;It's also a time to set the priorities and tee up the strategies for the key policy initiatives of the second term,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, Romney's transition, headed by former Utah governor and Bush II Health and Human Services secretary Mike Leavitt, would bring in a new Cabinet and thousands of political appointees, plus a new budget. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team can't really do all that needs to be done in the 75 days from election to inauguration, Johnson said, &quot;so they have to start early, doing more work and early work to be really prepared. This [jump-start] is a very good thing.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides &quot;believe in their hearts that they are going to be elected,&quot; he noted, so &quot;they should be working very hard to be ready - or we shouldn't take them seriously as candidates.&quot; <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Policing body art</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you notice that your friendly Capitol Police officer appears a little more clean-cut, you might thank (or blame, depending on your aesthetics) proposed new rules governing the tattoos, piercings, brands, etc., that the Hill's cops may show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the regulations, first reported by National Journal, tattoos or other body markings may cover no more than a third of an officer's exposed flesh. Previous rules encouraged officers to cover their body art whenever possible. We assume the higher-ups will tote tape measures to enforce this. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flashing offensive and profane ink also would be a no-no, including art that indicates &quot;criminal gang affiliation, depictions of sexually explicit art, nudity, or violence, etc.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guess that would make them the fashion police as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules, contained in a larger manual on internal policies under the heading &quot;Personal Grooming,&quot; are typical for many police forces, Lt. Kimberly Schneider, a police spokeswoman, tells the Loop. And lest any officers feel caught off guard, &quot;Acting Chief Tom Reynolds has delayed implementation of some directives while he continues working with the union about any concerns they might have,&quot; she added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems officers with tattoos that might put them on the wrong side of the rules have a few uncomfortable options: tattoo removal (ouch!) or wearing long sleeves and pants in the brutally hot Washington summer (ugh). <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bad guys (P)R us</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are you a foreign government with a stubborn image problem? Wondering how to spin those crackdowns on free speech or your propensity for jailing your critics? We might have the PR firm for you!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York-based Brown Lloyd James just picked up the Washington Embassy of Ecuador as a client, to the tune of $30,000 a month,  as noted in the PR industry bible O'Dwyers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown Lloyd James sounds like a good fit for the job. It has experience, after all, in working with bad-guy governments whose reputations need considerable help. The firm fearlessly flacked for Syrian first lady Asma al-Assad, pitching American media stories - such as the profile of Assad in Vogue magazine - even as her husband's military was cracking down on dissidents. It also once helped promote the regime of now-deceased Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi. The head of the Public Relations Society of America called the work for Syria and Libya &quot;distinctly against the ethical tenets of modern public relations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ecuador's Washington presence is clearly in need of some glass-half-full messaging as the country faces a host of what PR folks euphemistically call &quot;challenges.&quot; WikiLeaks founder Julian Assangeis seeking political asylum there; it looks like the country will defy Western sanctions to buy Iranian oil; and then there's the matter of President Rafael Correa's heavy-handed attempts to silence his critics in the media. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frankly, I've seen enough of dancin' Rafalca Romney, the Republican presidential candidate's Olympics-bound dressage horse, to tide me over for a while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell mock &quot;the breathtakingly expensive so-called sport of dressage as a therapeutic option for Ann Romney's multiple sclerosis&quot; was about as hilarious as that time Rush Limbaugh questioned whether Michael J. Fox was exaggerating the symptoms of his Parkinson's disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, I see nothing the least bit objectionable about the Democratic National Committee ad that featured old Rafalca prancing around, alongside clips of Mitt Romney hemming and hawing about releasing his tax returns. &quot;Do we really want a president who dances around the issues?'' the ad asked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By current standards - what, no Hitler or bin Laden? - the commercial was downright civilized. Yet it was taken down after complaints that it constituted an unseemly attack on Ann Romney, who was neither seen nor mentioned in the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shame on them, really,&quot; said former Minnesota governor and possible Romney vice-presidential pick Tim Pawlenty, who had not seen the ad but nevertheless pronounced it &quot;really, really low.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was? I've routinely defended women in politics, spouses included, of course, from unfair attacks - from racist &quot;jokes&quot; involving Michelle Obama to trivial slams on Ann Romney's designer T-shirt. But spouses are full partners in the current campaigns, strategically and every other way, as they ought to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And at some point - right now would be my preference - we've got to stop pretending that spouses are, by definition, off-limits, or should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, Michelle Obama is heading up a new get-out-the-vote initiative - the &quot;It Takes One&quot; program to encourage grass-roots voter turnout efforts. She's cutting ads touting the initiative, and as The Post's Krissah Thompson wrote Thursday, taking on an &quot;overtly political role that is rare for a first lady.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ann Romney, meanwhile, is raising money and giving a series of high-profile interviews - answering questions about possible veep choices by saying &quot;we&quot; haven't made any decisions yet. They're leading the charge, not sitting home asking how it went, and as they stand onstage, microphones in hand, it's absurd and even infantilizing to claim that they should be left alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike their children, they signed up for this, or so we've been told. Politics is a family business, and those involved in it can't have it both ways. (And while we're at it, can we please retire the tired formulation that any political wife is her husband's &quot;secret weapon&quot;?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the Democrats signaled they aren't ready for that: &quot;Our use of the Romneys' dressage horse was not meant to offend Mrs. Romney in any way, and we regret it if it did,&quot; DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse said on Thursday. &quot;We have no plans to invoke the horse any further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The horseplay was nothing to apologize for, though. Nor was there anything wrong with Romney invoking the wife of '04 Democratic nominee John Kerry:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry ran for president; you know, his wife, who has hundreds of millions of dollars - she never released her tax returns,&quot; Romney told Fox News. &quot;Somehow, this wasn't an issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure it was. It also wasn't quite the same, because Teresa Heinz Kerry wasn't the candidate, but I have every confidence that the Massachusetts senator's wife, who took a lot of heat during his presidential run, is holding up fine under the pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ann Romney again made news on Thursday when she told Robin Roberts of ABC News that &quot;you people&quot; - c'est nous! - won't be wheedling any more financial info out of Chez Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We give 10 percent of our income to our church every year,'' she said, like the full partner she is. &quot;Do you think that's the kind of person that's tried to hide things? No, he is so good about it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish Roberts had asked just what it is he's so good about, but she did ask why, then, Romney isn't just coughing up the returns, as any number of his fellow Republicans have done and have urged him to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've given all you people need to know and understand about our financial situation and about how we live our life,'' Ann Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The imperious-sounding &quot;you people'' landed with a thud, of course, and although it did sound like she hoped she'd get the same &quot;Oh, you poor thing!&quot; response as at the country club, I suspect the &quot;people&quot; she intended to invoke are journalists - a slam that's usually so crowd-pleasing she can be forgiven for thinking it would be an applause line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a top player in her husband's campaign, though, she'll have lots of time between now and November to make up for it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign unveiled an advertisement on Wednesday that contends that under President Obama, stimulus money went to the president's political donors and to overseas companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE SCRIPT </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Where did all the Obama stimulus money go? Friends, donors, campaign supporters, special-interest groups. Where did the Obama stimulus money go? Solyndra. 500 million taxpayer dollars. Bankrupt. So where did the Obama stimulus money go? Windmills from China, electric cars from Finland.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, says, ''Seventy-nine percent of the $2.1 billion in stimulus grants awarded through it went to overseas companies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON SCREEN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The script is displayed in block letters as the narrator speaks. In the background are dollar bills set on fire and tumbling to the ground. Mr. Schumer is shown speaking at a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCURACY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the ad is false, including its first claim. Referring to the 2009 stimulus law backed by President Obama and passed by the Democratic-controlled Congress, the ad asks where ''all'' the stimulus money went and then answers its own question by saying to special-interest groups and friends and backers of Mr. Obama. But of $763 billion in stimulus money used so far, the largest amount has been hundreds of billions of dollars for such things as a tax credit for working middle-income families, larger exemptions for families hit by the alternative minimum tax, public school funding and Medicaid grants. The ad accurately notes that a little over $500 million was for loan guarantees for Solyndra, a solar energy firm that collapsed last year. The company's largest investor was a nonprofit antipoverty foundation whose major backer is an Obama fund-raiser. But another major Solyndra investor was a firm connected with donors to the Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad's claim that stimulus money went to ''electric cars from Finland'' is false, according to the car's manufacturer and the Energy Department. The struggling company, Fisker Automotive, received approval from Obama administration officials for $529 million in government loans under a George W. Bush-era program, not the stimulus. Most of that loan, intended for a plant in Delaware, has been suspended. The $193 million actually lent to Fisker was spent in the United States, not at its plant in Finland, according to Fisker and the Energy Department. Fisker's investors include firms whose executives have donated to both parties. In the ad, Mr. Schumer complains that 79 percent of $2.1 billion in stimulus grants went to overseas companies, referring in part to wind turbines made in China. But this is one narrow slice of the overall stimulus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCORECARD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad tries to paint Mr. Obama as someone who rewarded donors with taxpayer stimulus money, a tough response to the Obama campaign's recent attacks on Mr. Romney's investments and business career. RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 20</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">908 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few things seem to pique President Obama like Fox News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider some recent barbs from the campaign trail. At a bar in Ohio where a television was tuned to Fox News, the president joked that one of the customers should ask to change the channel. ''The customer is always right,'' Mr. Obama cracked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week he used the network as a punch line in his stump speech, saying that ''Uncle Jim'' -- a fictional amalgam of his conservative critics -- was ''a little stubborn and been watching Fox News.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there was an interview with Valerie Jarrett, one of Mr. Obama's senior advisers. Ms. Jarrett was asked why some voters had the impression that the president was attacking the rich. ''Well, they may be watching one particular network,'' she sniffed. ''CNN?'' the interviewer teased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of this has gone unnoticed inside the studios and executive suites of Fox News, which is rebuffing these White House put-downs as a denigration of the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think it lowers the office,'' Michael Clemente, Fox's executive vice president of news, said in an interview on Wednesday. ''For it to come up as regularly as it does -- and it's not every day but every other week, I'd say -- it's just unusual. Especially given the issues out there, like the lack of new jobs and Syria.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of all the items on the president's plate, Mr. Clemente added, ''I would like to be 15th on the list, not 3rd.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News and the Obama White House have never enjoyed a warm relationship. But after a caustic feud erupted in late 2009, the two seemed to agree to coexist peacefully. Glenn Beck, the incendiary host who called the president a racist, left after a falling-out with executives. The Fox News chairman, Roger Ailes, professed to be steering the network toward a ''course correction,'' an acknowledgment that it had shifted too hard to the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, with the presidential campaign entering its most competitive phase, the simmering tensions between Mr. Obama and the country's highest-rated news channel threaten their fragile detente.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House and the Obama campaign in Chicago both view Fox News with a degree of skepticism. ''We work with Fox News and their reporters in a professional way every day,'' said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. ''But we're not naive about their business model.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turn on Fox News and much of the coverage is focused on stories that are unflattering to the White House. Far more than any other network, it chronicles daily developments in the scandal over Operation Fast and Furious, which involves a botched federal gun-tracking operation that has become a cause celebre among conservatives. A Congressional investigation into the matter -- another news event that has received careful attention on Fox -- resulted in a contempt vote in the House of Representatives against Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. Fox News was the only cable news network early on to carry proceedings from the contempt hearings live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details of the bankruptcy of Solyndra, an alternative energy company that received $528 million in federal loan guarantees after heavily lobbying the White House, are well known to regular Fox viewers. So far this week, the story dominating Fox newscasts has been the conservative furor over a recent remark by the president that business owners owed much of their success to government investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News tends to benefit when it covers Mr. Obama and the Democrats aggressively. Indeed, during the height of the 2009 spat between Fox News and the White House, the channel's ratings grew 8 percent over all. And while many of its commentators and on-air guests may be rooting for a Mitt Romney victory, privately Fox executives say that a second Obama term could be the best thing that ever happened to their network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, Mr. Obama has enjoyed hitting the Fox News punching bag now and again. During his 2008 campaign, just mentioning the network in a stump speech would rile up the crowd. A typical dig at Fox News would go something like this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama would remark how engaged voters seemed to be. They were watching the debates, CNN and C-Span, he said. Then he would pause dramatically. ''And Fox News,'' he added, to a chorus of sonorous boos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political experts said Mr. Obama's swipes at Fox News then and now seem to be in keeping with a strategy to discredit his opponents, a tactic the campaign has deployed rather effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Whoever it is who may be a source of strength for Romney, they're out there trying to discredit them in some fashion,'' said David Gergen, an adviser to Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. ''It's an old tactic, and it often works.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House insists that the president does not have a preoccupation with Fox News, and that both of the president's recent Fox quips were ad-libbed. The remark in Ohio came in an unrehearsed exchange with a potential voter. And the ''Uncle Jim'' comment, while uttered during a campaign speech, was not part of the written text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You would be surprised how low on the list of priorities this is,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Clemente says he assumes that Mr. Obama feels frustrated with how he is covered, and from time to time likes to vent. The intensity of their dispute, he added, is far lower than it was in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're examining and analyzing,'' Mr. Clemente said. ''And I think that can be annoying at times.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, he noted dryly, ''we're not C-Span.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney accused President Obama on Wednesday of caring more about his own job security than about creating jobs for millions of unemployed Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While pressing his case against the Democrat, Romney showed no sign of caving into mounting pressure for him to release more of his tax returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Ohio, a state key to the political fates of both contenders, Romney said the president in the past six months has held more than 100 fundraisers for his re-election campaign and no meetings with his jobs council. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney is trying to portray Obama as out of touch with the economic pain afflicting millions of people,  while shifting the focus from his personal finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His priority is trying to keep his own job, and that's why he's going to lose it,&quot; Romney declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having spent most of Tuesday courting donors across Texas, Obama was  at the White House on Wednesday. He will head out today on a two-day campaign swing through Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have pressed for the release of more of Romney's tax returns and have hounded him about discrepancies over when he left his private equity firm, Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're going to run for president, it's not necessarily comfortable but it has become a tradition and it's an important one, you make your tax returns available because you think the American people deserve that kind of transparency,&quot; Obama spokesman Jay Carney told reporters at the White House on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, took a rare step into the presidential race Wednesday, saying Obama's criticism of Romney's career and taxes are meant to distract from the administration's handling of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boehner said Obama's questions are an &quot;attack on the private sector&quot; and show he &quot;doesn't give a damn about middle-class Americans who are out there looking for work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boehner also warned those, including fellow Republicans who increasingly are calling on Romney to make more of his past tax returns public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American people are asking, 'Where are the jobs?' &quot; Boehner said. &quot;They're not asking where the hell the tax returns are. It's not about tax returns. It's about the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being on his heels for several days over taxes and his Bain record, Romney launched an aggressive counterattack this week, punctuated by biting speeches, conference calls and a TV ad Wednesday accusing Obama of &quot;crony capitalism.&quot; The ad says Obama sent stimulus money to &quot;friends, donors, campaign supporters and special interest groups&quot; and charges that taxpayer dollars went to projects in Finland and China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks marked a substantial escalation for the often-reserved Romney, who has struggled to answer questions about his business career and personal tax returns. Romney who would be among the nation's wealthiest presidents if elected, so far has released just one year of personal income tax returns and promised to release a second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a stark deviation from a tradition created in part by  his father, George Romney,  released 12 years of his returns during his 1968 presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several prominent Republicans have joined Democrats in pushing Romney to release more tax returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Minnesota  governor Tim Pawlenty, who features prominently in speculation about Romney's choice for a running mate, vigorously defended Romney's limited tax release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no claim or no credible indication that he's done anything wrong,&quot; Pawlenty said Wednesday on CBS This Morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pawlenty accused Obama's campaign of &quot;hanging shiny objects before the public and the press, and the press is taking the bait.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ad from the Mitt Romney campaign popped up Sunday during Face the Nation, the CBS public affairs show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transcript</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Schieffer, Face the Nation host: &quot;When the president was elected, he talked about hope and change. Whatever happened to hope and change? Now it seems he's just coming right out of the box with these old-fashioned negative ads.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Brooks, New York Times columnist: &quot;By starting negative, by going extremely tough and extremely hard, looking conventional, and frankly running ads that are inaccurate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Halperin, Time journalist: &quot;Barack Obama's campaign and allies will run more negative ads against this Republican nominee in 2012 than have ever been run in the history of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schieffer: &quot;Whatever happened to hope and change?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visuals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A TV screen on a shelf shows clips of Schieffer and the two commentators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ad is a complaint about the Obama campaign's attacks on Romney's Bain Capital record and his wealth. At the same time, of course, the Romney campaign attacks Obama for awarding federal research grants to campaign donors. The spot tries to add weight to its message by delivering criticisms via the words of news reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ad appeared during Sunday's broadcast of Face The Nation and so surprised Schieffer that he commented on it during the show, pointing out to viewers that the ad was made without his permission and that he is not affiliated with the Romney campaign. In the clip, Schieffer was questioning Obama senior strategist Robert Gibbs on May 27 -- and in his question, he added that negative advertising appears to be a staple of all campaigns, not just Obama's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brooks appeared on Meet the Press the same day. Halperin's comments, when he made them on MSNBC's Morning Joe in June 2011, were hypothetical -- there was no presumptive GOP nominee at that time, and the discussion was about whether former Utah governor Jon Huntsman would be able to withstand negative advertising. Halperin has objected to being shown in the ad.  He repeated, via Twitter, objections made by NBC's Tom Brokaw, who appeared in an old clip in a Romney&nbsp;ad attacking Newt Gingrich during the primaries. &quot;I am extremely uncomfortable with the use of my personal image in this political ad. I do not want my role as a journalist compromised for political gain by any campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action have spent $32 million on negative ads, and Romney and the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future have spent $44.9 million, including in the primaries, according to data tracked by Kantar Media/CMAG and reported in The Washington Post. <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney's overseas trip next week will take him to the heart of London's scandal-ridden banking industry, as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee holds two campaign fundraisers hosted by lobbyists and executives from more than two dozen financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hosts of Romney's high-dollar reception and dinner on July 26 overwhelmingly represent banks, hedge funds and other financial institutions, some of which are embroiled in the Libor rate-fixing scandal.          By appearing at the fundraisers on the eve of the Olympics' Opening Ceremonies, Romney risks associating his campaign with the unfolding scandal, which focuses on banks that manipulated the London interbank offered rate, a benchmark for mortgages, auto loans and other financial contracts.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the event's co-chairs is Patrick Durkin, a Washington-based lobbyist for Barclays, which agreed last month to pay $450 million to settle allegations that it manipulated Libor before and after the financial crisis. Durkin has helped raise $1.1 million for the Romney campaign, according to U.S. disclosure records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, the Boston Globe reported that Barclays' chief executive, Bob Diamond, withdrew as a co-host after the bank settled with British and U.S. authorities. He resigned July 3 from Barclays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney events have sparked anger among some members of the British Parliament, who have called on Barclays executives to halt political fundraising while the scandal plays out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executives of at least three other banks under investigation in the Libor scandal - Eric Varvel, chief executive of Credit Suisse; Raj Bhattacharyya, a managing director at Deutsche Bank; and Whitfield Hines, a managing director at HSBC - are co-chairs, according to copies of invitations obtained by The Washington Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 15 banks are under investigation by British regulators in connection with the Libor manipulations, according to regulatory filings and statements.          Romney is holding two London fundraisers: a $2,500-per-person reception and a dinner costing $25,000 to $75,000 per person.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Romney campaign spokeswoman declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's is not the only campaign raising money from Barclays executives. Vice President Biden held a fundraiser this month in Park City, Utah, co-hosted by Mark Gilbert, a Barclays investment banker who is deputy finance director at the Democratic National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. election law allows candidates to raise money from U.S. citizens overseas, and presidential hopefuls have long sought donations from them. A Post analysis of Federal Election Commission reports shows that President Obama has raised $3.1 million from expatriates, compared with $1.4 million for Romney. Obama's total includes at least $600,000 from addresses in Britain, $176,000 from Switzerland and $63,000 from China. Romney has drawn at least $311,000 from Britain and $140,000 from Hong Kong. The figures are imprecise because some Americans living overseas maintain U.S. addresses. Only U.S. citizens and legal residents may give to presidential campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, a former private equity manager, has relied heavily on campaign donations from those in the finance and banking industries, including employees of the firm he co-founded, Bain Capital.According to the invitations, the hosts of Romney's events overwhelmingly come from the finance industry, including such major firms as Goldman Sachs, Blackstone, Wells Fargo and Cerberus. There are co-hosts from Bain Capital and Ropes &amp; Gray, the Boston law firm with close ties to Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also hosting are Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets; Dan Bricken, a managing director at Wells Fargo Securities; Gregg Lemkau, head of European mergers and acquisitions for Goldman Sachs; Dwight Poler, a managing director for Bain Capital Europe; Anthony Diamandakis, a managing director at Credit Suisse; and Calvin Tarlton, a director at Wells Fargo Securities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Facing mounting calls to release more details about his taxes, Mitt Romney remains steadfast against disclosure. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10:11 p.m. | Updated  A revised version of this post is available here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney has said it every way he can: He is not releasing any more of his tax returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, is facing millions of dollars in searing ads from President Obama and a rising chorus of puzzled Republicans, all urging him to reveal more of his financial history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with each answer he gives, Mr. Romney seems more determined than ever that voters will not see any of his tax history before 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the political environment that exists today, the opposition research of the Obama campaign is looking for anything they can use to distract from the failure of the president to reignite our economy,&quot; Mr. Romney told National Review on Tuesday, explaining his opposition to a broader release of his personal tax data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm simply not enthusiastic about giving them hundreds or thousands of more pages to pick through, distort and lie about,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That follows an equally emphatic statement last Friday, when Mr. Romney brushed aside calls for him to make public more than the 2010 returns he has released and the 2011 documents he has said are coming soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those are the two years people are going to have, and that's all that's necessary for people to understand something about my finances,&quot; Mr. Romney said in an interview on CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The definitive nature of Mr. Romney's statements appears to have all but shut down any public contemplation from his close advisers that he might reconsider. Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, declined to talk about internal discussions on the issue, but made clear who was in charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would point you to the governor's statements,&quot; Mr. Madden said. &quot;That guides the campaign's position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another senior adviser to the campaign said Wednesday that he had &quot;heard of no division in the inner circle on this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is determined not to release more, and they support him,&quot; the adviser said of Mr. Romney and his aides. &quot;Plus, there is no evidence that voters care about this. They think they know enough about Mitt Romney's finances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that answer has not satisfied a growing number of Republicans who have said that Mr. Romney's refusal to release more of his tax returns threatens to do him lasting political damage as he nears the final stage of the presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the editors of National Review wrote that the Republican campaign was &quot;playing into the president's hands&quot; by refusing to release the tax returns. They predicted that Mr. Romney would eventually have to cave in to the demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only question is whether he releases more returns now, or later - after playing more defense on the issue and sustaining more hits,&quot; they wrote. &quot;There will surely be a press feeding frenzy over new returns, but better to weather it in the middle of July.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last several days, similar calls have come from Republican pundits and governors, and from some of Mr. Romney's former rivals for the party's nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Politically, I think that would help him,&quot; Representative Ron Paul of Texas told Politico. &quot;In the scheme of things politically, you know, it looks like releasing tax returns is what the people want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Will, the conservative commentator, said on ABC's &quot;This Week&quot; on Sunday that Mr. Romney should release more tax returns quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If something's going to come out, get it out in a hurry,&quot; Mr. Will said. &quot;I do not know why, given that Mitt Romney knew the day that McCain lost in 2008 that he was going to run for president again that he didn't get all of this out and tidy up some of his offshore accounts and all the rest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's hard-and-fast refusals have also energized the Democratic attacks. Mr. Obama's Chicago-based campaign is continuing to hammer him with new television ads, web videos and commentary from surrogates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic National Committee on Wednesday released a videomaking fun of Mr. Romney by juxtaposing his statements on his tax returns with images of a man in a top hat doing a horse ballet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do we really want a president who dances around the issues?&quot; the video asks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A television ad by Mr. Obama's campaign went up in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, just as Mr. Romney held an event in the state. Titled &quot;Makes you Wonder,&quot; the ad raises the possibilities that Mr. Romney has additional overseas tax havens that would be revealed by releasing his tax returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Makes you wonder if some years he paid any taxes at all,&quot; the ad says. &quot;We don't know because Romney has released just one full year of his tax returns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign has sought to change the subject, accusing the Democrats of going on the attack because of what they say are the failed economic policies of Mr. Obama's administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Madden said that Mr. Romney had disclosed personal financial information &quot;beyond what the law requires&quot; and said that should be enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's important to voters is the state of the economy and who's going to fix it,&quot; he said. &quot;What they really want is a focus on the issues. That's where the governor is focused.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The Candidate can neither escape nor defend his career. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two presidential campaigns are still arguing about when Mitt Romney left Bain Capital, but from a political perspective the date really doesn't matter, because Bain never left Mitt Romney. The company's business practices, before and after his departure, will trail him wherever he goes, and now they have turned up in the northern Illinois city of Freeport. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a plant in Freeport that makes sensors and controls for cars and airplanes. It's owned by Sensata Technologies, a company that Bain bought in 2006, somewhere between four and seven years after Mr. Romney left the company. Last year, Sensata announced that it was moving the plant to China at the end of 2012 and laying off all 170 workers, and now those workers are asking Mr. Romney to intervene with his colleagues to save their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he wanted to, all he needs to do is call up the management of Bain Capital and say, 'Look, don't do this,' &quot; one worker, Tom Gaulrapp, told Reuters.<BR><BR>Mr. Romney had nothing to do with that decision. It would be troubling to learn that the candidate still had such power over the company and was willing to exercise it. The workers, obviously desperate, are hoping that the campaign's need to avoid bad publicity might help them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, Mr. Romney remains deeply tied to business decisions like this. As Bain's founder, he established its business model, which is to wring the maximum efficiency from a company for the benefit of Bain's investors, even if that means closing plants, shipping jobs to China, and laying off American workers. That's how private equity often works, and Bain has done it many times before, sometimes to the benefit of a company's workers, and sometimes to their detriment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bain first led a buyout of Sensata, in fact, it laid off hundreds of American workers and sent their jobs offshore. As the Times reported, the Labor Department spent $780,000 retraining some of the laid-off employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Mr. Romney's generous retirement agreement ensures that he continues to profit from the deals and decisions that Bain makes. He owns about $8 million worth of Bain funds that hold 51 percent of Sensata's shares. If Sensata saves money by closing the Freeport plant, that could add money to Mr. Romney's trust accounts, now or after the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many conservatives want Mr. Romney to make a full-throated defense of these practices, and hope he explains to Americans that plant closings and offshoring are a natural part of capitalism and can have long-term positive effects for the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Romney clearly feels he can't do that, because the political effect of defending layoffs would be toxic. That's especially true because his entire campaign is built around accusing President Obama of not creating enough American jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As on so many issues, he is trapped between his past and his politics, unable to defend his career and unable to escape it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign unveiled a new advertisement on Wednesday that contends  that under President Obama,  stimulus money went to the president's political friends and donors and to overseas companies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Click on a subsection below to jump to a fact check. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YouTube</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">0:01&nbsp; Stimulus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the 2009 stimulus law backed by President Obama and passed by the Democratic-controlled Congress, the ad asks where &quot;all&quot; the stimulus money went and then answers its own question by saying to special-interest groups and friends and backers of Mr. Obama. But of $763 billion in stimulus used so far, the largest amount has been hundreds of billions of dollars for such things as a tax credit for working middle-income families, larger exemptions for families hit by the Alternative Minimum Tax, public school funding and Medicaid grants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">0:09&nbsp; Solyndra</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad accurately notes that a little over $500 million was for loan guarantees for Solyndra, a solar energy firm that collapsed last year. The company's largest investor was a nonprofit antipoverty foundation whose major backer is an Obama fund-raiser.  But another major Solyndra investor was a firm thatwhose employees?  includes donors to the Republican party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">0:17&nbsp; Cars in Finland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad's claim that stimulus money went to &quot;electric cars from Finland&quot; is false, according to the car's manufacturer and the Energy Department. The struggling company, Fisker Automotive, received approval from Obama administration officials for $529 million in government loans under a George W. Bush-era program, not the stimulus. Most of that loan, intended for a plant in Delaware, has been suspended.  The $193 million actually lent to Fisker was spent in the United States, not in Finland, according to Fisker and the Energy Department.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">0:21&nbsp; Schumer's Criticisms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Schumer is complaining that 79 percent of $2.1 billion in stimulus grants went to overseas companies, referring in part to wind turbines made in China. But this  is one narrow slice of the overall stimulus.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scorecard<BR>The ad tries to tarnish Mr. Obama as someone who rewarded cronies with taxpayer stimulus funds, a tough response to the Obama campaign's recent attacks on Mr. Romney's investments and business career.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political pressure on Mitt Romney to release more of his personal income tax returns is causing some divisions inside the GOP presidential candidate's camp, according to a Republican strategist close to the campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although some advisers are arguing privately that Romney needs to release additional filings to curb the political fallout, others are resisting that suggestion, reflecting the candidate's longtime reluctance to publicly disclose information about his personal finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to Romney, would not discuss internal debate about strategy but said there is only one opinion that matters in the internal strategy debate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The final voice on this is the governor's, and he's made it very clear that the two years that he's provided represent going above and beyond what's required to be disclosed,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about his taxes in a telephone interview Tuesday with National Review Online, Romney said: &quot;The opposition research of the Obama campaign is looking for anything they can use to distract from the failure of the president to reignite our economy.&quot;          He added: &quot;And I'm simply not enthusiastic about giving them hundreds or thousands of more pages to pick through, distort and lie about.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Tuesday, after the interview with Romney, the editors of the National Review wrote an editorial arguing that the only question for Romney is &quot;whether he releases more returns now, or later - after playing more defense on the issue and sustaining more hits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial adds to a growing chorus of Romney allies urging him to make the additional information public. In response to a reporter's question at the State Capitol in Austin, Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) also urged his former White House rival to be &quot;as transparent as you can be,&quot; although he appeared to stop short of calling on Romney to disclose more information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax issue took center stage Tuesday in a campaign that has grown more acrimonious by the day, and Romney maintained that he would not release more than just the past two years of tax returns because he does not want to give the Obama campaign ammunition to attack him.          One reason for Romney's reluctance is his belief that he will not be able to provide enough information to satisfy his critics.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It'll never be enough,&quot; Madden said. &quot;If you release 10, they'll want 20. If you release 20, they'll want 25, and whatever's in there will be open to their distortions and their dishonest attacks.&quot; The campaign has pointed to the fact that GOP nominee John McCain released only two years of returns during the 2008 campaign; Democrats have countered that McCain was the only one of the past seven White House challengers to release just two years of documents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Republicans say Romney's refusal to release the tax returns is beginning to cost him politically. &quot;Perception is becoming Romney's reality, and these issues have now risen above mere distractions,&quot; said GOP consultant John Weaver, a senior adviser for McCain's 2000 and 2008 bids. &quot;The president has had the worst three months of any incumbent, due to the economy, since George H.W. Bush in 1992, and yet Romney has lost traction among key demographic groups in the vital swing states. He has got to get this behind him or he's going to face summer definition a la [Bob] Dole and [John] Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign began running a new tax-themed campaign ad in Pennsylvania on Tuesday and appears ready to continue pummeling Romney on the tax issue, with or without the release of his returns. The ad speculates that the former Massachusetts governor's reluctance &quot;makes you wonder if some years he paid any taxes at all.&quot;          Among the Republicans jumping into the tax fray this week have been Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.), who told Politico on Tuesday that he thinks Romney should release more of his returns.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News Channel's Brit Hume weighed in on the matter Monday night, telling host Bill O'Reilly, &quot;I don't see any evidence that this is making a difference, but you know, anytime it's disclosure versus non-disclosure, you always wonder whether it isn't better to just put it out there.&quot;The two join Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R), former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour (R), and conservative commentators George F. Will and William Kristol in suggesting that the best move for Romney is to release the information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight over Romney's tax returns is part of a battle being waged by the candidates to control the turf on which the broader campaign is to play out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Obama, the goal is to focus on Romney's private-sector background - a point on which the president hammered his GOP rival at a fundraiser Tuesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's &quot;main calling card for wanting to be president is his private-sector experience, so we asked the voters to examine that experience,&quot; Obama said at his first fundraiser of the day, at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio, where he addressed a luncheon crowd of 1,200, including many Latino supporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a rally in Pennsylvania, Romney seized on a remark Obama made during a campaign stop in Virginia last week to make his case that the president is ill-equipped to fix the country's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said this: 'If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen,' &quot; Romney told the 700-member crowd at Horizontal Wireline, referring to Obama. &quot;That somebody else is government, in his view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney added that he thinks the president wants Americans to be &quot;ashamed of success&quot; and that Obama is &quot;changing the nature of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find it extraordinary that a philosophy of that nature would be spoken by a president of the United States,&quot; Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just as the messaging battle has ramped up, so, too, have some of the envelope-pushing attacks from both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the Obama campaign released a hard-hitting ad that appeared to question Romney's patriotism and featured footage of the candidate singing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, former New Hampshire governor John Sununu (R), a top Romney surrogate, suggested in a conference call with reporters that Obama doesn't understand how the U.S. economy works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish this president would learn how to be an American,&quot; Sununu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later offered a clarification: &quot;What I thought I said, but what I didn't say, is the president has to learn the American formula for creating business.&quot;          </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political pressure on Mitt Romney to release more of his personal income tax returns is causing some divisions inside the GOP presidential candidate's camp, according to a Republican strategist close to the campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although some advisers are arguing privately that Romney needs to release additional filings to curb the political fallout, others are resisting that suggestion, reflecting the candidate's longtime reluctance to publicly disclose information about his personal finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to Romney, would not discuss internal debate about strategy but said there is only one opinion that matters in the internal strategy debate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The final voice on this is the governor's, and he's made it very clear that the two years that he's provided represent going above and beyond what's required to be disclosed,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about his taxes in a telephone interview Tuesday with National Review Online, Romney said: &quot;The opposition research of the Obama campaign is looking for anything they can use to distract from the failure of the president to reignite our economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;And I'm simply not enthusiastic about giving them hundreds or thousands of more pages to pick through, distort and lie about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Tuesday, after the interview with Romney, the editors of the National Review wrote an editorial arguing that the only question for Romney is &quot;whether he releases more returns now, or later - after playing more defense on the issue and sustaining more hits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial adds to a growing chorus of Romney allies urging him to make the additional information public. In response to a reporter's question at the State Capitol in Austin, Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) also urged his former White House rival to be &quot;as transparent as you can be,&quot; although he appeared to stop short of calling on Romney to disclose more information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax issue took center stage Tuesday in a campaign that has grown more acrimonious by the day, and Romney maintained that he would not release more than just the past two years of tax returns because he does not want to give the Obama campaign ammunition to attack him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason for Romney's reluctance is his belief that he will not be able to provide enough information to satisfy his critics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It'll never be enough,&quot; Madden said. &quot;If you release 10, they'll want 20. If you release 20, they'll want 25, and whatever's in there will be open to their distortions and their dishonest attacks.&quot; The campaign has pointed to the fact that GOP nominee John McCain released only two years of returns during the 2008 campaign; Democrats have countered that McCain was the only one of the past seven White House challengers to release just two years of documents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Republicans say Romney's refusal to release the tax returns is beginning to cost him politically. &quot;Perception is becoming Romney's reality, and these issues have now risen above mere distractions,&quot; said GOP consultant John Weaver, a senior adviser for McCain's 2000 and 2008 bids. &quot;The president has had the worst three months of any incumbent, due to the economy, since George H.W. Bush in 1992, and yet Romney has lost traction among key demographic groups in the vital swing states. He has got to get this behind him or he's going to face summer definition a la [Bob] Dole and [John] Kerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign began running a new tax-themed campaign ad in Pennsylvania on Tuesday and appears ready to continue pummeling Romney on the tax issue, with or without the release of his returns. The ad speculates that the former Massachusetts governor's reluctance &quot;makes you wonder if some years he paid any taxes at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the Republicans jumping into the tax fray this week have been Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.), who told Politico on Tuesday that he thinks Romney should release more of his returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News Channel's Brit Hume weighed in on the matter Monday night, telling host Bill O'Reilly, &quot;I don't see any evidence that this is making a difference, but you know, anytime it's disclosure versus non-disclosure, you always wonder whether it isn't better to just put it out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two join Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R), former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour (R), and conservative commentators George F. Will and William Kristol in suggesting that the best move for Romney is to release the information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight over Romney's tax returns is part of a battle being waged by the candidates to control the turf on which the broader campaign is to play out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Obama, the goal is to focus on Romney's private-sector background - a point on which the president hammered his GOP rival at a fundraiser Tuesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's &quot;main calling card for wanting to be president is his private-sector experience, so we asked the voters to examine that experience,&quot; Obama said at his first fundraiser of the day, at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio, where he addressed a luncheon crowd of 1,200, including many Latino supporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a rally in Pennsylvania, Romney seized on a remark Obama made during a campaign stop in Virginia last week to make his case that the president is ill-equipped to fix the country's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said this: 'If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen,' &quot; Romney told the 700-member crowd at Horizontal Wireline, referring to Obama. &quot;That somebody else is government, in his view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney added that he thinks the president wants Americans to be &quot;ashamed of success&quot; and that Obama is &quot;changing the nature of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find it extraordinary that a philosophy of that nature would be spoken by a president of the United States,&quot; Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just as the messaging battle has ramped up, so, too, have some of the envelope-pushing attacks from both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the Obama campaign released a hard-hitting ad that appeared to question Romney's patriotism and featured footage of the candidate singing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, former New Hampshire governor John Sununu (R), a top Romney surrogate, suggested in a conference call with reporters that Obama doesn't understand how the U.S. economy works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish this president would learn how to be an American,&quot; Sununu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later offered a clarification: &quot;What I thought I said, but what I didn't say, is the president has to learn the American formula for creating business.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CINCINNATI -- President Obama and Mitt Romney escalated their running battle over capitalism, integrity and the economy on Monday as each sought to portray the other as part of the nation's problem rather than its solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a freewheeling town-hall-style meeting with supporters here, Mr. Obama took aim at Mr. Romney's corporate tax proposals, saying they would create jobs overseas rather than at home. Mr. Romney's campaign accused Mr. Obama of ''crony capitalism'' by using government resources to reward donors at the expense of the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sharp exchanges came after a week in which the president's campaign pounded away at Mr. Romney over business deals at the Boston-based private equity firm he founded and over his refusal to release more than two years of his personal tax returns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In focusing on his opponent's tax policies on Monday, Mr. Obama tried to cement the impression of an out-of-touch tycoon, while Mr. Romney tried to get off the defensive by questioning the president's ethics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We don't need a president who plans to ship more jobs overseas or wants to give more tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas,'' Mr. Obama told supporters at Cincinnati Music Hall in this important swing state. ''I want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in Ohio, that are investing in Cincinnati, that are investing in Hamilton County. I want to give incentives to companies that are investing in you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama cited a study saying that Mr. Romney's plan to eliminate taxes on foreign income earned by corporations would create 800,000 jobs. ''There's only one problem,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The jobs wouldn't be in America.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, published in the journal Tax Notes by Kimberly A. Clausing, a professor at Reed College, argued that those overseas jobs could offset jobs at home. ''With high unemployment rates, why further tilt the playing field in favor of jobs in low-tax countries?'' she wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans said the study was conducted by a professor from a well-known liberal college who contributed money to Mr. Obama's campaign and to other Democrats. They also pointed out that the policy she and Mr. Obama oppose is actually supported by members of the president's jobs advisory council and export advisory council. It was also supported by Mr. Obama's own bipartisan commission on reducing the national debt, led by Alan K. Simpson, a former Republican senator, and Erskine B. Bowles, a former Clinton White House chief of staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporations argue that eliminating taxes on foreign income, a policy called a ''territorial tax system,'' would encourage them to repatriate that money and invest it in the United States. ''A territorial tax system should be adopted to help put the U.S. system in line with other countries, leveling the playing field,'' the Simpson-Bowles commission concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jennifer R. Psaki, an Obama spokeswoman, said Professor Clausing was a ''well-respected economist'' and brushed off the fact that Mr. Obama's own advisers disagreed with him on the issue. ''Of course the president receives a range of advice from outside advisory boards,'' she said, ''but the only view that matters is the president's. And he thinks this is the wrong approach.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, who held no public campaign events on Monday, authorized a new Web video asserting that Mr. Obama has steered money and payoffs to political supporters. The video shows headlines from news organizations as Mr. Obama sings the opening verse from ''Let's Stay Together'' in the background, a response to an Obama campaign ad released Saturday featuring Mr. Romney singing ''America the Beautiful.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the headlines shown in the latest Romney&nbsp;ad: ''Report: Obama's big-money raisers get key posts, access, stimulus dollars,'' and ''Democratic donors rewarded with W.H. perks.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Mr. Romney's campaign said: ''Middle-class families are struggling in the Obama economy. Instead of working to restore their economic security, President Obama is too busy rewarding his biggest donors. The Obama record is one of political payoffs and middle-class layoffs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Psaki said Mr. Romney was ''treading on thin ice here,'' noting that the president has released information that Mr. Romney has refused to. ''President Obama has set a bar of transparency that Mitt Romney has not met, cannot possibly meet, even on his tippy toes,'' Ms. Psaki said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Gillespie, a senior Romney adviser, said Mr. Obama was trying to distract voters from a string of disappointing jobs reports with ''shiny objects'' -- meaning the attacks on Mr. Romney's business record. The Romney campaign's response will be to call out Mr. Obama's ''Chicago-style politics and Chicago-style economics,'' Mr. Gillespie told reporters on a conference call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's event here, cast as his first town-hall-style meeting of the campaign, was animated at times. The heavy topics were leavened by lighter moments. A barber asked if he could cut Mr. Obama's hair, but the president declined. ''You would not want a president who was disloyal to his barber,'' he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's say you are president in a time of a sustained economic slowdown. You initiated a series of big policies that you thought were going to turn the economy around, but they didn't work -- either because they were insufficient or ineffective. How do you run for re-election under these circumstances?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you spend the entire campaign saying that things would have been even worse if you hadn't acted the way you did? No. That would be pathetic. You go on the attack. Instead of defending your economic policies, you attack modern capitalism as it now exists. You blame the system for the economy. You do this with double ferocity if your opponent happens to be the embodiment of that system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what the Obama campaign appears to have done in recent months. Instead of defending the policies of the last four years, the campaign has begun a series of attacks on the things people don't like about modern capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They don't like the way unsuccessful firms go bust. Obama hit that with ads about a steel plant closure a few months ago. They don't like C.E.O. salaries. President Obama hits that regularly. They don't like financial shenanigans. Obama hits that. They don't like outsourcing and offshoring. This week, Obama has been hitting that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president is now running an ad showing Mitt Romney tunelessly singing ''America the Beautiful,'' while the text on screen blasts him for shipping jobs to China, India and Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accuracy of the ad has been questioned by the various fact-checking outfits. That need not detain us. It's safest to assume that all the ads you see this year will be at least somewhat inaccurate because the ad-makers now take dishonesty as a mark of their professional toughness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What matters is the ideology behind the ad: the assumption that Bain Capital, the private-equity firm founded by Romney, should not have invested in companies that hired workers abroad; the assumption that hiring Mexican or Indian workers is unpatriotic; the assumption that no worthy person would do what most global business leaders have been doing for the past half-century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ad -- and the rhetoric the campaign is using around it -- challenges the entire logic of capitalism as it has existed over several decades. It's part of a comprehensive attack on the economic system Romney personifies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This shift of focus has been audacious. Over the years of his presidency, Obama has not been a critic of globalization. There's no real evidence that, when he's off the campaign trail, he has any problem with outsourcing and offshoring. He has lavishly praised people like Steve Jobs who were prominent practitioners. He has hired people like Jeffrey Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, whose company embodies the upsides of globalization. His economic advisers have generally touted the benefits of globalization even as they worked to help those who are hurt by its downsides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, politically, this aggressive tactic has worked. It has shifted the focus of the race from being about big government, which Obama represents, to being about capitalism, which Romney represents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as Republicans spent years promising voters that they could have tax cuts forever, now the Democrats are promising voters that they can have all the benefits of capitalism without the downsides, like plant closures, rich C.E.O.'s and outsourcing. Just as Republicans used to force Democrats into the eat-your-spinach posture (you need to have high taxes if you want your programs), now Democrats are casting Republicans into the eat-your-spinach posture (you need to accept outsourcing and the pains of creative destruction if you want your prosperity).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign doesn't seem to know how to respond. For centuries, business leaders have been inept when writers, intellectuals and politicians attacked capitalism, and, so far, the Romney campaign is continuing that streak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing is for sure. As Arthur Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute has said again and again, it's not enough to say that capitalism will make you money. You can't fight what is essentially a moral critique with economics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney is going to have to define a vision of modern capitalism. He's going to have to separate his vision from the scandals and excesses we've seen over the last few years. He needs to define the kind of capitalist he is and why the country needs his virtues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's face it, he's not a heroic entrepreneur. He's an efficiency expert. It has been the business of his life to take companies that were mediocre and sclerotic and try to make them efficient and dynamic. It has been his job to be the corporate version of a personal trainer: take people who are puffy and self-indulgent and whip them into shape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's his selling point: rigor and productivity. If he can build a capitalist vision around that, he'll thrive. If not, he's a punching bag.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Obama campaign released a critical ad featuring Mr. Romney singing &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; set against headlines with outsourcing claims, the Romney campaign returned fire with a Web video of its own, mocking Mr. Obama's rendition of Al Green's &quot;Let's Stay Together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet hours after the Romney&nbsp;ad hit YouTube, it was taken down with a message from the site:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad originally featured audio of Mr. Obama singing Al Green's 1972 hit at a January fund-raising event, juxtaposing lyrics from the song with claims of favoritism to lobbyists and donors. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the outsourcing noose tightening around Mitt Romney's neck, or is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee being unfairly accused of having headed a venture capital company that put profits ahead of preserving American jobs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign's charge that Bain Capital, the Boston-based firm Romney founded, controlled businesses that outsourced thousands of U.S. jobs to Australia, Asia and Europe has hurt the GOP candidate, according to polls of voters in several battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Romney, who says that as president he'll be the job-creator-in-chief for Americans, claims he left Bain in February 1999 to run the U.S. Olympics Committee, before the outsourcing began. The Obama campaign has countered with a television ad that says under Romney's leadership, Bain actually pioneered the outsourcing of American jobs. Each campaign has accused the other of lying. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who's telling the truth?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's certain is that an odor of mendacity pollutes the air of this political season. And, with so much stock being placed in this ugly war of words, the outcome of the presidential election could turn on the exposure of the fabulist in this matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That might not be easily done. Though The Boston Globe has uncovered Securities and Exchange Commission documents that show that Bain said Romney was the company's &quot;sole stockholder, chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president&quot; until 2002, the GOP presidential candidate says he played no role in the running of the company after 1999. His denial comes even as the newspaper uncovered a Massachusetts financial disclosure form in which Romney reported that he earned executive compensation from the firm in 2001 and 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seizing on this issue, the Obama campaign started airing some hard-hitting television ads in battleground states that appear to have chipped away at Romney's support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dueling TV ads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's campaign responded with a TV ad that calls the president a liar, a claim  supported by The Washington Post. Its Fact Checker column concluded after examining the documents the Globe uncovered &quot;that Romney essentially left Bain in 1999&quot; and played no part in  outsourcing  U.S. jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But PolitiFact.com, the Tampa Bay Times' Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-checking column, disagreed. The &quot;exact month that Romney stepped away from Bain makes little difference,&quot; it concluded this month.  The outsourcing decisions that came after he purportedly left his  firm were &quot;the kind of move Romney and Bain expected&quot; when they invested in companies that sought to increase their profits by moving jobs to countries with lower labor costs, PolitiFact.com said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this issue,  Romney should cut and run. When a company says  as unequivocally as Bain did  that Romney was its chairman, CEO and president until 2002, it fails the laugh test for anyone to argue otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe he delegated most of his day-to-day decision-making during the years he was running the U.S. Olympics Committee, but he was the captain of Bain's ship, even if he wasn't on the bridge. And it's not as though he was averse to outsourcing, since the contract to produce uniforms for the 2002 Olympics team was given to a Canadian company while he was away from Bain running that operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to outsourcing, Romney would do well to change the subject. The more he tries to answer the Obama campaign's attack ads, the more damage he's going to do to his hopes of ever getting into the Oval Office without an invitation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             CINCINNATI - President Obama used an hour-long town hall event here Monday to mock Republican Mitt Romney's economic plan as one that would create jobs only overseas, as the two candidates continued to trade insults in a presidential campaign that has turned increasingly bitter in recent days.          Speaking at the Cincinnati Music Hall, Obama cited a new study that found that Romney's support of a territorial tax system - in which U.S. companies are not taxed on their overseas profits - would create 800,000 jobs outside the country.            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's only one problem: The jobs wouldn't be in America,&quot; Obama told 1,200 supporters, referring to the report in Tax Notes, a nonprofit, nonpartisan publication.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who has proposed tax breaks for companies that bring jobs back to the United States, added that &quot;we don't need a president who plans to ship more jobs overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's latest broadside aimed to keep Romney on the defensive over accusations that he supported the practice of offshoring jobs while he oversaw Bain Capital, a private-equity firm. Those charges, which Romney disputes, have allowed Obama to shift the focus of the debate from the sluggish economy to his rival's record in the private sector and have ramped up GOP pressure on the former Massachusetts governor to mount an effective rebuttal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans dismissed the Tax Notes report, pointing out that members of Obama's jobs council have supported a territorial tax as a way to stimulate economic growth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters in Baton Rouge, where Romney was appearing at an intimate fundraiser, senior campaign adviser Eric Fehrnstrom lashed out at the Obama campaign, likening it to a &quot;bottomless pit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every day, they reach a new low,&quot; he said. &quot;When you hear a false and dishonest attack from the Obama campaign, ask yourself this question: What does this have to do with creating more jobs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has defended himself by insisting that Bain did not invest in companies that sent jobs abroad until after he gave up daily management of the company in 1999. But the Obama campaign has seized on media reports that Bain continued to list Romney as chief executive three years later in filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney said in Louisiana on Monday that he would not &quot;apologize for being a successful businessman&quot; in the face of the attacks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who take risks sometimes succeed brilliantly, wonderfully, and that makes us a stronger economy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's campaign distributed a memo Monday morning that suggested that the Bain attacks were falling flat, not affecting polling even as Obama has heavily outspent his rival on television ads in swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no evidence to suggest that the ballot has moved,&quot; Neil Newhouse, Romney's pollster, wrote in the memo. &quot;If throwing the kitchen sink at Gov. Romney while leveraging a two-to-one ad-spending advantage doesn't move numbers for the President, that's got to tell you something about the state of the electorate: Voters are frustrated with President Obama's failure to keep his promises from the 2008 campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's latest broadside also drew an angry response from Romney's Republican allies on Capitol Hill. GOP aides distributed an article by the conservative Weekly Standard that said the Tax Notes report was prepared by a professor at Reed College in Portland, Ore., who has donated exclusively to Obama and Democrats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That disclosure played directly into the hands of the Romney camp, which on Monday tried to move past the Bain debate by launching a new offensive against Obama for what it called &quot;crony capitalism.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to about 40 donors at his fundraising event, Romney again raised the example of Fisker Automotive, a California manufacturer of hybrid electric cars that has received government loans and recently laid off some workers. The company's investors include a firm that counts former Democratic vice president Al Gore as a partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is taking your tax dollars and putting it in businesses owned by contributors to his campaign, and that is smelly at best. It stinks,&quot; Romney told his supporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's trip to Cincinnati came just 10 days after he wrapped up a two-day tour of Ohio, considered a crucial bellwether for both campaigns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although both sides think the race will be tight, polls show Obama holding a small but steady advantage in Ohio and other swing states. His campaign has outspent Romney by $91 million to $23 million on television ads in those battlegrounds.  Romney, who also has made several appearances in the state, will return to Ohio for a campaign event Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">778 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As his campaign threw out unsubstantiated charges that Mitt Romney might be guilty of a felony, and then mocked Romney's off-key singing of &quot;America the Beautiful,&quot; President Obama took a moment to reflect on the sad state of America's political tone. &quot;Washington feels as broken as it did four years ago,&quot; he explained. &quot;And if you ask me what is the one thing that has frustrated me most over the last four years, it's not the hard work. It's not the enormity of the decisions. It's not the pace. It is that I haven't been able to change the atmosphere here in Washington to reflect the decency and common sense of ordinary people.&quot;           The problem is real enough. Extreme political polarization is the product of democracy that undermines democracy. It increases incivility and magnifies distrust of government. It causes some to abandon civic engagement in disgust, and others to join angry ideological insurrections. In Congress, it adds to the obstructive power of cohesive partisan blocs and makes bargaining and compromise in the public interest more difficult.            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do politicians cause this polarization or merely reflect it? There are plenty of contributing factors they don't control. The public itself has become more partisan over the past few decades. Both parties have become more ideologically homogeneous (though Democrats still have more internal diversity). The growth of partisan media has fed polarization. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But leaders can oppose this trend or contribute to it. Things get worse when Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.) claims there are &quot;about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party that are members of the Communist Party.&quot; Or when Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) says that Republicans &quot;want to literally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws.&quot; Politicians can legitimize incivility, contempt and conspiracy theories. One academic calls such leaders &quot;polarization entrepreneurs.&quot; They increase their status and influence by feeding partisan division.           Whatever his intentions or provocations, Obama is now engaged in partisan polarization on an industrial scale. His campaign's latest round of Bain charges is not politics as usual. It is the accusation of criminal impropriety - the filing of false government documents - without real evidence, as various fact-checking outfits have attested. Obama's recent attack ad, &quot;Firms,&quot; reflects the sensibilities of a particularly nasty 13-year-old. It is difficult to imagine most Americans saying: &quot;That's just what American politics most needs - more juvenile viciousness.&quot;           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are not excesses; they are the essence of Obama's current political strategy. He is attempting to destroy Romney before Romney can define himself, while using a series of issues - the mini-DREAM Act, voting rights and contraceptive controversies - to excite his base. The approach is not politically irrational. But it is premised on the avoidance of issues such as unemployment and the deficit. And it leaves little room for complaints about the brokenness of Washington. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will this strategy succeed? So far, it hasn't seemed to change the fundamental dynamics of the race, a race that remains both very close and remarkably stable. Negative charges usually work when they have the ring of truth, and Romney - though he has his weaknesses as a candidate - does not fit the part of a sleazy businessman or a Nixonian liar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these tactics do have an effect on politics. The most partisan Democrats are encouraged and empowered. The most partisan Republicans gain an excuse for the next  escalation. This is the nature of polarization: Both sides feel victimized, which becomes a justification to cross past limits and boundaries. Neither side feels responsible for the problem, while both contribute to it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and his political team have a history of viewing themselves as superior to Washington and the &quot;Beltway mentality.&quot; The president combines a feeling of superiority to politics with a determination to beat his opponents at their own grubby game. It allows him to view himself as a pure, transformative figure while employing the tactics of a Chicago pol. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also one reason, according to Gallup, the gap between partisans' approval ratings of Obama has been &quot;historically high.&quot; This does not mean the GOP bears no responsibility. It only means Obama has made Washington more broken and continues to make it more broken - both responding to grievances and creating new reasons for grievance. Meanwhile, America is well on its way to a disturbing destination: A nation with the responsibilities of a superpower and the politics of a banana republic. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney said in Louisiana on Monday that he would not &quot;apologize for being a successful businessman&quot; in the face of the attacks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who take risks sometimes succeed brilliantly, wonderfully, and that makes us a stronger economy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's campaign distributed a memo Monday morning that suggested that the Bain attacks were falling flat, not affecting polling even as Obama has heavily outspent his rival on television ads in swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no evidence to suggest that the ballot has moved,&quot; Neil Newhouse, Romney's pollster, wrote in the memo. &quot;If throwing the kitchen sink at Gov. Romney while leveraging a two-to-one ad-spending advantage doesn't move numbers for the President, that's got to tell you something about the state of the electorate: Voters are frustrated with President Obama's failure to keep his promises from the 2008 campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's latest broadside also drew an angry response from Romney's Republican allies on Capitol Hill. GOP aides distributed an article by the conservative Weekly Standard that said the Tax Notes report was prepared by a professor at Reed College in Portland, Ore., who has donated exclusively to Obama and Democrats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That disclosure played directly into the hands of the Romney camp, which on Monday tried to move past the Bain debate by launching a new offensive against Obama for what it called &quot;crony capitalism.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to about 40 donors at his fundraising event, Romney again raised the example of Fisker Automotive, a California manufacturer of hybrid electric cars that has received government loans and recently laid off some workers. The company's investors include a firm that counts former Democratic vice president Al Gore as a partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is taking your tax dollars and putting it in businesses owned by contributors to his campaign, and that is smelly at best. It stinks,&quot; Romney told his supporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's trip to Cincinnati came just 10 days after he wrapped up a two-day tour of Ohio, considered a crucial bellwether for both campaigns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although both sides think the race will be tight, polls show Obama holding a small but steady advantage in Ohio and other swing states. His campaign has outspent Romney by $91 million to $23 million on television ads in those battlegrounds.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, who also has made several appearances in the state, will return to Ohio for a campaign event Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As his campaign threw out unsubstantiated charges that Mitt Romney might be guilty of a felony, and then mocked Romney's off-key singing of &quot;America the Beautiful,&quot; President Obama took a moment to reflect on the sad state of America's political tone. &quot;Washington feels as broken as it did four years ago,&quot; he explained. &quot;And if you ask me what is the one thing that has frustrated me most over the last four years, it's not the hard work. It's not the enormity of the decisions. It's not the pace. It is that I haven't been able to change the atmosphere here in Washington to reflect the decency and common sense of ordinary people.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is real enough. Extreme political polarization is the product of democracy that undermines democracy. It increases incivility and magnifies distrust of government. It causes some to abandon civic engagement in disgust, and others to join angry ideological insurrections. In Congress, it adds to the obstructive power of cohesive partisan blocs and makes bargaining and compromise in the public interest more difficult.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do politicians cause this polarization or merely reflect it? There are plenty of contributing factors they don't control. The public itself has become more partisan over the past few decades. Both parties have become more ideologically homogeneous (though Democrats still have more internal diversity). The growth of partisan media has fed polarization. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But leaders can oppose this trend or contribute to it. Things get worse when Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.) claims there are &quot;about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party that are members of the Communist Party.&quot; Or when Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) says that Republicans &quot;want to literally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws.&quot; Politicians can legitimize incivility, contempt and conspiracy theories. One academic calls such leaders &quot;polarization entrepreneurs.&quot; They increase their status and influence by feeding partisan division. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever his intentions or provocations, Obama is now engaged in partisan polarization on an industrial scale. His campaign's latest round of Bain charges is not politics as usual. It is the accusation of criminal impropriety - the filing of false government documents - without real evidence, as various fact-checking outfits have attested. Obama's recent attack ad, &quot;Firms,&quot; reflects the sensibilities of a particularly nasty 13-year-old. It is difficult to imagine most Americans saying: &quot;That's just what American politics most needs - more juvenile viciousness.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are not excesses; they are the essence of Obama's current political strategy. He is attempting to destroy Romney before Romney can define himself, while using a series of issues - the mini-DREAM Act, voting rights and contraceptive controversies - to excite his base. The approach is not politically irrational. But it is premised on the avoidance of issues such as unemployment and the deficit. And it leaves little room for complaints about the brokenness of Washington. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will this strategy succeed? So far, it hasn't seemed to change the fundamental dynamics of the race, a race that remains both very close and remarkably stable. Negative charges usually work when they have the ring of truth, and Romney - though he has his weaknesses as a candidate - does not fit the part of a sleazy businessman or a Nixonian liar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these tactics do have an effect on politics. The most partisan Democrats are encouraged and empowered. The most partisan Republicans gain an excuse for the next  escalation. This is the nature of polarization: Both sides feel victimized, which becomes a justification to cross past limits and boundaries. Neither side feels responsible for the problem, while both contribute to it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and his political team have a history of viewing themselves as superior to Washington and the &quot;Beltway mentality.&quot; The president combines a feeling of superiority to politics with a determination to beat his opponents at their own grubby game. It allows him to view himself as a pure, transformative figure while employing the tactics of a Chicago pol. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also one reason, according to Gallup, the gap between partisans' approval ratings of Obama has been &quot;historically high.&quot; This does not mean the GOP bears no responsibility. It only means Obama has made Washington more broken and continues to make it more broken - both responding to grievances and creating new reasons for grievance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, America is well on its way to a disturbing destination: A nation with the responsibilities of a superpower and the politics of a banana republic. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three days of Mitt Romney complaining about attacks on his record at Bain Capital, it's clear that President Obama has nothing to apologize for. If Mr. Romney doesn't want to provide real answers to the questions about his career, he had better develop a thicker skin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's descriptions of when he left Bain have been erratic and self-serving. In 2002, when he needed to show he was still a Massachusetts resident, he denied he had quit in 1999, saying he had taken a leave of absence to run the Olympics committee. A series of documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Committee show that Bain certainly didn't describe him as absent after 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Bain managing director, Edward Conard, said on MSNBC Sunday that Mr. Romney remained C.E.O. ''legally'' so he could negotiate his generous exit deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now that Bain has been accused of helping other companies outsource jobs overseas, laying off steel company employees and wiping out their pensions, Mr. Romney says he had no management role after 1999. A Kansas City steel plant that Bain bought in 1993 under Mr. Romney's control, for example, went bankrupt in 2001, costing 750 workers their jobs and pensions. After the Obama campaign made an ad featuring several of the angry workers, the Romney campaign said he couldn't be blamed because he left Bain in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, a Boston Globe article demonstrated Mr. Romney's continuing ties to Bain through 2002, and Mr. Obama said it raised questions for his opponent. ''I think most Americans figure if you are the chairman, C.E.O. and president of a company,'' he said, ''you are responsible for what that company does.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign aides did go too far, perhaps, in suggesting Mr. Romney may have legal problems over this issue. But Mr. Obama's criticism is fair. Mr. Romney has persistently refused to tell voters about his finances. Even now it is not clear how much money he has made from Bain in the 13 (or 10) years since he left the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right way to respond to Mr. Obama is to release his tax returns from that period, or open up Bain documents. But Mr. Romney told CNN he would not release more than the one year's return he has already released and the one for 2011 when it is finished. ''That's all that's necessary for people to understand something about my finances,'' he said. It's not even close.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In a memo released on Monday, Mitt Romney's campaign argues that even after being outspent by the Obama campaign more than two to one, the race between the two men remains increasingly close. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WOLFEBORO, N.H. - Mitt Romney spent the weekend with his family on Lake Winnipesaukee under assault by President Obama and his top surrogates, who hammered him with accusations that his old company shipped American jobs overseas and continued demanding that he release more back tax returns. But on Monday morning, Mr. Romney's campaign struck back with a message of its own: We're not particularly impressed with Team Obama just yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In &quot;The State of The Race: Ballot Narrowing Despite Obama Attack Ads,&quot; a memo released on Monday morning by Mr. Romney's pollster, Neil Newhouse,&nbsp;&nbsp;Romney campaign officials argued that even after the Obama campaign outspent them more than two to one, the race between the two men is increasingly close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing three recent polls - Rasmussen, Gallup and McClatchy/Marist - which either show Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney tied or have Mr. Obama up by a two-point margin, the memo mentions the Obama campaign's spate of negative advertising and asks: &quot;What has that bought the Democrats? A closer race - Obama has slipped and support for Gov. Romney has increased.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This memo, combined with a new, more aggressive posture on the stump that Mr. Romney plans to introduce on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, represents a concerted effort by the Romney campaign to reclaim the narrative of fixing the economy and to turn the heat back on the president. The initiative, dubbed &quot;Obama's Political Payoffs Versus Middle Class Layoffs,&quot; will contrast the suffering of middle-class Americans with Obama donors who the Romney campaign claims have received special favors, and comes in response to a series of attacks by the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, the Obama campaign released a new television ad that features Mr. Romney singing a warbling, off-key version of &quot;American the Beautiful&quot; while accusing him of having shipped American jobs overseas. The attack was part of a recent onslaught by Mr. Obama's team intended to paint Mr. Romney as wealthy and out of touch,&nbsp; by turning the focus to the former governor's tax returns and time at the helm of Bain Capital, the private equity firm he helped found. Over the weekend, Mr. Obama crisscrossed Virginia, attacking Mr. Romney's business record, a point his aides hammered home on the Sunday television talk shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign, meanwhile, pointed to other polls showing that its ads are cutting away at Mr. Romney's credibility on the economy, a central theme of his campaign, and said Mr. Romney was &quot;desperate to change the conversation and avoid very serious questions about his tenure as a corporate buyout specialist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But as public polls have shown, the more voters learn about [Mr. Romney's] record of leading investments in firms that were pioneers of outsourcing and investing in foreign tax havens and offshore accounts, the less they trust him,&quot; wrote Lis Smith, an Obama campaign spokeswoman, in an e-mailed statement. &quot;It's time for him to come clean and follow decades of precedent by releasing multiple years of tax returns so that voters can learn about his motivations on critical policy initiatives and whether he used his offshore accounts to hedge against the dollar or avoid U.S. taxes. Until then, we're left wondering just what he is hiding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite calls from conservatives, including many donors and supporters, to respond more aggressively, the Romney campaign has chosen largely not to play defense and hit back, saying it would not respond until any damage could be seen in its internal polling. The campaign's outward attitude, at least for now, seems to take a page from the Mad magazine-Alfred E. Neuman school of thought: What, me worry?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's campaign will never have a more substantial advertising advantage than it has had over the past few weeks, yet there is no evidence to suggest that the ballot has moved,&quot; Mr. Newhouse wrote in his memo, in a section titled &quot;Bottom Line.&quot; &quot;If throwing the kitchen sink at Gov. Romney while leveraging a two-to-one ad-spending advantage doesn't move numbers for the President, that's got to tell you something about the state of the electorate: Voters are frustrated with President Obama's failure to keep his promises from the 2008 campaign and don't truly believe the next four years will be any different from the last three and a half.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the actions of Mr. Romney's campaign belie the unconcerned tone of the memo. On Friday, in a hastily scheduled round of television interviews, Mr. Romney pushed back on the charges that he had remained the figurehead at Bain for several years after 1999 - the year he says he left the firm - and demanded an apology from the president. And this week's sharper tone, accusing Mr. Obama of &quot;systematic favoritism&quot; and steering taxpayer dollars into the pockets of his campaign donors, represents an escalation of Mr. Romney's usual stump speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With long-term unemployment at record levels, incomes and net worth down, and the middle class struggling, we don't need four more years of political payoffs, taxpayer giveaways, and cronyism,&quot; a Romney aide wrote in an e-mail, in a preview of what the campaign plans to focus on this week. &quot;We need a plan to fix our economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney sought to change the topic in the presidential campaign on Monday with a Web video accusing President Obama of caring more about his donors and friends than the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as he complains about what he calls &quot;disgusting&quot; personal attacks by the president's team, Mr. Romney says in the new video that Mr. Obama has spent his years in the White House steering money and payoffs to his political supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video shows headlines from news organizations as the viewer hears Mr. Obama singing the opening verse from &quot;Let's Stay to Together&quot; in the background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Report: Obama's big-money raisers get key posts, access, stimulus dollars,&quot; says one headline from National Public Radio.<BR><BR>Another headline read: &quot;Democratic donors rewarded with W.H. perks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a news release accompanying the release of the video, Mr. Romney's campaign attacked Mr. Obama's actions in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Middle class families are struggling in the Obama economy,&quot; the campaign wrote. &quot;Instead of working to restore their economic security, President Obama is too busy rewarding his biggest donors. The Obama record is one of political payoffs and middle class layoffs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new video released is similar to an ad the Obama campaign released on Saturday featuring Mr. Romney singing &quot;America the Beautiful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new video comes after more than a week of stinging attacks from Mr. Obama's campaign on the issue of whether Mr. Romney is responsible for Bain Capital's investments in companies that have been accused of outsourcing American jobs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those attacks prompted the Republican candidate to complain vigorously that the president is making unwarranted personal attacks. In a series of five interviews on the cable and television networks on Friday, Mr. Romney called for an apology from the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday morning, Kevin Madden, a senior adviser for Mr. Romney, complained about the direction of the discussion from the president's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you are seeing right now is an American public who wants to talk about the issues,&quot; he said on the MSNBC program, &quot;Morning Joe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another senior adviser to Mr. Romney, Ed Gillespie, pointing to the recent string of poor job reports, accused Mr. Obama of trying to distract voters with &quot;shiny objects'' -- meaning the attacks on Mr. Romney's record at Bain.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign's response in the next few days will be to call out Mr. Obama's &quot;Chicago-style politics and Chicago-style economics,'' Mr. Gillespie told reporters on a conference call Monday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to be highlighting some of these examples of how the Obama economy works,'' Mr. Gillespie said. For any voters tuned in during the political doldrum days of mid-July, they can expect to hear more about Solyndra, &quot;crony capitalism&quot; and other examples of how the Romney campaign says &quot;political appointees in Washington, D.C., are making decisions about where investments go and where taxpayer dollars go based on donor connections.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, who spent the weekend at his vacation home in New Hampshire, has a relatively light schedule of campaigning this week, with appearances scheduled near Pittsburgh on Tuesday and in Ohio on Wednesday.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Is Building Criminal Cases in Rate-Fixing &nbsp;|&nbsp; As regulators ramp up their global investigation into the manipulation of interest rates, the Justice Department has identified potential criminal wrongdoing by big banks and individuals at the center of the scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department's criminal division is building cases against several financial institutions and their employees, including traders at Barclays, the British bank, according to government officials close to the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing. The authorities expect to file charges against at least one bank later this year, one of the officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of criminal cases is expected to rattle the banking world and provide a new impetus for financial institutions to settle with the authorities. The Justice Department investigation comes on top of private investor lawsuits and a sweeping regulatory inquiry led by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Collectively, the civil and criminal actions could cost the banking industry tens of billions of dollars. DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mitt Romney's hypocritical attack on the president's love for his &quot;donor class.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration, like its predecessors, has been far too generous to its &quot;bundlers&quot; - the fundraisers who solicit donations from their friends and colleagues and assemble them in a very green bouquet for the campaign. The bundlers expect something in return and they frequently get it, whether it is recognition, access to the White House, or government contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mike McIntire and Michael Luo of The Times reported in April, two-thirds of President Obama's top fund-raisers in 2008 have visited the White House, and not on the public tour. They were there to do business and twist a few arms. Four dozen bundlers were invited to a state dinner with the British prime minister, and two sat at the head table.<BR><BR>The Center for Public Integrity found that about 200 Obama bundlers had won federal jobs or appointed posts, attended elite White House meetings, or won federal contracts. (Two dozen became ambassadors.) That's about the same as during the administration of George W. Bush, though over eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, to deflect attention from its troubles with Bain Capital, the Romney campaign is hyperventilating over that coziness, as if it is unprecedented. A new ad claims that Mr. Obama loves his &quot;donor class&quot; more than the middle class, and is showering them with favors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how did the Romney campaign, and the reports it relied on, know who the Obama bundlers were? Because the Obama campaign disclosed them, though it is not required to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's something the Romney campaign has refused to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to the campaign, told reporters today that it has no plans to ever disclose those fund-raisers, just as it is stonewalling on a full release of Mr. Romney's tax returns. (The stone wall encircles the whole party, apparently; Republican senators will also vote later today to filibuster the Disclose Act, which would require releasing the names of big donors to secretive political groups.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not hard to guess why the bundlers will remain secret, since such a list would show just how dependent the Romney campaign is on the financial sector, which is not beloved among voters. USA Today recently pieced together a partial list of about 1,200 of those bundlers, showing that a quarter came from finance, and more than a dozen from Goldman Sachs alone. If you're bored with investment banking and want to be considered for Mr. Romney's ambassador to Luxembourg or Lichtenstein, better start bundling now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Favoritism is a bad business, a stain on every administration that has allowed money to dictate its decisions. But an ad like Mr. Romney's, encompassing hypocrisy, deceit and secrecy, may be even worse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week after President Obama came under fire for another disappointing unemployment report, his team has succeeded in turning the focus of the 2012 campaign from jobs in general to a particular job: the one Mitt Romney was or wasn't doing for Bain Capital from 1999 to 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The substance of the dispute is surely a muddle to many voters. Independent fact-checking organizations including FactCheck.org and media outlets such as The Boston Globe are at odds over whether Romney can fairly be held responsible for Bain's decisions   at that time, some of which contributed to  outsourcing   jobs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the political impact of the heated exchanges over that question seem clear. While the attacks open Obama to the charge that he is just another pol -- not the agent of hope and change from his 2008 bid -- the costs to Romney are more serious. Debate about his tenure at Bain has tarnished his business credentials and distracted him from the economic issues he would prefer to press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, let's be honest, the reason that the Obama campaign wants to do this is because they want to talk about anything but President Obama's dismal record when it comes to the economy,&quot; Ed Gillespie, a senior Romney adviser, said on CNN's State of the Union dominated by the issue. &quot;And it's working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been a distraction,&quot; veteran GOP strategist Mary Matalin said on ABC's This Week, though she argued that voters care more about their own financial situations than that of the likely Republican  nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney team dispatched Gillespie, New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte and spokesman Kevin Madden to TV studios Sunday. Their talking points: that Romney left Bain Capital when he took over the troubled  1999 Olympics in Salt Lake City  and effectively never returned, even though SEC filings continued to list him as president, CEO and sole stockholder of the private-equity firm. The demands of the Olympics prompted him to &quot;retire retroactively,&quot; Gillespie said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama team fielded Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, strategist David Axelrod and spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter with their talking points: that Romney either misled the SEC about his role when he signed the documents then (that would be a felony, Cutter noted in a conference call with reporters Thursday) or is misleading the American people now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has made Bain Capital his calling card for the presidency, and when you look at it, it doesn't measure up to what he claims,&quot; Emanuel said. His advice to Romney: &quot;Stop whining.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subject might seem secondary in a contest with candidates who espouse sharply different philosophies about the role of government and conflicting visions about how best to boost the economy. But both campaigns take it seriously in an election that has less than four months to go and in a race that has been closely divided and relatively stable. Obama now holds a narrow lead over Romney, 47%-45%, according to Gallup's rolling seven-day survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats are trying to broaden the Bain issue to raise questions about Romney's integrity and  commitment to  U.S. workers. They have tied it to their demands that he release more than the two years of tax returns he has promised and they are hammering him for having a Swiss bank account and investing in the Cayman Islands. &quot;His tax filing looks more like an Olympic village than it does a middle-class family,&quot; Emanuel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans counter by saying the attacks raise questions about Obama's character. In a one-day blitz of national TV interviews Friday, Romney said the attacks by the Obama campaign were &quot;beneath the dignity of the presidency&quot; and demanded an apology. (Obama has declined to oblige.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On CBS Sunday Morning, the president acknowledged that his rival will base his campaign on his administration's failure to make the economy better than it is today. &quot;You don't hear me complaining about him making that argument,&quot; Obama says, &quot;because if I was in his shoes, I'd be making the same argument.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides have unveiled broadcast ads as personal and cutting as any that have aired to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When a president doesn't tell the truth, how can we trust him to lead?&quot; the Romney&nbsp;ad opens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney's not the solution,&quot; an Obama&nbsp;ad concludes. It shows Romney singing America, the Beautiful as headlines are shown about his Swiss bank account and overseas investments. &quot;He's the problem.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's getting down and dirty in election land. Last week, President Obama's campaign suggested Mitt Romney might be guilty of a felony for filing misleading papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission (a charge The Post's &quot;Fact Checker&quot; column discounted); and Romney's team aired a new ad portraying Obama as a liar. The candidates are orchestrating rival campaigns of character assassination. Obama casts Romney as a wealthy, greedy, coldhearted investor who put profits over people and who &quot;outsourced&quot; jobs. Romney's&nbsp;Obama is a power-hungry interventionist, whose meddling policies alienate business, slow the recovery and threaten Americans' freedom.There are more charitable and revealing ways, I think, of contrasting the candidates than these partisan caricatures. I would call Obama a &quot;distributionalist&quot; and Romney an &quot;expansionist.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By &quot;distributionalist,&quot; I mean that Obama sees government as an instrument to promote economic and social justice by redistributing the bounty of a wealthy society. Economic growth is not ignored but tends to be taken for granted or treated as a less important priority. How else, for example, to explain Obama's decision to push the Affordable Care Act (the ACA or &quot;Obamacare&quot;) - a huge new social program - in the midst of the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Obama, government is the means to protect the weak and police the strong. It makes the system more responsible by regulating undesirable behavior (say, pollution or false advertising) and encouraging socially useful sectors (say, &quot;green&quot; energy). Government becomes the ultimate economic arbiter and an agent of the broad middle class against the narrow interests of the rich or corporations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an &quot;expansionist,&quot; Romney sees higher economic growth as the solution to many of our pressing problems. It reduces poverty, raises Americans' sense of self-worth and soothes social conflicts. Overactive government weakens the economy by creating uncertainties and obstacles to investment and risk-taking. The emphasis on redistributing economic gain for the greater good sounds enlightened but becomes self-defeating by lowering economic growth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is it just the rich against the rest, in Romney's view. The losers in a slow-growing economy include the unemployed - especially the young - along with stressed state and local governments, and families whose savings have been depleted. Big budget deficits, one consequence of slow growth, squeeze many government programs. Only by lowering tax rates and reducing regulation can we revive economic growth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let it be said that, in practice, these views are not mutually exclusive. Of course, Democrats prefer higher economic growth; Republicans won't eliminate all taxes or regulations. Campaign rhetoric exaggerates differences. Still, the contrasts are genuine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What they have in common, I think, is nostalgia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama practices a cheap populism. He seems to presume that the complexities of the ACA and his repeated attacks on business (on oil companies, insurance companies, banks, hedge funds, private-equity funds and &quot;the rich&quot; in general) have no effect on the climate for investment or job creation. This is dubious. His distributionalism has consequences. True, Obama inherited a dismal economy and massive job loss; but the fact that the recovery has weakened while unemployment remains high cannot be divorced from the mistrust he's engendered in the business community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Romney, his emphasis on higher economic growth, though desirable, is no panacea. Even were he to succeed, growth rates almost certainly won't regain previous levels for a simple reason: an aging society. There will be more retirees, fewer new workers. Romney can't change that. And even faster economic growth will leave massive budget deficits, which reflect a vast gap - also driven by aging and high health costs - between future spending commitments and taxes. Tax rates can be cut, but any revenue loss would need to be offset by ending tax breaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media campaigns that Obama and Romney are waging against each other are politically unsurprising. Victory awaits the side that can convince the most uncommitted voters that the other guy is a louse. The nostalgic lapse of Democrats into social protectors and Republicans into tax cutters is equally understandable. The roles are familiar and satisfying. The trouble is that they've been overtaken by reality. Yesterday's stereotypes won't solve today's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A central issue for November's winner will be to bridge the gap between government's spending commitments and its tax resources - without so jolting the economy that its feeble performance deteriorates further or, alternatively, so shocking public opinion that it creates a backlash and collapses. This is the real but ignored challenge: to redefine government in a way that is economically viable and politically acceptable. To the extent that the presidential campaign might clarify choices or encourage a consensus, it is (so far) being squandered. Character assassination is a diversion, not a policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trying to shift the presidential campaign narrative away from his personal finances and tenure at Bain Capital, Republican Mitt Romney will launch a fresh assault this week accusing President Obama of political cronyism at the expense of middle-class workers.          In a coordinated offensive starting Monday, the Romney team and its allies will say that the president has been a &quot;typical politician&quot; and has demonstrated &quot;systematic favoritism&quot; toward top campaign fundraisers by lavishing them with federal appointments and their companies with taxpayer money and special government deals, according to campaign officials.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All year on the stump, Romney has broadly labeled Obama a &quot;crony capitalist,&quot; but aides said the presumptive GOP nominee will deliver the attack to voters in a sharper and more substantive and sustained manner beginning at a Tuesday rally in Pennsylvania.The overall effort, under the branding &quot;Obama's Political Payoffs and Middle Class Layoffs,&quot; will highlight alleged administration favoritism toward more than 200 Obama donors. The campaign will push the theme through online videos, appearances by Romney surrogates and messages tailored to battleground states, as well as Spanish-language and other specialty media. Campaign officials said they are considering television advertisements as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're a political donor to Barack Obama, you're going to do fine, because you're going to get a payoff. If you're a middle-class worker, you're in jeopardy, you're facing a layoff,&quot; Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to Romney, said on CNN's &quot;State of the Union.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             Obama campaign officials see this as a weak line of attack, in part because, they said, _blankRomney played favorites by steering tax breaks to some companies over others as governor of Massachusetts.          &quot;It's clear that Mitt Romney will do anything to avoid answering serious questions about his tenure as a corporate buyout specialist,&quot; Obama spokeswoman Lis Smith said. &quot;But launching false attacks that only boomerang on his record of cronyism in Massachusetts and the Olympics won't do it.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With some prominent Republicans urging Romney to fight back harder against stinging attacks from Obama over his Bain career, the new cronyism offensive is designed to put Romney and his campaign back on the offensive and to force Obama to fight on the politically difficult terrain of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're turning the page,&quot; one adviser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear how easily Romney will be able to regain his footing in a race that has become consumed by questions surrounding his career at Bain, the private-equity firm he founded and ran, and his unwillingness to share more personal financial information.                    In a rare move to defend himself, Romney granted interviews to all five major television news networks Friday night, but he did not put the issue to rest. He has not fully clarified the confusion surrounding his tenure at Bain - specifically the scope of his involvement between 1999 and 2002, when he was running the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City but remained listed as Bain's chief executive.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             Gillespie said Sunday that Romney &quot;retired retroactively&quot; but was not responsible for Bain's day-to-day decisions while overseeing the Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He took a leave of absence from Bain and left a life that he loved to help a country that he loves more, to save the Olympics,&quot; Gillespie said on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for the Obama campaign, that is an unsatisfactory explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Either you're the CEO, president, chairman of the board of Bain Capital, as you attest to the SEC, or he's telling the American people he bears no responsibility for that. Both those things can't be true,&quot; Stephanie Cutter, the president's deputy campaign manager, said on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Romney is being scolded for not disclosing more than two years of tax returns. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R) _blankcalled on him to &quot;release everything to the American people,&quot; a sentiment echoed on the Sunday political talk shows by former George W. Bush strategist Matthew Dowd and conservative commentators George F. Will and William Kristol.          This comes as Romney struggles to beat back weeks of attacks from Obama, which some Republicans are fretting could stick with voters, referencing the damage caused by the Republican-led &quot;Swift boat&quot; attacks on the military record of Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), the Democratic nominee in 2004.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's advisers insist that Obama's television ads about Bain have not damaged the Republican; most public polling suggests the race remains a dead heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stuart Stevens, Romney's chief strategist, said Obama's latest ad - which pairs Romney's singing of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; with references to news reports linking him to the outsourcing of jobs and to a Swiss bank account - is evidence of the Obama campaign &quot;melting down.&quot;          &quot;It's like you're in an argument and you're not winning, so you just start screaming,&quot; Stevens said in an interview. &quot;This is the Barack Obama who mocks people who cling to their guns and religion and sing patriotic songs like 'America the Beautiful,' who condescends to the middle class by calling them 'Uncle Jims.'[#x200a]&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the Romney campaign has felt compelled to respond with paid advertising, including _blanka spot released Sunday that accuses Obama of running a negative campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's new offensive Monday will focus on some companies that have long been the subject of public debate - such as green energy firm Solyndra and electric-car maker Fisker Automotive - but will introduce research about other companies whose connections to the administration have not been under as bright a spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include the Westly Group, a venture capital firm whose portfolio companies reportedly have received more than half a billion dollars in economic stimulus money, loans and grants from the Energy Department. Founder Steve Westly is one of Obama's biggest bundlers in California and sits on an advisory committee to Energy Secretary Steven Chu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other examples include First Wind, an energy firm that hired an Obama bundler and former senior aide to Vice President Biden as its lobbyist and later secured $452 million in stimulus grants for its wind farms; and _blankBrightSource Energy, which, after hiring a second former top Biden aide as its lobbyist, won a $1.6 billion federal loan guarantee to complete construction of three solar energy plants.ruckerp@washpost.com</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What they have in common, I think, is nostalgia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama practices a cheap populism. He seems to presume that the complexities of the ACA and his repeated attacks on business (on oil companies, insurance companies, banks, hedge funds, private-equity funds and &quot;the rich&quot; in general) have no effect on the climate for investment or job creation. This is dubious. His distributionalism has consequences. True, Obama inherited a dismal economy and massive job loss; but the fact that the recovery has weakened while unemployment remains high cannot be divorced from the mistrust he's engendered in the business community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Romney, his emphasis on higher economic growth, though desirable, is no panacea. Even were he to succeed, growth rates almost certainly won't regain previous levels for a simple reason: an aging society. There will be more retirees, fewer new workers. Romney can't change that. And even faster economic growth will leave massive budget deficits, which reflect a vast gap - also driven by aging and high health costs - between future spending commitments and taxes. Tax rates can be cut, but any revenue loss would need to be offset by ending tax breaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media campaigns that Obama and Romney are waging against each other are politically unsurprising. Victory awaits the side that can convince the most uncommitted voters that the other guy is a louse. The nostalgic lapse of Democrats into social protectors and Republicans into tax cutters is equally understandable. The roles are familiar and satisfying. The trouble is that they've been overtaken by reality. Yesterday's stereotypes won't solve today's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A central issue for November's winner will be to bridge the gap between government's spending commitments and its tax resources - without so jolting the economy that its feeble performance deteriorates further or, alternatively, so shocking public opinion that it creates a backlash and collapses. This is the real but ignored challenge: to redefine government in a way that is economically viable and politically acceptable. To the extent that the presidential campaign might clarify choices or encourage a consensus, it is (so far) being squandered. Character assassination is a diversion, not a policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trying to shift the presidential campaign narrative away from his personal finances and tenure at Bain Capital, Republican Mitt Romney will launch a fresh assault this week accusing President Obama of political cronyism at the expense of middle-class workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a coordinated offensive starting Monday, the Romney team and its allies will say that the president has been a &quot;typical politician&quot; and has demonstrated &quot;systematic favoritism&quot; toward top campaign fundraisers by lavishing them with federal appointments and their companies with taxpayer money and special government deals, according to campaign officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All year on the stump, Romney has broadly labeled Obama a &quot;crony capitalist,&quot; but aides said the presumptive GOP nominee will deliver the attack to voters in a sharper and more substantive and sustained manner beginning at a Tuesday rally in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overall effort, under the branding &quot;Obama's Political Payoffs and Middle Class Layoffs,&quot; will highlight alleged administration favoritism toward more than 200 Obama donors. The campaign will push the theme through online videos, appearances by Romney surrogates and messages tailored to battleground states, as well as Spanish-language and other specialty media. Campaign officials said they are considering television advertisements as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're a political donor to Barack Obama, you're going to do fine, because you're going to get a payoff. If you're a middle-class worker, you're in jeopardy, you're facing a layoff,&quot; Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to Romney, said on CNN's &quot;State of the Union.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign officials see this as a weak line of attack, in part because, they said, _blankRomney played favorites by steering tax breaks to some companies over others as governor of Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's clear that Mitt Romney will do anything to avoid answering serious questions about his tenure as a corporate buyout specialist,&quot; Obama spokeswoman Lis Smith said. &quot;But launching false attacks that only boomerang on his record of cronyism in Massachusetts and the Olympics won't do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With some prominent Republicans urging Romney to fight back harder against stinging attacks from Obama over his Bain career, the new cronyism offensive is designed to put Romney and his campaign back on the offensive and to force Obama to fight on the politically difficult terrain of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're turning the page,&quot; one adviser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear how easily Romney will be able to regain his footing in a race that has become consumed by questions surrounding his career at Bain, the private-equity firm he founded and ran, and his unwillingness to share more personal financial information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a rare move to defend himself, Romney granted interviews to all five major television news networks Friday night, but he did not put the issue to rest. He has not fully clarified the confusion surrounding his tenure at Bain - specifically the scope of his involvement between 1999 and 2002, when he was running the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City but remained listed as Bain's chief executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gillespie said Sunday that Romney &quot;retired retroactively&quot; but was not responsible for Bain's day-to-day decisions while overseeing the Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He took a leave of absence from Bain and left a life that he loved to help a country that he loves more, to save the Olympics,&quot; Gillespie said on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for the Obama campaign, that is an unsatisfactory explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Either you're the CEO, president, chairman of the board of Bain Capital, as you attest to the SEC, or he's telling the American people he bears no responsibility for that. Both those things can't be true,&quot; Stephanie Cutter, the president's deputy campaign manager, said on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Romney is being scolded for not disclosing more than two years of tax returns. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R) _blankcalled on him to &quot;release everything to the American people,&quot; a sentiment echoed on the Sunday political talk shows by former George W. Bush strategist Matthew Dowd and conservative commentators George F. Will and William Kristol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This comes as Romney struggles to beat back weeks of attacks from Obama, which some Republicans are fretting could stick with voters, referencing the damage caused by the Republican-led &quot;Swift boat&quot; attacks on the military record of Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), the Democratic nominee in 2004. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's advisers insist that Obama's television ads about Bain have not damaged the Republican; most public polling suggests the race remains a dead heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stuart Stevens, Romney's chief strategist, said Obama's latest ad - which pairs Romney's singing of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; with references to news reports linking him to the outsourcing of jobs and to a Swiss bank account - is evidence of the Obama campaign &quot;melting down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like you're in an argument and you're not winning, so you just start screaming,&quot; Stevens said in an interview. &quot;This is the Barack Obama who mocks people who cling to their guns and religion and sing patriotic songs like 'America the Beautiful,' who condescends to the middle class by calling them 'Uncle Jims.'&acirc;[#x20ac][#x160]&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the Romney campaign has felt compelled to respond with paid advertising, including _blanka spot released Sunday that accuses Obama of running a negative campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's new offensive Monday will focus on some companies that have long been the subject of public debate - such as green energy firm Solyndra and electric-car maker Fisker Automotive - but will introduce research about other companies whose connections to the administration have not been under as bright a spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include the Westly Group, a venture capital firm whose portfolio companies reportedly have received more than half a billion dollars in economic stimulus money, loans and grants from the Energy Department. Founder Steve Westly is one of Obama's biggest bundlers in California and sits on an advisory committee to Energy Secretary Steven Chu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other examples include First Wind, an energy firm that hired an Obama bundler and former senior aide to Vice President Biden as its lobbyist and later secured $452 million in stimulus grants for its wind farms; and _blankBrightSource Energy, which, after hiring a second former top Biden aide as its lobbyist, won a $1.6 billion federal loan guarantee to complete construction of three solar energy plants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLIFTON, Va. -- President Obama barnstormed through this swing state on Saturday as his campaign relentlessly hammered at Mitt Romney's business record, releasing a mocking new ad that shows Mr. Romney singing ''America the Beautiful'' as it accuses his former firm of shipping American jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, speaking first to a drenched crowd during a downpour in the Richmond suburb of Glen Allen, and then at Centreville High School in Fairfax County, accused Mr. Romney of investing in ''companies that have been called pioneers in outsourcing.'' He ignored Mr. Romney's demands for an apology about the campaign's tone, which the Republican candidate had called for in interviews on Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''My opponent and his allies in Congress, they believe in top-down economics,'' Mr. Obama said. ''If you cut through all the stuff, what they are really saying is tax cuts for the wealthy, roll back regulations. That is essentially their plan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's campaign has spent more than a week harping on Mr. Romney's personal wealth and calling on him to disclose information about his personal finances by releasing more years of his tax returns. It has also raised questions about Mr. Romney's offshore investments and accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ad reminds viewers of those issues as it shows a clip of Mr. Romney singing at a campaign event in Florida this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says Mr. Romney shipped jobs to Mexico, China and India -- accusations that Mr. Romney's campaign vehemently denies. And it says Mr. Romney had ''millions'' in a Swiss bank account and ''tax havens'' in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mitt Romney's not the solution,'' the ad states. ''He's the problem.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, the Republican campaign repeated Mr. Romney's angry comments about what it said are untrue allegations surrounding Mr. Romney's personal finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''As the failures of his presidency become more evident, Barack Obama has resorted to the tactics of a typical politician: dishonest and totally unsubstantiated attacks meant to distract from his own record by smearing the reputation of his opponent,'' said Amanda Hennenberg, a Romney campaign spokeswoman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign has repeatedly defended the offshore accounts, saying that he paid all the taxes legally required. On Friday, Mr. Romney again refused to release multiple years of his tax returns. He has released a return for 2010, and an estimate for 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He characterized the Obama campaign's allegations as ''reckless'' and ''absurd.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Mr. Romney's campaign hoped that his rival's campaign would back off its aggressive tone, they were disappointed. Traveling with the president on Air Force One, Mr. Obama's top aides went out of their way Saturday morning to highlight their continued attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the television ad, Mr. Obama's campaign released a Web video compilation of attacks that Mr. Romney has made in the past. The point, aides said, is that Mr. Romney is equally responsible for the campaign's tone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mitt Romney, I just want to remind you, is the same candidate who questioned whether the president understood America, questioned whether he understood freedom,'' said Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign. ''He spends a lot of time attacking.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video, titled ''Asking for Apologies While Launching Attacks,'' shows Mr. Romney raising the issue of Mr. Obama's ties to the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. and shows him accusing the president of ''appeasement'' in his foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This president spends a lot of time apologizing for America,'' the video shows Mr. Romney saying. ''He should be apologizing to America.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video concludes by saying: ''Mitt Romney. He sure asks for a lot of apologies. When he's not busy launching attacks.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout most of his speech on Saturday, his second day in Virginia, Mr. Obama avoided the down-and-dirty political combat that has consumed much of the campaign coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Even though the crisis put us through some very tough times, the American people are tougher,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Folks may have gotten knocked down some, but they got back up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the second half of Mr. Obama's stump speech is tougher. He accused Republicans of giving tax breaks to companies that send work overseas. And he quoted Mr. Romney as ''saying let Detroit go bankrupt,'' the headline on an article he wrote in The New York Times arguing for a managed bankruptcy for the auto industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concluded with a fiery defense of his health care bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Supreme Court has spoken. It is the law of the land. We are going to implement it,'' he said. ''It was the right thing to do. We're not going backwards, we are going forward.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans and Mitt Romney have relentlessly accused President Obama of not moving swiftly enough to tap the nations' considerable offshore reserves of oil and natural gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a tired complaint. Except for a necessary drilling ban in the Gulf of Mexico after the BP oil spill in 2010, Mr. Obama has always embraced offshore oil and gas exploration as an important component of a rounded energy strategy. What he has not embraced is the drill-now-drill-everywhere approach of President George W. Bush, now embodied in a House bill that would open the entire continental shelf and all of Alaska's waters to drilling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration's latest drilling plan, which covers the years 2012 to 2017, would allow 12 large lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and three smaller, carefully selected lease sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas and the Cook Inlet in Alaska. There would be preliminary seismic testing, but no leasing, in the Atlantic. The approach is broadly similar to the leasing program announced in March 2010 and put on hold after the BP spill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans, however, are in a lather. Representative Doc Hastings, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, called the Obama plan ''a giant step backward for American offshore energy production.'' Mr. Hastings has unveiled a bill that would allow drilling rigs on the coasts of Maine, California, Oregon and Washington, and in Alaska's Bristol Bay, a rich commercial fishery that even President George H. W. Bush chose to protect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration says its plan will give the industry access to three-quarters of America's recoverable offshore oil and gas resources. This is theoretically true but highly unlikely in practice if the administration honors its pledge to protect sensitive waters, wildlife and native fishing grounds in Alaska. Mr. Hastings's plan assumes that places like Maine and California will welcome drilling, which they have strongly opposed in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deeper Republican fraud is the idea that a country with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves -- and a daily appetite for more than one-fifth of the world's oil production -- can drill its way to energy independence. Mr. Obama correctly sees drilling as one element in a multipronged approach that also includes investments in energy efficiency, cleaner cars and alternative fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conservatives' assertion that drilling alone is sufficient is not only environmentally irresponsible but the stuff of fantasy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign is out with a new ad that takes President Obama to task for his campaign's attacks against Mitt Romney, suggesting that they contrast sharply with the &quot;hope and change&quot; theme of Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad's release comes as the Obama campaign continues a barrage of attacks against Mr. Romney over his tenure at Bain Capital and his financial accounts held outside the United States, critiques that led Mr. Romney to demand an apology from Mr. Obama on Friday.</SPAN></P>

Scott Walker, who survived a tough recall election last month and has become a hero to many of his fellow Republicans, has some advice for Mitt Romney: Get on offense and stay on offense. &quot;Never fight a battle on your heels,&quot; he says.          As Walker offered this advice Friday, Romney was trying to get off his heels. In a round of television interviews, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee lashed back at President Obama's campaign for suggesting that he may have committed a felony by not being entirely truthful about when he relinquished control at Bain Capital.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's finances and tenure at Bain dominated the campaign week, despite the fact that it came immediately after the third tepid jobs report in three months that should have put the president on the defensive. Instead, the Obama team kept the pressure on Romney, taunting him to release more years of tax returns and hectoring him over the private equity company he founded. The week ended with the president and Romney hurling questions and accusations at each other.Republicans are nervous about what some see as the Romney campaign's relative passivity in the face of the onslaught by the Obama team. The president's forces have spent almost $25 million on ads this spring and summer, attacking Romney over his role at Bain and the outsourcing that was done by some of the companies in which Bain had invested. Overall, they have vastly outspent Romney on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney is at a financial disadvantage right now, despite the fact that he's raising money faster than the president. By the rules of the game, Obama is spending money raised for the primaries. For Romney, that primary season account is significantly depleted, because of the length of the GOP nomination battle. Campaign advisers say much of the money he is raising now is for the general election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't do much to tamp down worries among Republicans that Obama will effectively disqualify Romney in the eyes of many voters before the two national conventions. Romney advisers point to polls that show there has been little movement in the overall race, despite the pounding from the Obama campaign, as evidence that the president is not making headway with his attacks. But Romney's decision to fire back on Friday, as well as a sharply negative ad unveiled that morning, suggest that he and his team have reached the same conclusion as the Wisconsin governor - that it's time to get on offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker isn't convinced that the Bain-related attacks will take root. But to the extent that they fill a vacuum created by Romney's failure either to fight back or more aggressively talk about economic and fiscal issues, the governor sees reason to worry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president's team desperately does not want to run on his record, so they are desperately trying to have it about anything other than his record,&quot; Walker said by telephone from Williamsburg, where he is attending the National Governors Association meeting. He added of Romney: &quot;He's got to be forceful about fighting back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker believes that where Romney needs to show more aggression is in the larger debate about the economy and the country's debt and deficit problems. &quot;I think he's been very good in articulating the economy message,&quot; Walker said. &quot;I've heard bits and pieces but haven't seen it collectively put together as a strong argument on the budget side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's advisers hope to make the November election a referendum on the president, and there's little doubt that Obama's record will be the biggest factor in the minds of most voters. But Walker pointed to 1980, when Ronald Reagan defeated then-President Jimmy Carter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reagan is remembered for the famous question, &quot;Are you better off than you were four years ago?&quot; That question helped sink Carter. But as Walker notes, there was more to the Reagan campaign than one crystallizing question in the final weeks before the election. Reagan had campaigned constantly on themes of limited government and restoring American power and prestige. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We knew what Ronald Reagan stood for,&quot; Walker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker urged Romney to develop a more robust message about how he would tackle the issues of debt and deficit, as he said many Republican governors have done in the past few years. When the two appeared together in Janesville, Wis., recently, Walker said he was impressed with Romney's economic message but added: &quot;I think he needs to do more on the fiscal side. . . . He's got to repeat it over and over and over, particularly on visits to swing states. He's got to talk about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker went through his own budget wars in early 2011. His aggressive attack on public-employee unions tore his state apart and led to the recall election. He came out of the experienced chastened by the mistakes he made in not preparing the public better for what he planned to do. &quot;I was so eager to fix things; I didn't talk about it,&quot; he said, repeating the lesson he told voters he had learned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Walker also believes that what ultimately saved him in the recall vote was his willingness to take controversial positions on how to deal with the state's budget problems. He believes voters reward politicians who take strong stands. He says the more Romney is willing to articulate that kind of fiscal agenda for the country, the better his chances of winning in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is that an argument for putting a fellow Wisconsin Republican, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, on the ticket? &quot;Absolutely,&quot; he said. &quot;The reason Paul's legitimately on the short list [of vice presidential contenders] is that it shows Governor Romney is serious about tackling the issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats would love to run against Ryan's budget blueprint, believing it would turn off swing voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Picking Ryan would show just how serious Romney is about embracing a bold fiscal agenda. But the choice of a vice president is less important than the presumptive nominee's message and posture. As Walker put it: &quot;Always be aggressive, moving forward. You're always better moving forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama won Wisconsin easily four years ago. After prevailing in the recall election, Walker said he told Romney the state is now in play in November. But he offered this other piece of advice: It's not enough for Romney to present himself as a Republican alternative. &quot;Those independent voters who swung over to me have to see the &quot;R&quot; standing for 'reform,' &quot; he said. &quot;That's the thing swing voters are looking for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans will be looking in the coming weeks to see how Romney responds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             ROANOKE -              President Obama barnstormed five cities across Virginia this weekend, stepping up his attacks on Republican Mitt Romney as the two candidates demonstrated the hard fight ahead in a state crucial to the battle for the White House.                       Romney sent an army of surrogates into Virginia to counter the president's fast-paced, two-day swing. The Republican's campaign bus circled Obama's events, former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani made an appearance, and scores of local Republicans lined the road with banners and posters to protest Obama's appearance at a Northern Virginia high school Saturday.            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus on Virginia's cities, suburbs, mountains and military bases captures dramatically how varied and unpredictable the state is despite the president's historic victory here in 2008. Both candidates see great opportunity in the political geography of the Old Dominion, and neither is certain of winning it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me just say this,&quot; Obama told a crowd of more than 3,000 packed into a four-block stretch of downtown Roanoke late Friday. &quot;If I win Virginia, I'm going to get four more years. That I can say with some confidence.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama continued his blitz on Romney's record at Bain Capital even after the Republican demanded an apology for the president's sharp attacks. Instead of offering one, Obama debuted _blanka tough new ad in nine states, including Virginia, accusing Bain of moving jobs overseas and even mocking Romney's rendition of &quot;America the Beautiful.&quot; At one appearance, the president declared: &quot;I believe in insourcing.&quot;          Virginia's evolution into electoral battleground is a story best told with a map. The commonwealth was once deeply conservative, and Republicans still dominate the southern and western rural swaths. But growing minority populations in the eastern cities and inner suburbs, younger and independent-minded military families in Hampton Roads, and moderate newcomers to the booming exurbs of Washington and Richmond have transformed Virginia into one of the most important presidential battlegrounds of the year.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) noted that in 2009 he won virtually all the Virginia battlegrounds that pushed Obama to victory the year before. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the kitchen-table voters,&quot; McDonnell said. &quot;Thirty percent of voters in Virginia, maybe even more in the suburbs and exurbs, are people who really don't vote party. They vote the person, and they vote the issue. And from what I'm hearing from people, and from what the polls indicate are important to people, the president's got a horrible record and Mitt Romney's got better ideas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          All over the map          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's itinerary Friday and Saturday reflected Virginia's changing political map. A few miles from Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach, he met with Navy families over lunch. He drew large minority crowds in Hampton, an urban enclave in Tidewater. He stopped in Roanoke - he is the first sitting president in decades to do so - trying to expand the valuable concentrations of Democrats in western Virginia's string of small cities. And he hit the vote-rich outskirts of Richmond and Washington, ground zero for Virginia's political evolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of those groups remain up for grabs, and some are out of reach. The independent voters Obama is courting among suburbanites, service members, business leaders and federal workers are on Romney's radar, too. McDonnell noted that two of Obama's five stops this weekend - in Virginia Beach and Glen Allen - were in Republican neighborhoods where McDonnell has lived. (Glen Allen, where Obama spoke in a drenching thunderstorm, is also in House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's district). And deeply conservative rural Virginia serves as a constant reminder for Obama that, despite the opportunities, his path to victory here is narrow.          &quot;We have a very legitimate opportunity to win races that we weren't winning before,&quot; said U.S. Senate candidate and former governor Timothy M. Kaine. &quot;But it's nothing to be cocky or complacent about.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was fitting that Obama traveled the state Friday with the two Democrats, Kaine and U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner, who redrew Virginia's political map over the past decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warner, a business-friendly cellphone millionaire, used his moderate, pro-business record to persuade a vast sea of independents across Virginia, even in the rural swaths, to vote Democratic after years when that was out of the question for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Kaine, a former Richmond mayor and civil rights lawyer who had been expected to struggle with those same independents in his 2005 gubernatorial bid, targeted - and won - a whole other category of receptive voters: moderate suburban newcomers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One coveted group of Virginia voters targeted heavily by both sides this weekend are military families. On Friday, Obama made an unscheduled stop at Rick's Cafe in Virginia Beach to meet with military spouses and promote his increases in funds for veterans services, programs to support military families and efforts to encourage employers to hire returning service members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prior to this administration, you never heard about military families,&quot; Jennifer Farlin, a mother of two young boys and wife of a Navy commander serving overseas, told the president. &quot;It makes me feel very supported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also chose Ricki Thompson to introduce him at his main event in Virginia Beach. She is a Navy veteran, a Navy spouse and a mom - a trifecta of appealing attributes for the voters the president is courting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day ahead of Obama's Virginia swing, Romney reached out to military families, too, launching an aggressive effort to blame the president for deep cuts due to hit the Pentagon next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What was designed to be a political hammer over both parties is now getting close to reality and is causing a disaster of uncertainty for the Defense Department and job creators in the defense industry all over the country,&quot; McDonnell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the White House and Obama's Chicago-based campaign pushed back against the accusation by explaining that the cuts were made intentionally onerous by both parties to encourage them to come to broader agreement on how to reduce the national debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Virginia demographics          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electoral results and recent polling by The Washington Post show how demographically varied Virginia is. The inner suburbs of Washington, for instance, feature far more registered Democrats proportionally than the state overall. Rural Virginia is so much more conservative than the more populous east that, in 2008, Obama ran 12 points behind his overall performance in Virginia. And in Tidewater, where Obama made two stops Friday, black voters constitute 38 percent of voters, twice the percentage of the entire state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's enormous popularity among black voters was on full display throughout the weekend swing. Motorcading through minority-heavy neighborhoods in Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Hampton, Obama traveled boulevards lined with supporters who jumped, cheered and waved signs as he passed. One woman came out of a beauty parlor, her hair still in curlers, during his brief stop at Rick's Cafe. A teenage girl fainted during his speech at Green Run High School. And at Phoebus High School in Hampton, he couldn't finish a sentence without being interrupted by exuberant cheers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We got your back, Obama!&quot; one woman screamed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans will be looking in the coming weeks to see how Romney responds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROANOKE -President Obama barnstormed five cities across Virginia this weekend, stepping up his attacks on Republican Mitt Romney as the two candidates demonstrated the hard fight ahead in a state crucial to the battle for the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney sent an army of surrogates into Virginia to counter the president's fast-paced, two-day swing. The Republican's campaign bus circled Obama's events, former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani made an appearance, and scores of local Republicans lined the road with banners and posters to protest Obama's appearance at a Northern Virginia high school Saturday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus on Virginia's cities, suburbs, mountains and military bases captures dramatically how varied and unpredictable the state is despite the president's historic victory here in 2008. Both candidates see great opportunity in the political geography of the Old Dominion, and neither is certain of winning it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me just say this,&quot; Obama told a crowd of more than 3,000 packed into a four-block stretch of downtown Roanoke late Friday. &quot;If I win Virginia, I'm going to get four more years. That I can say with some confidence.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama continued his blitz on Romney's record at Bain Capital even after the Republican demanded an apology for the president's sharp attacks. Instead of offering one, Obama debuted _blanka tough new ad in nine states, including Virginia, accusing Bain of moving jobs overseas and even mocking Romney's rendition of &quot;America the Beautiful.&quot; At one appearance, the president declared: &quot;I believe in insourcing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia's evolution into electoral battleground is a story best told with a map. The commonwealth was once deeply conservative, and Republicans still dominate the southern and western rural swaths. But growing minority populations in the eastern cities and inner suburbs, younger and independent-minded military families in Hampton Roads, and moderate newcomers to the booming exurbs of Washington and Richmond have transformed Virginia into one of the most important presidential battlegrounds of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) noted that in 2009 he won virtually all the Virginia battlegrounds that pushed Obama to victory the year before. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the kitchen-table voters,&quot; McDonnell said. &quot;Thirty percent of voters in Virginia, maybe even more in the suburbs and exurbs, are people who really don't vote party. They vote the person, and they vote the issue. And from what I'm hearing from people, and from what the polls indicate are important to people, the president's got a horrible record and Mitt Romney's got better ideas.&quot;<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">All over the map</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's itinerary Friday and Saturday reflected Virginia's changing political map. A few miles from Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach, he met with Navy families over lunch. He drew large minority crowds in Hampton, an urban enclave in Tidewater. He stopped in Roanoke - he is the first sitting president in decades to do so - trying to expand the valuable concentrations of Democrats in western Virginia's string of small cities. And he hit the vote-rich outskirts of Richmond and Washington, ground zero for Virginia's political evolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of those groups remain up for grabs, and some are out of reach. The independent voters Obama is courting among suburbanites, service members, business leaders and federal workers are on Romney's radar, too. McDonnell noted that two of Obama's five stops this weekend - in Virginia Beach and Glen Allen - were in Republican neighborhoods where McDonnell has lived. (Glen Allen, where Obama spoke in a drenching thunderstorm, is also in House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's district). And deeply conservative rural Virginia serves as a constant reminder for Obama that, despite the opportunities, his path to victory here is narrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a very legitimate opportunity to win races that we weren't winning before,&quot; said U.S. Senate candidate and former governor Timothy M. Kaine. &quot;But it's nothing to be cocky or complacent about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was fitting that Obama traveled the state Friday with the two Democrats, Kaine and U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner, who redrew Virginia's political map over the past decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warner, a business-friendly cellphone millionaire, used his moderate, pro-business record to persuade a vast sea of independents across Virginia, even in the rural swaths, to vote Democratic after years when that was out of the question for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Kaine, a former Richmond mayor and civil rights lawyer who had been expected to struggle with those same independents in his 2005 gubernatorial bid, targeted - and won - a whole other category of receptive voters: moderate suburban newcomers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One coveted group of Virginia voters targeted heavily by both sides this weekend are military families. On Friday, Obama made an unscheduled stop at Rick's Cafe in Virginia Beach to meet with military spouses and promote his increases in funds for veterans services, programs to support military families and efforts to encourage employers to hire returning service members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prior to this administration, you never heard about military families,&quot; Jennifer Farlin, a mother of two young boys and wife of a Navy commander serving overseas, told the president. &quot;It makes me feel very supported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also chose Ricki Thompson to introduce him at his main event in Virginia Beach. She is a Navy veteran, a Navy spouse and a mom - a trifecta of appealing attributes for the voters the president is courting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day ahead of Obama's Virginia swing, Romney reached out to military families, too, launching an aggressive effort to blame the president for deep cuts due to hit the Pentagon next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What was designed to be a political hammer over both parties is now getting close to reality and is causing a disaster of uncertainty for the Defense Department and job creators in the defense industry all over the country,&quot; McDonnell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the White House and Obama's Chicago-based campaign pushed back against the accusation by explaining that the cuts were made intentionally onerous by both parties to encourage them to come to broader agreement on how to reduce the national debt.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Virginia demographics</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electoral results and recent polling by The Washington Post show how demographically varied Virginia is. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inner suburbs of Washington, for instance, feature far more registered Democrats proportionally than the state overall. Rural Virginia is so much more conservative than the more populous east that, in 2008, Obama ran 12 points behind his overall performance in Virginia. And in Tidewater, where Obama made two stops Friday, black voters constitute 38 percent of voters, twice the percentage of the entire state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's enormous popularity among black voters was on full display throughout the weekend swing. Motorcading through minority-heavy neighborhoods in Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Hampton, Obama traveled boulevards lined with supporters who jumped, cheered and waved signs as he passed. One woman came out of a beauty parlor, her hair still in curlers, during his brief stop at Rick's Cafe. A teenage girl fainted during his speech at Green Run High School. And at Phoebus High School in Hampton, he couldn't finish a sentence without being interrupted by exuberant cheers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We got your back, Obama!&quot; one woman screamed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney demanded an apology from President Obama on Friday for making what he called ''reckless'' and ''absurd'' allegations in an escalating battle over whether Mr. Romney's business record included outsourcing American jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After days in which the Obama campaign persistently goaded Mr. Romney and even raised questions about whether he might have broken the law by lying on a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Romney finally hit back hard, giving five television interviews in which he said the attacks on him were ''beneath the dignity of the presidency.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What kind of a president would have a campaign that says something like that about the nominee of another party?'' Mr. Romney said to CBS News. In an interview with ABC News, he added: ''He sure as heck ought to say that he's sorry for the kinds of attacks that are coming from his team.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama showed no signs of backing down, and while avoiding the more provocative language used by some of his aides, said Mr. Romney should answer lingering questions about what his role was at Bain Capital, a private equity firm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think most Americans figure if you are the chairman, C.E.O. and president of a company that you are responsible for what that company does,'' Mr. Obama said on WJLA-TV in northern Virginia earlier in the day. ''Ultimately, Mr. Romney, I think, is going to have to answer those questions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The back and forth between the rivals for the presidency capped one of the most intense 48-hour periods of the 2012 campaign, with each side angrily accusing the other of outright lies and distortions as the election became a matchup of war-room tactics far removed from the big issues of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Romney has sought to keep public attention on the weak economy, Mr. Obama's team spent the week trying to focus the campaign on undermining Mr. Romney's claim to being an effective economic manager by highlighting reports that Bain Capital had invested in companies that moved jobs overseas. That battle in turn descended into a brawl over Mr. Romney's position that he had already left Bain during the period in question, starting in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney reiterated on Friday that he had no role in running Bain after early 1999, when he left to take over management of the Salt Lake City Olympic Games. The Boston Globe reported Thursday on S.E.C. documents listing Mr. Romney as chief executive of Bain through 2002, a period in which Mr. Romney has said he was negotiating his formal departure from the company but was not involved in its management or investment decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I was the owner of an entity which was a management entity,'' Mr. Romney said on CBS, calling the questions about Bain the ''height of silliness'' to be having. ''That entity was one which I had ownership of until the time of the retirement program was put in place. But I had no responsibility whatsoever after February of '99 for the management or ownership -- management, rather, of Bain Capital.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though he hit back hard at the president on Friday, Mr. Romney's willingness to plunge fully into the fray over the issue was a victory for Mr. Obama in the sense that the campaign spent another day being fought on the Obama campaign's choice of turf. As Mr. Romney himself said in an interview this week on Fox News, ''If you're responding, you're losing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney used the television interviews on Friday to try to shift attention back to the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You just had very bad news on the economic front, with now 41 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent,'' he told Fox News. ''And what does the president do? He says he is going to raise taxes on people. He is trying to gut welfare reform as we know it. And he launches attacks of this nature. Well, it is just beneath the dignity of his office.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the Obama forces apparently fully committed to portraying him as out of touch with the middle class and secretive about his wealth, Mr. Romney faced continuing questions about his willingness to disclose more information about his personal finances. He responded that he does not intend to disclose much more than he already has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney said he had released his 2010 tax return and would release his full 2011 tax return when it was ready. But he said voters should not expect any more than that, despite Democrats' calls for him to release a decade's worth of returns or more, citing the example of his father, George Romney, who when he ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968 released 12 years of returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I know there will always be calls for more. People always want to get more,'' Mr. Romney said on CNN. ''And, you know, we're putting out what is required plus more that is not required. And those are the two years that people are going to have. And that's -- that's all that's necessary for people to understand something about my finances.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is running millions of dollars in television ads calling on Mr. Romney to reveal more about his personal taxes, offshore bank accounts and investment accounts, and linking him to the investments made at Bain between 1999 and 2001, when Mr. Romney says he was no longer at the company. On Thursday, the president's aides said Mr. Romney was either lying on federal documents or to the American people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That allegation, in particular, has clearly angered Mr. Romney. He called the accusation of criminal behavior ''disgusting'' and ''demeaning'' and said it was destructive to the political process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's something that I think the president should take responsibility for and stop it,'' Mr. Romney said. ''Is this the level that the Obama campaign is willing to stoop to?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's rare appearances on five networks on Friday attested to his campaign's desire to respond to the president's charges. But the media blitz also highlighted how he is being outgunned at the moment in the advertising wars, where Mr. Obama's campaign is greatly outspending his in the states that will decide the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney has outraised Mr. Obama in the last several months, but most of the money he has raised can be used only in the general election, which formally begins after the Republican National Convention this summer. The long, contentious Republican primary campaign drained much of the money Mr. Romney could spend before then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That has left Mr. Romney somewhat short of cash, though the campaign is broadcasting advertisements this week slamming Mr. Obama for misleading attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By giving interviews to all the major networks, Mr. Romney is likely to ensure that clips will be replayed all weekend. And what he says is likely to be the subject of conversation during the Sunday morning news programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign has produced television ads this week charging Mr. Obama with running a dishonest campaign and using clips of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state, angrily denouncing Mr. Obama during the 2008 Democratic primaries for lying about her record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''So shame on you, Barack Obama,'' the ad says.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's campaign continued on Saturday to prosecute its case against Mitt Romney for holding offshore accounts, releasing a new television ad that mockingly shows Mr. Romney, the Republican candidate, singing &quot;America the Beautiful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's campaign has spent more than a week hammering Mr. Romney's personal wealth and calling on him to disclose more information about his personal finances by releasing his tax returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ad - which the campaign said was running in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia - reminds viewers of those issues even as it shows a clip of Mr. Romney singing at a campaign event in Florida earlier this year.<BR><BR>It says Mr. Romney shipped jobs to Mexico, China and India - accusations that Mr. Romney's campaign vehemently denies. And it notes that Mr. Romney had &quot;millions&quot; in a Swiss bank account and &quot;tax havens&quot; in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney's not the solution,&quot; the ad states. &quot;He's the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amanda Henneberg, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, said of the ad, &quot;As the failures of his presidency become more evident, Barack Obama has resorted to the tactics of a typical politician - dishonest and totally unsubstantiated attacks meant to distract from his own record by smearing the reputation of his opponent. The Obama campaign appears to be stuck in their own 'groundhog day,' repeating the same, debunked charges they've waged for weeks in an effort to distract voters from this administration's failure to fix the economy and create jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign has repeatedly defended the offshore accounts, saying that he paid all the taxes he was legally required to pay. On Friday, Mr. Romney again refused to release multiple years of his tax returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know there will always be calls for more.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's campaign has spent many months trying to portray Mitt Romney as an unprincipled flip-flopper, a panderer to right-wing extremists and a greedy business executive. Then this week the ante was upped when one Obama aide suggested that Romney may be something worse: a potential felon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest charge, made by deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter in a conference call with reporters, provoked immediate outrage from the Romney campaign, which, in the course of demanding an apology, called the president of the United States a habitual liar.          &quot;The facts are clear: President Obama has a pattern of running dishonest campaigns, and the American people deserve better,&quot; Amanda Henneberg, Romney's deputy press secretary, said in an e-mail Friday.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intensified hostility and persistent name-calling dominated the campaign news Friday and signaled that the presidential contest was entering a new phase, moving from relentlessly negative to downright nasty. And in a sign that the tactics were taking a toll on both sides, each candidate felt compelled to conduct a series of television interviews to respond to the criticisms from the other camp. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Cutter, citing media reports, questioned whether it was a potential felony for Bain Capital, the private equity firm Romney founded and led, to continue listing him as chief executive in filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission three years after he said he left, in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Either Mitt Romney, through his own words and his own signature, was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the SEC, which is a felony,&quot; Cutter said, &quot;Or he was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the American people to avoid responsibility for some of the consequences of his investments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the Washington ABC affiliate WJLA, Obama defended his campaign's tactics: &quot;Ultimately Mr. Romney, I think, is going to have to answer those questions,&quot; Obama said, &quot;because if he aspires to being president one of the things you learn is, you are ultimately responsible for the conduct of your operations. . . . That's probably a question that he's going to have to answer and I think that's a legitimate part of the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's campaign called the new attacks  &quot;reckless&quot; and said they were evidence that the Obama side was &quot;unraveling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But opinion polls suggest that Romney has been hurt by the Obama Bain attacks in key swing states and some Republican strategists have fretted openly that Romney has not responded forcefully enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, in a surprising move for a candidate who prefers tightly choreographed events, Romney sat down with five television networks to respond to the Obama attacks. Romney explained that he gave up managing Bain in 1999 and relinquished all control of the firm despite maintaining an &quot;ownership stake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This kind of statement from the Obama team is really shocking,&quot; Romney told CBS News, referring to the felony charge. &quot;It's ridiculous, and it's beneath the dignity of the presidency.&quot; On ABC News, Romney said Obama &quot;ought to say that he's sorry for the kinds of attacks that are coming from his team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racheting up of the rhetoric is perhaps a predictable consequence of millions of dollars in attack ads over the past several months. Elizabeth Wilner, a vice president of Kantar Media, which tracks political advertising, said nearly every advertisement run by the two campaigns across the country on Thursday was &quot;negative&quot; in tone and message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the sheer volume of those ads has, in some cases, doubled since four years ago. For example, the campaigns, along with the independent super PACs aligned with them, had run 1,640 television ads in Columbus, Ohio, a key battleground, in the first 12 days of July. That compares with 845 ads in 2008 and 462 in 2004, Wilner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a reason why people use negative ads - they work,&quot; Wilner said. &quot;People say they can't stand them and it turns them off. But while [the ads] may make people feel cynical about the process and sour them on politics, they eventually create an impression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, it was more of the same. Obama's campaign released a Web video titled &quot;Mitt Romney's Bain Secret Exposed,&quot; again questioning whether Romney relinquished control of the firm in 1999. And Romney's campaign countered with &quot;What Happened?&quot; using video clips of Obama denouncing personal attacks in 2008 to charge that he had strayed from his pledge to remain above the fray.In addition to the advertisements, the two sides have engaged in a constant cycle of taunting in which almost nothing is too petty for the campaign playground. On Friday, the Romney campaign bus circled a high school in Virginia Beach just before Obama arrived to give a speech. (At one Obama event in Cleveland last month, the Romney bus even honked its horn.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For its part, the Obama campaign has repeatedly ridiculed Romney for refusing to release 12 years of his tax returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney wants you to show your papers, but he won't show us his,&quot; Vice President Biden told Latino activists at the National Council of La Raza conference on Tuesday, simultaneously chiding the GOP challenger on his position on immigration and IRS disclosures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By no means has the 2012 campaign devolved into the nastiest on record. In fact, there is a long history of brutal presidential contests, said Gil Troy, a presidential historian from McGill University in Montreal who has written extensively on the subject. He cited Andrew Jackson being accused of murder and adultery in 1828 as but one example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, a political action committee supporting George H.W. Bush in 1988 produced the infamous &quot;Willie Horton ad&quot; that accused Democrat Michael Dukakis of being lenient on violent crime. And in 2004, an outside group called Swiftboat Veterans for Truth, aligned with George W. Bush, used an ad called &quot;Sellout&quot; to question challenger John F. Kerry's patriotism after the Vietnam War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The holy grail for American politics is the search for the substantive campaign,&quot; Troy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Troy said the Obama tactic reflected the &quot;joy people take in not just pummeling political opponents but criminalizing them&quot; in the post-Watergate, post-Iran-contra era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he warned that there are downsides to the strategy: &quot;If I were advising the Obama campaign, I'd tell them to be careful about going legal because it can backfire on you. Romney can then get on his high horse and say this should be a campaign of ideas instead of false accusations of legality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, too, has jumped at the chance to play up the GOP attacks against him. In his stump speech, the president has bemoaned the &quot;scary voices&quot; in the Republican ads that blame the sluggish economy on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the next four months, you will be bombarded with more negative ads,&quot; Obama told supporters at an elementary school in Poland, Ohio, last week. &quot;You've got these super PACs - millionaires, billionaires writing $10 million checks, just pouring - raining down on my head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all right!&quot; someone shouted sympathetically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is all right because I'm tough,&quot; Obama concurred. &quot;I'm skinny, but I'm tough.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney's campaign released a blistering television advertisement on Thursday accusing President Obama of dishonesty in recent attacks on Mr. Romney. It also has a somewhat off-topic cameo by Hillary Rodham Clinton in which she scolds Mr. Obama during the 2008 Democratic primary race. The ad is the latest to reach the depths of nastiness that have characterized the presidential contest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE SCRIPT ''When a president doesn't tell the truth, how can we trust him to lead? The Obama outsourcing attacks: 'misleading, unfair and untrue.' There was 'no evidence' that Mitt Romney shipped jobs overseas. Candidate Obama lied about Hillary Clinton. 'So shame on you, Barack Obama.' But America expects more from a president. Obama's dishonest campaign: another reason America has lost confidence in Barack Obama.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON SCREEN The first lines appear over grainy video of Mr. Obama speaking. Images of The Washington Post and of the Web site FactCheck.org appear behind quoted text. There is a video clip of Mrs. Clinton berating Mr. Obama in the heat of their 2008 primary race. The ad ends with Mr. Obama in rolled-up shirt sleeves mouthing words with no sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCURACY The ad, titled ''No Evidence,'' is the latest in an increasingly personal dispute between the campaigns over Mr. Romney's record at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded. The president has attacked Mr. Romney as an ''outsourcing pioneer'' because of investments he made at Bain, and an Obama campaign ad last month asked if Americans wanted an ''outsourcer in chief.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney&nbsp;ad quotes, correctly, a fact-checking column in The Post that was highly skeptical of the Obama&nbsp;ad. But the column appeared before a news article in The Post on June 21 that took a deeper look at Bain and identified companies that the firm had invested in that helped other companies move call centers and manufacturing overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney&nbsp;ad cites a second fact-checking column, by FactCheck.org, that found ''no evidence'' that Mr. Romney sent American jobs overseas while he was running Bain. That conclusion was based in part on the fact that Mr. Romney left Bain in 1999 to run the Salt Lake City Olympics, before two companies that Bain invested in moved work from the United States to Mexico, in 2000 and 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, that timeline was thrown into question by a report in The Boston Globe that securities filings named Mr. Romney as the owner, president and chief executive of Bain during the period. It is unclear whether he made hands-on decisions during that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCORECARD The two campaigns are entrenched in hand-to-hand combat over details and the significance of Mr. Romney's years at Bain, which is the source of his personal wealth and his top credential in billing himself as a leader capable of improving the economy. The Obama campaign has barraged Mr. Romney on his Bain record, to the point of distorting some facts. But it is unlikely to call off the assault, which some polls show has persuaded a slice of voters in swing states to doubt Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For weeks, President Obama's top campaign strategists have tried to establish that Mitt Romney was at the helm of Bain Capital when some of its companies moved workers overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proving his presence at Bain between 1999 and 2002 would create a direct link to what Mr. Obama's team describes as the outsourcing of American jobs. And it would contradict Mr. Romney's repeated assertions that by then he had left Bain, the private equity firm he founded, to rescue the Salt Lake City Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But definitive proof about Mr. Romney's activities remains elusive, leading to another day of increasingly bitter charges and countercharges from the two campaigns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday -- even as Mr. Romney started broadcasting a television commercial accusing the president of approving dishonest attacks -- Mr. Obama's campaign seized on a new report in The Boston Globe about Securities and Exchange Commission documents showing that Mr. Romney was listed as the chief executive, president and owner of Bain Capital during that period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's team moved with a fury, holding a 45-minute conference call with reporters to denounce what they called Mr. Romney's ''Bain lie.'' Stephanie Cutter, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Obama, said it seemed possible that Mr. Romney had committed a felony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Either Mitt Romney, through his own words and his own signature, was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the S.E.C., which is a felony,'' Ms. Cutter said, ''or he was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the American people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highly charged accusation once again put Mr. Romney and his allies on the defensive -- a position that has already caused consternation among his supporters in Washington. Matt Rhoades, the campaign manager for Mr. Romney, issued a blistering statement calling on Mr. Obama to apologize for Ms. Cutter's remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''President Obama's campaign hit a new low today when one of its senior advisers made a reckless and unsubstantiated charge to reporters about Mitt Romney that was so over the top that it calls into question the integrity of their entire campaign,'' Mr. Rhoades said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called Ms. Cutter part of an ''out of control'' staff working on Mr. Obama's behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even as Mr. Obama's campaign continued to trumpet The Globe's disclosures, other reports emerged on Thursday to support the Romney campaign's assertion that he did not have any operational control over Bain after 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement from Charlyn Lusk, a spokeswoman for Bain Capital, reiterated Mr. Romney's position that he ''has had absolutely no involvement with the management or investment activities of the firm or with any of its portfolio companies since the day of his departure'' in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Lusk said that ''due to the sudden nature of Mr. Romney's departure, he remained the sole stockholder for a time while formal ownership was being documented and transferred to the group of partners who took over management of the firm in 1999.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Accordingly,'' she added, ''Mr. Romney was reported in various capacities on S.E.C. filings during this period.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents obtained by Fortune magazine on Thursday appeared to bolster that contention. The magazine said on its Web site that it had obtained offering documents for funds that Bain Capital circulated in 2000 and 2001. The documents listed the managers of the funds. Mr. Romney's name was not on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Then there is Bain Capital Venture Fund -- the firm's first dedicated venture capital effort -- whose private placement memorandum is dated January 2001,'' the magazine wrote. ''Romney also isn't listed among its 'key investment professionals,' or as part of its day-to-day operations or investment committee.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney has said for years that once he left Bain, he was no longer actively involved in the firm's operations. (Though as a presidential candidate, he continues to claim credit for job growth years later at companies that Bain had invested in.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A biography of Mr. Romney published this year by reporters for The Boston Globe also seems to back up that account. The reporters described Mr. Romney's departure from Bain Capital in 1999 as ''not so neat'' and said that Mr. Romney and his partners ''squabbled over how the firm would operate without him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors said that a power struggle ensued over Mr. Romney's departure and described him as kneeling on the floor with one of his partners to pray for the business's survival. ''We were facing a crucial event that threatened the very existence [of] our firm's partnership,'' Bob Gay, the partner, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has so far been no contemporaneous evidence of Mr. Romney's active participation in management decisions during the period in question. No one has come forward to produce notes of meetings that Mr. Romney attended. There is no indication of conference calls or partnership meetings that he attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the lack of such evidence, Robert F. Bauer, the chief counsel for Mr. Obama's campaign, hinted that something like that might yet emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I would stay very much tuned on that,'' he said, adding that Mr. Romney could ask Bain Capital to release notes of meetings during that period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If more reports establish that Mr. Romney has been less than truthful about his time at Bain, the political damage to his presidential bid could be lasting. The issue plays into a larger storyline that the president's team is trying to create: that Mr. Romney is hiding things about his past and his wealth from the voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Romney's new television ad suggests a possible danger for Mr. Obama as well if voters conclude that the president has crossed an ethical line. In the ad, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state, is seen angrily denouncing Mr. Obama during the 2008 Democratic nominating contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Shame on you, Barack Obama,'' Mrs. Clinton says.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know whether this was the intention - one certainly assumes so - but the handful of new investigations into Mitt Romney's investment arrangements in Switzerland, Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands have come at a particularly interesting moment in the U.S. electoral cycle. With four months to go, both presidential candidates are frantically drawing lines in the sand: Each is arguing that he offers American voters a clear and distinct choice on health care, immigration, taxation - and that his opponent offers something quite different.           On purpose or otherwise, the tales of the Cayman Islands make clear that Romney and President Obama are offering American voters another kind of choice as well. One of the words most frequently deployed during the midterm elections and the now-forgotten Republican primaries was &quot;elite,&quot; usually as a term of opprobrium and usually by Republicans - but sometimes by Democrats, too.            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In running for the Senate, Christine O'Donnell  had a campaign ad that declared: &quot;I didn't go to Yale . . . I am YOU.&quot; Attacking Obama, Rand Paul called the president a &quot;liberal elitist&quot; who &quot;believes that he knows what is best for people.&quot; Occupy Wall Street rose up against the &quot;1 percent&quot; but fizzled out before it could propose an alternative. At one point, even Justice Clarence Thomas's wife railed against the Washington political class, leading columnist Dahlia Lithwick to wonder how that term could possibly exclude her husband (&quot;If ever there were nine people who are actually paid to think they know better than the rest of us, Supreme Court justices are it.&quot;).          Granted, the word elite  is often used, blurrily, to mean &quot;a group of people whose views I dislike.&quot; But that doesn't mean that elites don't exist. On the contrary, the previous debates on the subject were insufficiently subtle, failing to recognize that in the modern world, there are multiple elite groups, each with its own customs and habits, its own moral codes and its own domestic and international connections. And let us be clear: When we are offered the choice between Obama and Romney, we are offered a choice between two sets of them.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know the stereotypes already. Both Obamas come from what might loosely be called the intellectual/academic meritocracy, the &quot;liberal elite,&quot; the post-WASP Ivy League, easily caricatured as the world of free-trade coffee, organic arugula, smug opinions and Martha's Vineyard. The Romneys, by contrast, belong to the financial oligarchy, the &quot;global elite,&quot; the post-financial-deregulation world that is just as easily caricatured as one of iced champagne, offshore bank accounts, dressage trainers and private islands. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two groups have some important overlaps. Although Romney got some attention for holding a fundraiser in the Hamptons last week, Obama has raised more money in the Hamptons overall (the president scored particularly well in Sagaponack, by one account, where the median home price is $4.4 million).           They also have some important differences. The financial oligarchy, as we learned from the Barclays scandal in London last week, is happiest when it operates in deep secrecy, where it can manipulate interest rates, package derivatives, hide its profits and shelter its taxes as it sees fit. The liberal meritocracy prefers to operate in the glare of publicity, where it can give lectures, write books, make documentaries and generally promulgate its own views as loudly as possible. Aged 34, Obama wrote his autobiography. Aged 37, Romney founded Bain Capital.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while you might think one or the other group more preferable or more offensive for reasons of politics, culture or taste, you certainly cannot argue that either of them is in close touch with &quot;average&quot; or &quot;ordinary&quot; or even &quot;middle-class&quot; people, however those terms might be defined. And although they and their supporters may shout about &quot;radical left-wing professors&quot; on the one hand or &quot;Gordon Gekko&quot; on the other, neither Obama nor Romney can plausibly claim to leading a populist revolution against the &quot;elites&quot; who are allegedly destroying America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is just as well, because the political success of both Obama and Romney proves that radical populism in the United States has failed spectacularly. For all of the attention they got, neither Occupy Wall Street nor the tea party has a candidate in this race. Neither found a way to channel inchoate, ill-defined public anger - at the deficit, at the banks - into electoral politics or clear alternatives. Whoever wins in November, we'll therefore get the elite we deserve. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight over Bain Capital is heating up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney's campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, is calling on President Obama to apologize for his staff for &quot;a reckless and unsubstantiated charge . . . so over the top that it calls into question the integrity of their entire campaign.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter, along with Obama campaign lawyer Bob Bauer, argued Thursday that Romney may have lied to the Securities and Exchange Commission about leaving Bain in early 1999 to run the Salt Lake City Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their accusations were based on a Boston Globe article reporting that SEC filings show Romney controlled Bain through 2002. The date is important because Romney argues that he isn't responsible for outsourcing, job losses and bad deals that Bain had a hand in after 1999 - he was busy running the Salt Lake City Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cutter told reporters that Romney was either &quot;misrepresenting his own position at Bain to the SEC, which is a felony, or he was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bauer added that if Romney &quot;was not the controlling person that is described [in the filings], that means that these statements are false and . . . there are very, very serious legal consequences that would follow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cutter had a message aimed directly at Romney: &quot;If the SEC filings aren't accurate, prove it. . . . Prove it by releasing your tax returns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhoades wrote: &quot;President Obama ought to apologize for the out-of-control behavior of his staff, which demeans the office he holds. Campaigns are supposed to be hard fought, but statements like those made by Stephanie Cutter belittle the process and the candidate on whose behalf she works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aggressive statement goes along with a newly combative Romney campaign; earlier in the day the candidate released an ad calling Obama a liar.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             RICHMOND - President Obama's campaign bought nine ads to run on Richmond television during an Orioles-Nationals baseball game two Saturdays ago, but there was a hitch: For all of the ads to air, they would have needed to run virtually back to back in every commercial break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local Fox affiliate balked. &quot;We do our best to spread out our political ads and make sure our viewers don't feel like they're bombarded,&quot; said Steve Genett, general manager of WRLH.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after the station limited the Obama spots, baseball fans got plenty of politics, with six ads for Obama, one for Republican rival Mitt Romney and one for Democratic Senate candidate Timothy M. Kaine - all shoehorned into six local commercial breaks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The River City is enduring a presidential ad blitz like never before. A place long bypassed by presidential campaigns suddenly has one of the nation's most heavily saturated local TV markets. More than 140 times on an average day, an ominous voice-over warns Richmond area voters that their president is killing the economy or that Romney helped ship American jobs overseas. With about 1,000 such ads airing per week - unheard of in the state this early in a presidential campaign - the former Confederate capital hasn't felt so besieged since the Union Army was banging on the door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's late October in July,&quot; said Bob Holsworth, a retired Virginia Commonwealth University political science professor. &quot;You have back-to-back commercials, and it's hard to imagine the election is four months away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the siege will mean for the outcome in November is uncertain. But both campaigns see Virginia as a place where they must drive home their central messages - on the air and in person. For Obama, who will visit the Richmond suburbs Saturday as part of a two-day swing through the state, that has meant portraying Romney as &quot;_blankoutsourcer-in-chief.&quot; And for Romney, who hit Roanoke and Sterling late last month, that has meant casting the president as someone unable to lead the country out of recession.          The messages do not appear tailored to Virginia, where the state's 5.5 percent unemployment rate is well below the 8.2 percent national average. &quot;Blunt-force advertising&quot; is how Holsworth described the ads, meaning they are &quot;in keeping with the national message but don't seem necessarily calibrated to the special circumstances of Virginia.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even in Richmond's suburbs, there is economic anxiety to exploit. The campaigns and their allies seem to be betting that, with enough inundation, they'll break through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy could be working on Michael Broadway, 18, who lives with his parents in an upscale townhouse village built around a Whole Foods Market in Henrico County. He isn't sure who will get his vote - his first. But the ads accusing Romney of outsourcing jobs have caught his attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's probably the most interesting one,&quot; said Broadway, who plans to enter J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College this fall fall and is worried about his prospects after graduation. &quot;My parents are conservative, but one of the things that concerns me is outsourcing jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll suggests that Obama's outsourcing ads - though criticized by The Post's Fact Checker as misleading - may have swayed some voters in Virginia and seven other swing states. Compared with February, more voters in those states say Romney cut more jobs than he created while at private-equity firm Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Romney was making headway with an ad promising to repeal &quot;Obamacare&quot; on Day One of his presidency and to bring new jobs to Virginia by lifting Obama's offshore drilling ban. That appeals to Jayne Perala, a 63-year-old retired first-grade teacher, who is unsure about the new health care law and offshore drilling but simply likes the can-do confidence Romney's&nbsp;ad projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perala lives in Roanoke, another area inundated with ads. That part of Virginia and the Southside region just beyond lost manufacturing decades ago to overseas factories. Obama's Bain attacks might be expected to play well there. But in her days as a teacher, Perala always enjoyed job security. &quot;Things have always been rosy,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet now in retirement, she has properties for sale in a weak real estate market. There's a nagging, long-term worry that's made her receptive to a take-charge Romney&nbsp;ad. &quot;There's something calming and reassuring,&quot; said Perala, who remains undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For two months, Richmond has averaged nearly 1,000 presidential TV spots a week - hitting a high of 1,482 ads during the last week in June, according to the ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG. That's nearly 10 times the 151 ads that aired here the same time four years ago. And it surpasses the 1,251 spots at the height of that race in October 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're just bombarded with, 'I'm President Obama and I approve this ad,' and for that matter, Romney, too,&quot; said Russell Batten, 51, a Republican small-business owner and father of eight in Goochland County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same sentiment can be heard inside the Yarn Lounge, a Richmond knitting hangout where clerk Karen Gilman carries a &quot;Knitters for Obama&quot; bag with the candidate's logo recast as a ball of yarn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I hear one more time, 'You should be ashamed of yourself, Mr. Obama,' I told my husband I'm going to go out and buy all new TVs, because I'll have smashed them,&quot; said Gilman, referring to a _blankRomney ad with a clip of Hillary Rodham Clinton scolding her 2008 primary opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flurry of ads comes as a shock to Richmond, capital of a state so reliably Republican that presidential campaigns bypassed it for decades. Lots of TV ads helped Obama snap the Democrats' 40-year losing streak, but only later in the campaign. Republican John McCain lacked money for a counterpunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This time, we're seeing both,&quot; said Jeff Ryer, spokesman for the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richmond had the most presidential television advertising of any media market in Virginia last week, with 985 spots. Norfolk finished close behind with 979, then Roanoke with 667. Just 180 ads aired in the Washington market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigns and PACs spent nearly the same amount that week in Richmond and Washington markets - $213,670 in Washington and $232,300 in Richmond - but that bought five times as many ads in Virginia's capital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight over Bain Capital is heating up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney's campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, is calling on President Obama to apologize for his staff for &quot;a reckless and unsubstantiated charge . . . so over the top that it calls into question the integrity of their entire campaign.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter, along with Obama campaign lawyer Bob Bauer, argued Thursday that Romney may have lied to the Securities and Exchange Commission about leaving Bain in early 1999 to run the Salt Lake City Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their accusations were based on a Boston Globe article reporting that SEC filings show Romney controlled Bain through 2002. The date is important because Romney argues that he isn't responsible for outsourcing, job losses and bad deals that Bain had a hand in after 1999 - he was busy running the Salt Lake City Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cutter told reporters that Romney was either &quot;misrepresenting his own position at Bain to the SEC, which is a felony, or he was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bauer added that if Romney &quot;was not the controlling person that is described [in the filings], that means that these statements are false and . . . there are very, very serious legal consequences that would follow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cutter had a message aimed directly at Romney: &quot;If the SEC filings aren't accurate, prove it. . . . Prove it by releasing your tax returns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhoades wrote: &quot;President Obama ought to apologize for the out-of-control behavior of his staff, which demeans the office he holds. Campaigns are supposed to be hard fought, but statements like those made by Stephanie Cutter belittle the process and the candidate on whose behalf she works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aggressive statement goes along with a newly combative Romney campaign; earlier in the day the candidate released an ad calling Obama a liar.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">RICHMOND</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RICHMOND - President Obama's campaign bought nine ads to run on Richmond television during an Orioles-Nationals baseball game two Saturdays ago, but there was a hitch: For all of the ads to air, they would have needed to run virtually back to back in every commercial break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local Fox affiliate balked. &quot;We do our best to spread out our political ads and make sure our viewers don't feel like they're bombarded,&quot; said Steve Genett, general manager of WRLH.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after the station limited the Obama spots, baseball fans got plenty of politics, with six ads for Obama, one for Republican rival Mitt Romney and one for Democratic Senate candidate Timothy M. Kaine - all shoehorned into six local commercial breaks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The River City is enduring a presidential ad blitz like never before. A place long bypassed by presidential campaigns suddenly has one of the nation's most heavily saturated local TV markets. More than 140 times on an average day, an ominous voice-over warns Richmond area voters that their president is killing the economy or that Romney helped ship American jobs overseas. With about 1,000 such ads airing per week - unheard of in the state this early in a presidential campaign - the former Confederate capital hasn't felt so besieged since the Union Army was banging on the door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's late October in July,&quot; said Bob Holsworth, a retired Virginia Commonwealth University political science professor. &quot;You have back-to-back commercials, and it's hard to imagine the election is four months away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the siege will mean for the outcome in November is uncertain. But both campaigns see Virginia as a place where they must drive home their central messages - on the air and in person. For Obama, who will visit the Richmond suburbs Saturday as part of a two-day swing through the state, that has meant portraying Romney as &quot;_blankoutsourcer-in-chief.&quot; And for Romney, who hit Roanoke and Sterling late last month, that has meant casting the president as someone unable to lead the country out of recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The messages do not appear tailored to Virginia, where the state's 5.5 percent unemployment rate is well below the 8.2 percent national average. &quot;Blunt-force advertising&quot; is how Holsworth described the ads, meaning they are &quot;in keeping with the national message but don't seem necessarily calibrated to the special circumstances of Virginia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even in Richmond's suburbs, there is economic anxiety to exploit. The campaigns and their allies seem to be betting that, with enough inundation, they'll break through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy could be working on Michael Broadway, 18, who lives with his parents in an upscale townhouse village built around a Whole Foods Market in Henrico County. He isn't sure who will get his vote - his first. But the ads accusing Romney of outsourcing jobs have caught his attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's probably the most interesting one,&quot; said Broadway, who plans to enter J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College this fall fall and is worried about his prospects after graduation. &quot;My parents are conservative, but one of the things that concerns me is outsourcing jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll suggests that Obama's outsourcing ads - though criticized by The Post's Fact Checker as misleading - may have swayed some voters in Virginia and seven other swing states. Compared with February, more voters in those states say Romney cut more jobs than he created while at private-equity firm Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Romney was making headway with an ad promising to repeal &quot;Obamacare&quot; on Day One of his presidency and to bring new jobs to Virginia by lifting Obama's offshore drilling ban. That appeals to Jayne Perala, a 63-year-old retired first-grade teacher, who is unsure about the new health care law and offshore drilling but simply likes the can-do confidence Romney's&nbsp;ad projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perala lives in Roanoke, another area inundated with ads. That part of Virginia and the Southside region just beyond lost manufacturing decades ago to overseas factories. Obama's Bain attacks might be expected to play well there. But in her days as a teacher, Perala always enjoyed job security. &quot;Things have always been rosy,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet now in retirement, she has properties for sale in a weak real estate market. There's a nagging, long-term worry that's made her receptive to a take-charge Romney&nbsp;ad. &quot;There's something calming and reassuring,&quot; said Perala, who remains undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For two months, Richmond has averaged nearly 1,000 presidential TV spots a week - hitting a high of 1,482 ads during the last week in June, according to the ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG. That's nearly 10 times the 151 ads that aired here the same time four years ago. And it surpasses the 1,251 spots at the height of that race in October 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're just bombarded with, 'I'm President Obama and I approve this ad,' and for that matter, Romney, too,&quot; said Russell Batten, 51, a Republican small-business owner and father of eight in Goochland County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same sentiment can be heard inside the Yarn Lounge, a Richmond knitting hangout where clerk Karen Gilman carries a &quot;Knitters for Obama&quot; bag with the candidate's logo recast as a ball of yarn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I hear one more time, 'You should be ashamed of yourself, Mr. Obama,' I told my husband I'm going to go out and buy all new TVs, because I'll have smashed them,&quot; said Gilman, referring to a _blankRomney ad with a clip of Hillary Rodham Clinton scolding her 2008 primary opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flurry of ads comes as a shock to Richmond, capital of a state so reliably Republican that presidential campaigns bypassed it for decades. Lots of TV ads helped Obama snap the Democrats' 40-year losing streak, but only later in the campaign. Republican John McCain lacked money for a counterpunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This time, we're seeing both,&quot; said Jeff Ryer, spokesman for the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richmond had the most presidential television advertising of any media market in Virginia last week, with 985 spots. Norfolk finished close behind with 979, then Roanoke with 667. Just 180 ads aired in the Washington market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigns and PACs spent nearly the same amount that week in Richmond and Washington markets - $213,670 in Washington and $232,300 in Richmond - but that bought five times as many ads in Virginia's capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past eight weeks, Norfolk has aired slightly more ads than Richmond, 8,003 spots compared with 7,890. That puts Norfolk at No. 5 and Richmond at No. 6 nationally for the number of presidential ads over that period. Only Las Vegas (10,681), Cleveland (10,317), Denver (9,156) and Orlando (8,207) had more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One night on Letterman, I remember every ad was a political ad,&quot; said Ryer, who tunes in Norfolk stations on the six televisions in his Williamsburg home. &quot;It's just incredible. If it weren't for the car dealers, I think it would be everything we're looking at. But thankfully somebody still wants to sell a Ford.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know whether this was the intention - one certainly assumes so - but the handful of new investigations into Mitt Romney's investment arrangements in Switzerland, Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands have come at a particularly interesting moment in the U.S. electoral cycle. With four months to go, both presidential candidates are frantically drawing lines in the sand: Each is arguing that he offers American voters a clear and distinct choice on health care, immigration, taxation - and that his opponent offers something quite different. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On purpose or otherwise, the tales of the Cayman Islands make clear that Romney and President Obama are offering American voters another kind of choice as well. One of the words most frequently deployed during the midterm elections and the now-forgotten Republican primaries was &quot;elite,&quot; usually as a term of opprobrium and usually by Republicans - but sometimes by Democrats, too.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In running for the Senate, Christine O'Donnellhad a campaign ad that declared: &quot;I didn't go to Yale . . . I am YOU.&quot; Attacking Obama, Rand Paul called the president a &quot;liberal elitist&quot; who &quot;believes that he knows what is best for people.&quot; Occupy Wall Street rose up against the &quot;1 percent&quot; but fizzled out before it could propose an alternative. At one point, even Justice Clarence Thomas's wife railed against the Washington political class, leading columnist Dahlia Lithwick to wonder how that term could possibly exclude her husband (&quot;If ever there were nine people who are actually paid to think they know better than the rest of us, Supreme Court justices are it.&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granted, the word elite  is often used, blurrily, to mean &quot;a group of people whose views I dislike.&quot; But that doesn't mean that elites don't exist. On the contrary, the previous debates on the subject were insufficiently subtle, failing to recognize that in the modern world, there are multiple elite groups, each with its own customs and habits, its own moral codes and its own domestic and international connections. And let us be clear: When we are offered the choice between Obama and Romney, we are offered a choice between two sets of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know the stereotypes already. Both Obamas come from what might loosely be called the intellectual/academic meritocracy, the &quot;liberal elite,&quot; the post-WASP Ivy League, easily caricatured as the world of free-trade coffee, organic arugula, smug opinions and Martha's Vineyard. The Romneys, by contrast, belong to the financial oligarchy, the &quot;global elite,&quot; the post-financial-deregulation world that is just as easily caricatured as one of iced champagne, offshore bank accounts, dressage trainers and private islands. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two groups have some important overlaps. Although Romney got some attention for holding a fundraiser in the Hamptons last week, Obama has raised more money in the Hamptons overall (the president scored particularly well in Sagaponack, by one account, where the median home price is $4.4 million). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also have some important differences. The financial oligarchy, as we learned from the Barclays scandal in London last week, is happiest when it operates in deep secrecy, where it can manipulate interest rates, package derivatives, hide its profits and shelter its taxes as it sees fit. The liberal meritocracy prefers to operate in the glare of publicity, where it can give lectures, write books, make documentaries and generally promulgate its own views as loudly as possible. Aged 34, Obama wrote his autobiography. Aged 37, Romney founded Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while you might think one or the other group more preferable or more offensive for reasons of politics, culture or taste, you certainly cannot argue that either of them is in close touch with &quot;average&quot; or &quot;ordinary&quot; or even &quot;middle-class&quot; people, however those terms might be defined. And although they and their supporters may shout about &quot;radical left-wing professors&quot; on the one hand or &quot;Gordon Gekko&quot; on the other, neither Obama nor Romney can plausibly claim to leading a populist revolution against the &quot;elites&quot; who are allegedly destroying America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is just as well, because the political success of both Obama and Romney proves that radical populism in the United States has failed spectacularly. For all of the attention they got, neither Occupy Wall Street nor the tea party has a candidate in this race. Neither found a way to channel inchoate, ill-defined public anger - at the deficit, at the banks - into electoral politics or clear alternatives. Whoever wins in November, we'll therefore get the elite we deserve. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A single company purchased more than 50,000 Hewlett-Packard computers last year, buying in bulk to shave millions of dollars off its costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was not General Electric, Procter &amp; Gamble or another large, multinational conglomerate with the muscle to dictate prices to suppliers. Rather, the big buyer was the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private equity firms like Blackstone are emerging as a powerful new force in the marketplace. The big investors, which collectively oversee thousands of companies, are using their size and scope to pressure suppliers, set their own prices and exert their influence in a range of industries, including health care, construction and consumer goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Blackstone was part of a group of companies that collectively bought 16 million reams of copy paper, 35 million FedEx shipments and 900,000 days' worth of rental cars from National and Avis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have incredible leverage,'' said James A. Quella, Blackstone's North American head of portfolio operations. ''The more volume we have, the lower our prices go.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, private equity firms like Blackstone have been viewed as financial alchemists who buy undervalued companies, rejigger their balance sheets and sell them for quick gain. In good times, the strategy worked. Buyout specialists could turn a tidy profit in a matter of months, without getting deeply involved in the businesses they owned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence the ''barbarians at the gate'' stereotype, which has arisen again in recent months as the presidential election has brought the private equity debate into sharp focus. Critics of the industry have faulted Mitt Romney, the presumed Republican candidate, for his years of running Bain Capital, a large buyout firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry players have been cast as job destroyers more concerned with making money for investors than improving the companies they own. One particularly critical ad for the Obama campaign featured a company, GST Steel, that went out of business years after it was taken over by Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the financial crisis, the decline of stocks markets and the sputtering recovery, private equity has been adapting its ways. While profit remains central and layoffs can still be part of the private equity equation, buyout firms are now stuck holding on to companies longer than expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the firms cannot operate at arm's length anymore and instead have had to roll up their sleeves and become full-fledged operators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The private equity titans have huge economic influence and sway, largely because of the size of their portfolios. Blackstone owns all or part of 74 companies that employ 700,000 people and generate $117 billion in annual revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken collectively, Blackstone's businesses would rank as the 13th largest company by revenue, ahead of JPMorgan Chase, I.B.M. and Procter &amp; Gamble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, another megafirm, would be No. 5 on that list with its 74 portfolio companies and $210 billion in aggregate revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Carlyle Group has investments in 200 portfolio companies, including Dunkin' Brands and Hertz, that collectively employ around 675,000 people - more than General Motors and General Electric combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Historically, private equity firms were about financial engineering,'' said Jason Busch, managing director at Spend Matters, a research firm that focuses on the procurement processes of big corporations. ''That's the fairy tale story from 25 or 30 years ago. Within the last decade, there's been more operational work to do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blackstone and others are taking the cues from the likes of General Electric. Decades ago, G.E. started buying in bulk for its various businesses units, including aerospace, energy, consumer and finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the disparate industries spread across dozens of countries, G.E. decided to make buying decisions at the corporate level, as a way to save money and bolster profits. Today, most large multinational companies adhere to a similar strategy for their supply chain, buying computers, office supplies and all types of products at a discount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, private equity firms are too. Both Blackstone and K.K.R. belong to a group purchasing program called CoreTrust, which has roughly 200 member companies including TPG Capital, Bain Capital, and other private equity firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program, which began in 2006, helps companies save 10 to 50 percent on common items, and even lets them stay enrolled after they are sold or taken public by their private equity owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's just common sense,'' said Todd Cooper, head of procurement for K.K.R., which uses CoreTrust for some bulk purchases. ''Every company, whether I'm a manufacturer or a retailer, uses FedEx. Everybody needs laptops.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those savings can add up. Blackstone says it has saved $600 million since 2006 through CoreTrust, direct supplier relationships and an equity health care group, which applies the same group purchasing principles to employee health insurance plans. K.K.R. pegs its total savings at north of $700 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's a phenomenal benefit,'' said Chris Karkenny, the chief financial officer of Apria, a health care company that was acquired by Blackstone in 2008 and has since used CoreTrust to buy telecommunications equipment, office supplies and other goods. ''We do just over $2 billion in revenue, but we're getting rates that companies with $100 billion in revenue would get.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2005, Mr. Quella of Blackstone recruited Gregory Beutler, a former G.E. executive, to help Blackstone drive down prices in its biggest spending categories. The two set a goal of saving $100 million a year through bulk-buying. They immediately began reaching out to the company's suppliers, telling them that they were to treat Blackstone's myriad businesses like one giant conglomerate, and set their prices accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We went to U.P.S. and FedEx,'' Mr. Quella said. ''We said, 'Guys, we just did an analysis: our smallest company is paying $9.95 for overnight. Our largest company is paying $6.95 for overnight. You guys charge whatever you get away with. We want one price, and we want that price to be the price you give your biggest customer.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hardball tactic worked. ''We negotiate them to the wall,'' Mr. Beutler said of Blackstone's suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another cost-cutting tactic is the reverse e-auction. In the eBay-style process, suppliers are given a set period of time, typically an hour, to bid against one another for a large contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, when Emdeon, a medical data provider owned by Blackstone, wanted to renegotiate a contract for a type of large, 112-pound paper rolls it uses to print medical claim statements and customer bills, Mr. Beutler organized a one-hour e-auction involving four paper makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Quella and Mr. Beutler watched eagerly from their desks as the bids began at $47.43 a roll, then fell as companies began lowering their prices. When the auction ended, a late bid of $45.87 a roll had won out. The savings were small by group purchasing standards, only about 3 percent of a contract that averages around $3.5 million annually. But at the scale of private equity, every dollar counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Ten percent of a big number is a big number,'' Mr. Quella explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While e-auctions and other aggressive negotiating tactics save money for private equity firms, they often put suppliers in a bind: should they lose out on a large contract, or win it and make the narrowest of profit margins?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It almost is a necessary evil,'' said Anthony C. Chukumba, an analyst for BB&amp;T Capital Markets. ''You want the business. But if you bid so low and then win a contract, then you have something that is only marginally profitable.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some large private equity firms choose not to participate in programs like CoreTrust, typically because they believe the group purchasing process strains relationships with suppliers, and requires them to micromanage companies in exchange for relatively small savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private equity-owned companies, too, have raised objections to group purchasing programs, which often require them to change suppliers from the ones they have used for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's difficult to break companies out of their mindsets,'' said Justin Hillenbrand, a partner at Monomoy Capital Partners, a midmarket private equity firm that uses a group purchasing program for its portfolio companies. ''Maybe they've been using U.P.S. forever, and because of that U.P.S. gives them favors; maybe it delivers things at odd hours. Guess what? If my purchasing program can get FedEx for 25 percent cheaper, they're going to switch.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one meeting, Mr. Quella of Blackstone said, the chief executive of a portfolio company expressed his frustration that the firm's group purchasing plan would force him to switch the brand of toilet paper his company used in its bathrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, group purchasing advocates defend their work as a necessary part of private equity's fat-trimming process. Blackstone and K.K.R., rival firms in almost every sense, are now teaming up to introduce CoreTrust to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As group purchasing programs grow, they will have to tread lightly, finding a balance in getting the prices they want and not angering the companies they own, or their suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's one thing to fool with the balance sheet of a company - it's another to change its operations,'' said Mr. Busch of Spend Matters. ''It's absolutely about rolling up your sleeves, but it's about having soft hands as well.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section A; Column 0; National Desk; THE AD CAMPAIGN; Pg. 12</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">499 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's campaign has unveiled an attack ad arguing that Mitt Romney's tax plan is a sop to the wealthy. The ad will run in swing states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE SCRIPT ''The choice on taxes. Mitt Romney's plan: A 25 percent tax cut for millionaires. Tax breaks for oil companies and corporations that shift jobs overseas. But a tax hike for 18 million working families. President Obama's plan: Ask the wealthy to pay a little more so the middle class pays less. Eliminate oil subsidies and tax breaks for companies that outsource. Two plans. Your choice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON SCREEN The ad shows Mr. Romney giving a speech and then cuts to a montage that includes an aerial shot of a large beachfront home, an Exxon logo and an overseas workplace. Mr. Obama is then shown shaking hands with people at a rally, laughing with workers at a plant, speaking with elderly people and then walking confidently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCURACY One of the ad's main claims -- that Mr. Romney's plan would raise taxes for 18 million working families -- is accurate, according to data from the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Assuming the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and alternative minimum tax relief, those taxpayers who would see their federal tax bills rise under the Romney plan (almost 11 percent of all filers) would have an average increase of $885, the center found. The overwhelming number of people in this category make less than $50,000, and they would see tax increases under the Romney plan because of the expiration of three provisions passed in 2009, including the expansion of the earned-income tax credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad does not mention that about 118 million filers would get a tax cut under the Romney plan. That includes nearly everyone making $100,000 or more, as well as about 77 percent of those making $30,000 to $40,000, for example, and 94 percent of those making $50,000 to $75,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad's other main claim -- that ''millionaires'' would get a 25 percent cut in their average tax rate -- is also accurate, the data suggests. According to Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings center, the average federal tax rate on incomes over $1 million would fall to 23.3 percent from 31.4 percent under the Romney plan, a roughly one-quarter decline. (Mr. Williams emphasized that the Romney campaign has also promised to broaden the tax base but has not said how it would do this, making it impossible to fully analyze their plan.) As for the Obama plan, he said that middle-class taxes would not change while wealthier taxpayers would pay more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCORECARD Mr. Romney is basing much of his campaign on the idea that he is an accomplished and skilled businessman who could deal effectively with the nation's economic problems. The ad seeks to undermine this claim by trying to paint Mr. Romney as an ally of the wealthy and corporations, including those that have sent American jobs overseas. RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney and his team of advisers built a reputation during the Republican primaries as tough street fighters skilled in the tactics of political warfare. They quietly took pride in tearing apart Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and the rest of their rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aggressive posture ultimately became one of Mr. Romney's selling points, particularly among conservative voters who were searching for the candidate tenacious enough to take out President Obama in the general election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, even with polls suggesting he is battling Mr. Obama to a draw at this stage of the race, Mr. Romney finds himself confronting concern that he is not nimble and aggressive enough to withstand the Democratic assault against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president and his re-election campaign have managed to turn the focus of the race in recent days to taxes, outsourcing jobs and Mr. Romney's bank accounts -- almost everything except the weak job-creation figures released last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That has stirred worries among some Republicans that Mr. Romney is allowing himself to be defined by the Obama forces and that he lacks the kind of powerful counterpunch the base of the Republican Party is craving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now deep into his second run for the White House, Mr. Romney has shown consistent discipline, sticking doggedly to his strategy of making the election about Mr. Obama's stewardship of the economy and for the most part avoiding being baited into traps set for him by rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If you're responding, you're losing,'' Mr. Romney told Fox News on Wednesday, his voice betraying no air of concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the latest Democratic offensive has become so intense that the Romney campaign will start a new wave of television commercials on Thursday, aides said. In a rapid-fire era of presidential politics, when candidates have the ability to respond at a moment's notice, the restraint of the Romney campaign over the last two weeks has opened a round of second-guessing about his insistent focus on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives have lit up talk radio programs across the country, worrying whether Mr. Romney's business record has been ''Swift Boated,'' referring to attacks waged against Senator John Kerry's military record in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign headquarters in Boston has been inundated with advice and criticism from donors and supporters who worry that Mr. Romney has lost an opportunity to introduce himself on his own terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Team Obama is doing just what we did in 2004, which is to define the opposition furiously and early,'' said Mark McKinnon, a strategist who worked on George W. Bush's re-election campaign. ''Most voters don't have a deep sense of Romney other than he's not Obama. And in this cycle, that may be enough, but it's a very risky approach.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four months until Election Day, much of the Republican Party's base is boiling hot. The latest example came on Wednesday, when the House held a symbolic vote to repeal the national health care law upheld last month by the Supreme Court. But Mr. Romney was in Houston speaking to the N.A.A.C.P. convention, a sign that he is trying to adhere to his own strategy of working to broaden his appeal to independent and undecided voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As his business record and tenure as Massachusetts governor was being relentlessly assailed in television commercials across a range of top battleground states, Mr. Romney released a Spanish-language ad on Wednesday that featured his son Craig. He delivered a testimonial about his father, whom he called ''a man of great convictions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advisers to Mr. Romney acknowledge that the questions about his record and wealth have contributed to a climb in his unfavorable rating among voters. But the campaign does not believe that the overall position of the race has changed, with voters still seeking an alternative to Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Obama has outspent Mr. Romney in battleground states, outside Republican groups have nearly evened the disparity. But the advertising from the major Republican ''super PACs,'' Crossroads and Restore Our Future, are aimed at highlighting the president's economic record, rather than defending Mr. Romney. Officials close to both groups said Wednesday that they had no plans to change their approach to help defend Mr. Romney against the Democratic-led attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Romney largely avoided an early round of recriminations that often comes after winning a party's contentious nominating fight, his advisers are feeling it now among some Republicans who worry that he is not taking full advantage of the chance to defeat Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some think he botched his chance to capitalize on the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the individual mandate portion of Mr. Obama's health care law when his campaign contradicted itself, calling the mandate first ''a penalty'' and only later ''a tax.'' Others hoped he would have already responded more forcefully to recent attacks by the Obama campaign on his time at Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas said the Romney campaign ''should continue to hammer away'' on a message of economic growth and job creation and ignore the commentary from conservative critics. He said Republicans would continue to rally behind Mr. Romney because of their strong desire to win back the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm not overly worried,'' Mr. Huckabee said Wednesday in an interview. ''Overall, the Romney campaign is being very disciplined, saving their fire until the convention.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, who is nearing the final stages of his search for a vice president and preparing to take a foreign trip at the end of the month, is devoting only a portion of his time to attending campaign events, further limiting his ability to control the narrative of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spent much of last week on vacation with his family in Wolfeboro, N.H., where he has a lake house. He is scheduled to return to there this weekend and is not planning any public events, while the president sets off on a two-day campaign trip across Virginia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Just as back in January during the nominating fight, Mitt Romney faces withering attacks on his record and past statements. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in January, Mitt Romney faced a series of politically searing moments, any one of which had the potential to bring a swift end to his second bid for the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Republican rivals tore into his role as the founder of Bain Capital, calling him a vulture capitalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They demanded that Mr. Romney release his tax returns, raising the question of whether Mr. Romney had used overseas tax havens that allow the  mega-rich to dodge what they really owe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they jumped on Mr. Romney's gaffes, twisting his own words -- &quot;I'm not concerned about the very poor&quot; -- to score political points in the bruising nominating fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, aides to Mr. Romney and veteran political observers found a silver lining: If he could survive the attacks and become the party's nominee, the thinking went, he would be stronger for it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The positive thinking was built on two premises:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, that any controversy that flared up in January would become old news by summertime, making it less likely that President Obama and his Democratic allies could make hay of it in the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And second, that Mr. Romney would be forced to find good, strong answers to the criticisms. There would be nothing left, they predicted, that could catch Mr. Romney off guard or unprepared when he faced Mr. Obama's disciplined and aggressive campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Times article in mid-January, Mr. Romney's advisers indicated they &quot;believe that this criticism could help inoculate him against similar Democratic-led attacks if he becomes the Republican nominee, since the story of Bain Capital could be well-worn by then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It hasn't quite worked out that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues of Mr. Romney's taxes, his time at Bain Capital and his string of verbal gaffes during the primaries have become the centerpieces of the Democratic attempt to define him as rich, out of touch and unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. Romney's campaign has made surprisingly little progress since the winter in finding effective responses to the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, Mr. Obama's campaign and his Democratic allies began an all-out effort to revive the questions about Mr. Romney's personal wealth and his refusal to make more than one full year of tax returns public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A web video released by Mr. Obama's campaign uses the words of Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, to cut to the heart of the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only real difference that I hear between investing in Cayman Islands or investing in the United States, or the only way that the Cayman Island investments are superior, is the possibility of avoiding U.S. tax,&quot; the senator says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Mr. Romney and his campaign have said what he said back in January -- that he has done nothing wrong and has paid all the taxes he owed. And as he did during the primaries, Mr. Romney has sought to shift the focus back to his opponent, in this case by accusing Mr. Obama of trying to keep documents secret in the Congressional investigation of gun-running on the Mexican border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad he wants to talk about transparency,&quot; Mr. Romney said on Fox News, &quot;because he has used executive privilege to prevent the American people from knowing the truth of what happened with the Fast and Furious program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is the Democratic attacks on Mr. Romney that have come fast and furious in the last several months. In most cases, they are revivals of the very issues that Mr. Romney's strategists thought they might have put to rest in the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polling shows the race between Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama to be virtually tied. But buoyed by surveys suggesting the attacks are working, Mr. Obama and his allies are continuing to question Mr.<BR>Romney's work at Bain Capital. The fact that Newt Gingrich and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas seized on the same issue in January and February hardly seems to have lessened its impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In part, that's because Mr. Obama's team has found a new way to frame the subject. After initially duplicating the corporate raider theme from the Republicans, Mr. Obama's campaign has more recently used the Bain years to accuse Mr. Romney of investing in companies that moved jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That new angle -- and millions of dollars to publicize the issue with television commercials -- breathed new life into the Bain attacks. And as the Times's Jeff Zeleny and Ashley Parker report Thursday, Mr.<BR>Romney's responses have caused some handwringing among some members of his party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's discipline as a candidate has improved in recent months.<BR>Since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, he has made fewer of the verbal gaffes that seemed to blunt his momentum at every turn during the nominating fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even those moments are not buried in the past. In one interview in early February, Mr. Romney said that he was &quot;not concerned with the very poor.&quot; In context, he was arguing for a focus on the middle class, not the rich or the poor. But his Republican rivals pounced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, that dormant phrase is back. A new Spanish-language television ad by a pro-Obama &quot;Super PAC&quot; and a union group shows Mr. Romney uttering that sentence, followed by a man speaking in Spanish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a person without feelings who doesn't care about people whether they be Hispanic, Latino, white, who are below him,&quot; the person says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other verbal miscues -- including when Mr. Romney said that corporations are people, too -- also remain potent rhetorical weapons that Democrats continue to use on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some public polling suggests that the attacks on Mr. Romney's Bain experience are working to make him less likable among important groups of swing voters. But that evidence is hardly overwhelming, and the Republican candidate still has plenty of time to find ways to respond effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is little doubt now that the &quot;glass half-full&quot; attitude among some of Mr. Romney's supporters six months ago has faded. The attacks by Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Perry and the other Republican candidates did not inoculate Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the fact that his campaign is still searching for the best way to respond suggests that all the practice in the world during months of intra-party squabbles did not help that much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. Romney were asked, it's likely he would have preferred not to go through that in the first place.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5:47 p.m. | Updated Mitt Romney's campaign released a blistering television advertisement on Thursday accusing President Obama of dishonesty in recent attacks on Mr. Romney. It also features a somewhat off-topic cameo by Hillary Clinton scolding Mr. Obama during the 2008 Democratic primary. The ad is the latest in the depths of nastiness that the presidential contest has already reached this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, titled &quot;No Evidence,&quot; is the latest in an increasingly personal dispute between the campaigns over Mr. Romney's record at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded. While campaigning, the president has attacked Mr. Romney as an &quot;outsourcing pioneer'' because of investments he made at Bain, and an Obama for America ad last month asked if Americans wanted an &quot;outsourcer-in-chief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Click on a subsection below to jump to a fact check. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YouTube</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">0:06&nbsp;&nbsp;Obama Outsourcing Attacks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad quotes, correctly, a fact-checking column in The Washington Post that was highly skeptical of an Obama for America ad last month that asked if Americans wanted an &quot;outsourcer-in-chief.&quot; But the column appeared before a news article in The Post on June 21 that took a deeper look at Bain and identified companies the firm invested in that helped other companies move call centers and manufacturing overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">0:11&nbsp; FactCheck.Org Findings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad cites a second fact-checking column, by FactCheck.org, which found &quot;no evidence&quot; Mr. Romney sent American jobs overseas while he was running Bain. That conclusion was based in part on the fact that Mr. Romney departed from Bain in 1999 to run the Salt Lake City Olympics, before two companies Bain invested in moved work from the United States to Mexico, in 2000 and 2001. On Thursday that timeline was thrown into question by a report in The Boston Globe that securities filings named Mr. Romney as the owner, president and chief executive of Bain during the period. It is unclear whether he made hands-on decisions during that time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">0:18&nbsp;&nbsp;Obama and Clinton in 2008</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the Romney campaign's second use of clips of an angry Hillary Clinton from the 2008 Democratic primary. Mrs. Clinton was criticizing then-candidate Obama for circulating fliers in Ohio that she said falsely characterized her position on trade agreements. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scorecard<BR>The two campaigns are entrenched in hand-to-hand combat over details and the significance of Mr. Romney's years at Bain, which is the source of his personal wealth and his top credential as a leader capable of improving the economy. The Obama campaign has barraged Mr. Romney on his Bain record, to the point of distorting some facts. But it is unlikely to call off the assault, which some polls show has persuaded a slice of voters to doubt Mr. Romney in swing states.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The Obama campaign finds a new vehicle to suggest that Mitt Romney ran Bain when it took conducted some controversial acts. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3:58 p.m. | Updated President Obama's campaign on Thursday seized ona new reporton Mitt Romney's truthfulness about his tenure at Bain Capital even as the Republican candidate began airing a television commercial calling the president a liar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The competing character attacks are evidence that a furious, highly personal phase in the presidential campaign is under way as both candidates seek to undercut whatever trust voters might have had in their rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's new advertisement flatly says that&nbsp;the president &quot;doesn't tell the truth,&quot; accusing Mr. Obama of making &quot;ridiculous claims&quot; about Mr. Romney's record and of citing &quot;discredited&quot; information about his time at the private equity firm he founded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is a response from&nbsp;Romney strategists to Republican critics who believe&nbsp;Mr. Romney&nbsp;needs to hit back more aggressively to attacks coming from Mr. Obama's Chicago-based campaign operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a Boston Globe article published on Thursday provided a new opportunity for the Democratic campaign to blunt any momentum the Republican might make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper reported on federal securities documents showing that Mr. Romney had served as the owner, board chairman, chief executive and president of Bain Capital for several years after he had claimed publicly to have left the firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The period in question,&nbsp;1999 to 2001, is important because of several Bain Capital investments made during that time in companies&nbsp;that moved workers overseas. Mr. Obama says that is evidence that Mr. Romney would &quot;outsource&quot; American jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a conference call with reporters,&nbsp;Obama officials accused Mr. Romney of either violating federal securities laws by falsifying information on the documents, or of misleading the American people by lying about when he left the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If in fact he now claims that he was in fact not active with the company,&quot; said Robert Bauer, Mr. Obama's top campaign lawyer, &quot;that means that these statements are false. There are very, very serious legal consequences that would follow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, said the Globe story was &quot;inaccurate&quot; and she repeated the campaign's assertion that Mr. Romney left Bain Capital in 1999 to run the Salt Lake City Olympics and never resumed operational duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As Bain Capital has said, as Governor Romney has said, and as has been confirmed by independent fact checkers multiple times, Governor Romney left Bain Capital in February of 1999 to run the Olympics and had no input on investments or management of companies after that point,&quot; Ms. Saul said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bain Capital released a statement saying that Mr. Romney was not involved in an operational role at the firm after 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney left Bain Capital in February 1999 to run the Olympics and has had absolutely no involvement with the management or investment activities of the firm or with any of its portfolio companies since the day of his departure,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Due to the sudden nature of Mr. Romney's departure, he remained the sole stockholder for a time while formal ownership was being documented and transferred to the group of partners who took over management of the firm in 1999. Accordingly, Mr. Romney was reported in various capacities on SEC filings during this period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The securities documents cited in the Globe story have been noted in the past by other news outlets. The New York Times reportedmonths ago that Mr. Romney continued to receive investment income from his Bain partnership for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far there has been no contemporaneous evidence of Mr. Romney's active participation in management decisions during the&nbsp;time in question. No one has come forward to produce notes of meetings attended by Mr. Romney. There is no indication of conference calls or partnership meetings that he participated in. In fact, &quot;The Real Romney,&quot; a biography by the Boston Globe's&nbsp;Michael Kranish and Scott Helman, spoke of turmoil at Bain Capital in the wake of Mr. Romney's departure:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His departure from Bain Capital, though, was not so neat. The partners squabbled over how the firm would operate without him. A power struggle ensued. Several partners made plans to leave. Suddenly, a company that relied on loyalty, long-term relationships, and Romney's personal courtship of investors seemed to be at risk. And such a breakup could be messy. A Bain meltdown might mean lawsuits with tens of millions of dollars at stake. The potential existed for embarrassing disclosures of how much money Romney had made on certain deals. &quot;It would have been a circus, and circuses over money are not good for politicians,&quot; one Romney associate said. Romney grew worried that the company he had worked so hard to build would be destroyed. The anxiety escalated until finally, one Sunday afternoon, Romney and one of his fellow Mormons at Bain Capital, Bob Gay, knelt on the floor together and prayed for its survival. &quot;We were facing a crucial event that threatened the very existence [of] our firm's partnership,&quot; Gay said later. In the end, the crisis abated. Romney left the firm, retaining a financial interest in it, and Bain Capital continued to thrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the lack of such evidence, Mr. Bauer said that Mr. Romney could ask Bain Capital to release notes of meetings during that period</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would stay very much tuned on that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several news organizations and independent fact checkers have raised doubts about Mr. Obama's attacks, noting that the appearance of Mr. Romney's name on securities and partnership documents does not necessarily prove his active involvement in running the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Globe story was apparently the first to note that Mr. Romney appears to have retained the title of chief executive and president during the period. The paper said disclosure documents in Massachusetts show that Mr. Romney was paid at least $100,000 for those services at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That raises questions about why Mr. Romney kept those titles and earned income for services if he was no longer actively involved in making decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephanie Cutter, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Obama, said in the conference call that Mr. Romney could clear up some of those questions by releasing multiple years of his tax returns, something Mr. Romney has so far refused to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prove it by releasing your tax returns,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The rich in America - many of whom backed Barack Obama in 2008 - have turned against the president this year, despite the fact that banks received the biggest government bailout of all. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - This week, I write about why the rich in America - many of whom backed Barack Obama in 2008 - have turned against the president this year. On the face of it, that's surprising - after all, the recovery for the 1 percent has been much more robust than it has been for everyone else, partly thanks to government intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My conclusion - spoiler alert! - is that there's one really big reason for the hostility between the wealthy and the White House: Mr. Obama is breaking with the narrative about American capitalism that has prevailed in this country at least since Ronald Reagan. That is the idea that when the rich get richer, everyone else benefits, too. Instead, the president is suggesting that American capitalism isn't delivering on its promise to the middle class - and that the rich should help fix that by paying taxes at a higher rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For me, one window into how alien this way of thinking is for many Americans came in a recent note by Brent G. Schutte, a market strategist at Harris Private Bank. Mr. Schutte compares inequality within the U.S. income distribution to inequality among players in Major League Baseball. (The gaps between top and bottom are comparable, which highlights an interesting but rarely remarked-upon fact about the winner-take-all economy: The disparity within the 1 percent, which all M.L.B. players occupy, is as great as the polarization between the 1 percent and everyone else.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Schutte's commentary is charming and original. The conclusion, though, is a straightforward lament for the days when most of us assumed the rise of multimillionaires enriched us all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope to hear less of the debate about whether or not Albert Pujols was worth the money,&quot; Mr. Schutte writes, referring to the Los Angeles Angels player, &quot;and instead more discussion on how we can create more Pujols in the future.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a heart-warming sentiment, in keeping with the heart-warming theme of unification during Mr. Obama's first campaign. But it doesn't match the reality of U.S. capitalism today, at least as the president sees it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- As President Obama and Mitt Romney rush to define the other, each man is alleging one of the great economic sins: that his rival accelerated the exodus of American jobs to foreign countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama accuses Mr. Romney of being at the helm of a firm that invested in companies that outsourced their jobs. Mr. Romney, in remarks on Tuesday, called Mr. Obama the real ''outsourcer in chief'' for sending billions of dollars in stimulus funds to foreign-based firms and companies that ''end up making their products outside the United States.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The particulars have been denied or defended by both sides, and in many cases picked over by independent fact-checkers. In response, the two candidates and their allies have all but stuck their fingers in their ears while continuing with their outsourcing attacks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no question of the potential power of the narrative, coming at a time of economic uncertainty and frustration about the tepid expansion of the labor force. But in both cases, there are deep questions about the fundamental truth of the arguments, even as each campaign continues to press forward with its charges. Mr. Obama's attacks on Mr. Romney's time at Bain Capital rely on thinly documented examples of outsourcing that took place when the Republican candidate was, at best, an absentee owner of his firm, having left day-to-day management to run the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. Romney's latest attacks on the president's stimulus spending appear to be based primarily on snippets of news reports about the activities of companies that -- upon contacting the companies themselves -- do not bear out as fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ''You're an outsourcer! No, you are!'' debate threatens to consume much of the summer as both campaigns battle their way across a dozen battleground states in a race that polls show to be tied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee on Tuesday morning unveiled a Web site alleging that under President Obama, the American Recovery Act, known as the stimulus, sent billions of dollars to companies operating overseas. In fact, several of the companies cited on the new site said the Republican characterizations of their activities were far from accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Republican committee, ABB Inc., a global energy and technology company, ''received over $16 million in stimulus funds to create green energy manufacturing jobs'' and has ''laid off workers in the U.S. and transferred work to Mexico.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That sounds like somebody taking facts and just twisting them,'' said Barry Dillon, the spokesman for ABB, based in North Carolina. Mr. Dillon said the company employs 19,000 people in the United States, and another 8,000 across Canada and Mexico. Employment is up in the United States, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's nothing wholesale that we moved from the U.S. into Mexico,'' Mr. Dillon said. In a detailed e-mail, Mr. Dillon wrote that the company has been expanding in both the United States and Mexico to meet rising demands of the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The R.N.C. also accuses Mr. Obama's administration of sending $1.3 billion in loan guarantees to a company that will manufacture solar panels in Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the SunPower Corporation, based in California, said a ''large number of the panels'' would be built at the company's facility in Milpitas, Calif., for installation at a ''solar ranch'' in California. Some will be built at its plants in Asia and Mexico, said the spokeswoman, Natalie Wymer. The federal loan guarantee, which was closer to $1.2 billion, actually went to another company, NRG Solar, which owns the solar ranch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Fisker Automotive, a manufacturer of luxury hybrid electric cars based in Anaheim, Calif., said the Republican committee's description of the company as a ''stimulus recipient'' was false. The Obama administration approved up to $529 million in loans for the company, but they were under a George W. Bush-era program intended to spur more fuel-efficient technologies, not the stimulus package. The company has taken only $193 million of the loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the company disputes Republican claims that Fisker's federal money ''went abroad for jobs that weren't created in the United States.'' The company is assembling its first electric car, called the Karma, in Finland. But Fisker and Energy Department officials say the portion of the loans being used for the Karma -- about $169 million -- has been spent on hiring and other functions solely in California and Michigan. ''Every single dollar of the loan has been used in the U.S.,'' said Roger Ormisher, Fisker's senior director of global communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney has previously attacked the loans to Fisker, which has Democratic connections: One investor, the firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, includes Obama supporters and counts as a senior partner former Vice President Al Gore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the low-interest federal loans, the company has struggled recently, and it laid off 66 workers earlier this year. Last year, the Energy Department also blocked Fisker's access to most of the loans because the company had not met certain milestones built into the loan agreement. The company said it still had 500 American employees on its payroll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Ormisher said that the company had raised more than $1 billion in private funds and that the company expected to start repaying the federal loans next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama spent Tuesday in Iowa, where he focused on his proposal to extend middle-class tax cuts for a year. But his campaign continued to make the outsourcing charge against Mr. Romney, largely through a television commercial running in nine battleground states. The ad alleges that Mr. Romney's companies ''were pioneers in outsourcing U.S. jobs to low-wage countries.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad leaves the impression that Mr. Romney directed those investments. In fact, there is compelling evidence to suggest that Mr. Romney had largely left day-to-day control of Bain Capital to his partners after 1999, when the activity at issue took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephanie Cutter, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Obama, points out that Bain is listed in Securities and Exchange Commission documents as ''wholly owned'' by Mr. Romney during that period, and that Mr. Romney is listed as a ''general partner and a member of the management committee.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central question is whether Mr. Romney's ownership of Bain -- which the campaign does not deny -- makes him responsible for the firm's actions in his absence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FactCheck.org, which examined Mr. Obama's claims, concluded that it did not. It noted that Mr. Romney stated on federal financial disclosure forms that he had ''not had any active role with any Bain Capital entity and has not been involved in the operations of any Bain Capital entity in any way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advisers to Mr. Obama say those statements are self-serving. And they note that Mr. Romney is often eager to take credit for job growth and other positive outcomes that emerged from Bain's activities long after he left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little indication that either side will give their rhetoric a rest, no matter how much outside truth-squadding calls out both campaigns. On Tuesday, Mr. Romney, campaigning in Grand Junction, Colo., insisted that he was not guilty of outsourcing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If there's an outsourcer in chief, it's the president of the United States,'' he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Giant private equity firms have discovered they gain purchasing power and save money when buying supplies for all their companies in bulk. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A single company purchased more than 50,000 Hewlett-Packard computers last year, buying in bulk to shave millions of dollars off its costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was not General Electric, Procter &amp; Gamble or another large, multinational conglomerate with the muscle to dictate prices to suppliers. Rather, the big buyer was the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private equity firms like Blackstone are emerging as a powerful new force in the marketplace. The big investors, which collectively oversee thousands of companies, are using their size and scope to pressure suppliers, set their own prices and exert their influence in a range of industries, including health care, construction and consumer goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Blackstone was part of a group of companies that collectively bought 16 million reams of copy paper, 35 million FedEx shipments and 900,000 days' worth of rental cars from National and Avis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have incredible leverage,&quot; said James A. Quella, Blackstone's North American head of portfolio operations. &quot;The more volume we have, the lower our prices go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, private equity firms like Blackstone have been viewed as financial alchemists who buy undervalued companies, rejigger their balance sheets and sell them for quick gain. In good times, the strategy worked. Buyout specialists could turn a tidy profit in a matter of months, without getting deeply involved in the businesses they owned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence the &quot;barbarians at the gate&quot; stereotype, which has arisen again in recent months as the presidential election has brought the private equity debate into sharp focus. Critics of the industry have faulted Mitt Romney, the presumed Republican candidate, for his years of running Bain Capital, a large buyout firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry players have been cast as job destroyers more concerned with making money for investors than improving the companies they own. One particularly critical ad for the Obama campaign featured a company, GST Steel, that went out of business years after it was taken over by Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the financial crisis, the decline of stocks markets and the sputtering recovery, private equity has been adapting its ways. While profit remains central and layoffs can still be part of the private equity equation, buyout firms are now stuck holding on to companies longer than expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the firms cannot operate at arm's length anymore and instead have had to roll up their sleeves and become full-fledged operators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The private equity titans have huge economic influence and sway, largely because of the size of their portfolios. Blackstone owns all or part of 74 companies that employ 700,000 people and generate $117 billion in annual revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken collectively, Blackstone's businesses would rank as the 13th largest company by revenue, ahead of JPMorgan Chase, I.B.M. and Procter &amp; Gamble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, another megafirm, would be No. 5 on that list with its 74 portfolio companies and $210 billion in aggregate revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Carlyle Group has investments in 200 portfolio companies, including Dunkin' Brands and Hertz, that collectively employ around 675,000 people - more than General Motors and General Electric combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historically, private equity firms were about financial engineering,&quot; said Jason Busch, managing director at Spend Matters, a research firm that focuses on the procurement processes of big corporations. &quot;That's the fairy tale story from 25 or 30 years ago. Within the last decade, there's been more operational work to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blackstone and others are taking the cues from the likes of General Electric. Decades ago, G.E. started buying in bulk for its various businesses units, including aerospace, energy, consumer and finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the disparate industries spread across dozens of countries, G.E. decided to make buying decisions at the corporate level, as a way to save money and bolster profits. Today, most large multinational companies adhere to a similar strategy for their supply chain, buying computers, office supplies and all types of products at a discount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, private equity firms are too. Both Blackstone and K.K.R. belong to a group purchasing program called CoreTrust, which has roughly 200 member companies including TPG Capital, Bain Capital, and other private equity firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program, which began in 2006, helps companies save 10 to 50 percent on common items, and even lets them stay enrolled after they are sold or taken public by their private equity owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's just common sense,&quot; said Todd Cooper, head of procurement for K.K.R., which uses CoreTrust for some bulk purchases. &quot;Every company, whether I'm a manufacturer or a retailer, uses FedEx. Everybody needs laptops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those savings can add up. Blackstone says it has saved $600 million since 2006 through CoreTrust, direct supplier relationships and an equity health care group, which applies the same group purchasing principles to employee health insurance plans. K.K.R. pegs its total savings at north of $700 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a phenomenal benefit,&quot; said Chris Karkenny, the chief financial officer of Apria, a health care company that was acquired by Blackstone in 2008 and has since used CoreTrust to buy telecommunications equipment, office supplies and other goods. &quot;We do just over $2 billion in revenue, but we're getting rates that companies with $100 billion in revenue would get.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2005, Mr. Quella of Blackstone recruited Gregory Beutler, a former G.E. executive, to help Blackstone drive down prices in its biggest spending categories. The two set a goal of saving $100 million a year through bulk-buying. They immediately began reaching out to the company's suppliers, telling them that they were to treat Blackstone's myriad businesses like one giant conglomerate, and set their prices accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We went to U.P.S. and FedEx,&quot; Mr. Quella said. &quot;We said, 'Guys, we just did an analysis: our smallest company is paying $9.95 for overnight. Our largest company is paying $6.95 for overnight. You guys charge whatever you get away with. We want one price, and we want that price to be the price you give your biggest customer.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hardball tactic worked. &quot;We negotiate them to the wall,&quot; Mr. Beutler said of Blackstone's suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another cost-cutting tactic is the reverse e-auction. In the eBay-style process, suppliers are given a set period of time, typically an hour, to bid against one another for a large contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, when Emdeon, a medical data provider owned by Blackstone, wanted to renegotiate a contract for a type of large, 112-pound paper rolls it uses to print medical claim statements and customer bills, Mr. Beutler organized a one-hour e-auction involving four paper makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Quella and Mr. Beutler watched eagerly from their desks as the bids began at $47.43 a roll, then fell as companies began lowering their prices. When the auction ended, a late bid of $45.87 a roll had won out. The savings were small by group purchasing standards, only about 3 percent of a contract that averages around $3.5 million annually. But at the scale of private equity, every dollar counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ten percent of a big number is a big number,&quot; Mr. Quella explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While e-auctions and other aggressive negotiating tactics save money for private equity firms, they often put suppliers in a bind: should they lose out on a large contract, or win it and make the narrowest of profit margins?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It almost is a necessary evil,&quot; said Anthony C. Chukumba, an analyst for BB&amp;T Capital Markets. &quot;You want the business. But if you bid so low and then win a contract, then you have something that is only marginally profitable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some large private equity firms choose not to participate in programs like CoreTrust, typically because they believe the group purchasing process strains relationships with suppliers, and requires them to micromanage companies in exchange for relatively small savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private equity-owned companies, too, have raised objections to group purchasing programs, which often require them to change suppliers from the ones they have used for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's difficult to break companies out of their mindsets,&quot; said Justin Hillenbrand, a partner at Monomoy Capital Partners, a midmarket private equity firm that uses a group purchasing program for its portfolio companies. &quot;Maybe they've been using U.P.S. forever, and because of that U.P.S. gives them favors; maybe it delivers things at odd hours. Guess what? If my purchasing program can get FedEx for 25 percent cheaper, they're going to switch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one meeting, Mr. Quella of Blackstone said, the chief executive of a portfolio company expressed his frustration that the firm's group purchasing plan would force him to switch the brand of toilet paper his company used in its bathrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, group purchasing advocates defend their work as a necessary part of private equity's fat-trimming process. Blackstone and K.K.R., rival firms in almost every sense, are now teaming up to introduce CoreTrust to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As group purchasing programs grow, they will have to tread lightly, finding a balance in getting the prices they want and not angering the companies they own, or their suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's one thing to fool with the balance sheet of a company - it's another to change its operations,&quot; said Mr. Busch of Spend Matters. &quot;It's absolutely about rolling up your sleeves, but it's about having soft hands as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Videos attacking the presidential candidates focus on outsourcing and Mitt Romney's wealth. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential campaigns are nothing if not persistent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee pressed ahead Wednesday morning with its outsourcing attack on President Obama with a Web video that claims government stimulus money created jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama promised jobs that can't be outsourced,&quot; the video says. &quot;Most of the jobs are going overseas, hurting American workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video uses news reports to back its charges. One ABC News report says that &quot;nearly eight out of every 10 stimulus dollar have gone to foreign companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign, meanwhile, continued to keep the pressure on Mitt Romney to release more information about his personal fortune, and especially about his Swiss bank accounts and other investments in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a video released Wednesday, the campaign shows Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, stating flatly at a Congressional hearing that the only reason to have such accounts would be to dodge taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only real difference that I hear between investing in Cayman Islands or investing in the United States, or the only way that the Cayman Island investments are superior, is the possibility of avoiding U.S. tax,&quot; the senator says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds, &quot;I don't think that that is something the American public would agree with or appreciate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video also shows a clip of Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, during his 2008 presidential campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm the guy that doesn't have some offshore mailbox, bank account in the Caymans hiding my money,&quot; Mr. Huckabee says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns are eager to push their messages, and Web videos like the ones they released on Wednesday do so with very little cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be interesting to see whether Mr. Romney's campaign starts running costly television commercials on the outsourcing question -- something that Mr. Obama has already done against his Republican rival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And look out for Mr. Obama's video to become a full-blown television ad in a swing state near you. If so, it could help push the issue of Mr. Romney's personal wealth into an even bigger issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, the average federal tax rate on incomes over $1 million would fall from 31.4 percent to 23.3 percent under the Romney plan, a roughly one-quarter decline. (Mr. Williams emphasized that the Romney campaign has also promised to broaden the tax base but has failed to enumerate how it would do this, making it impossible to fully analyze their plan.) As for the Obama plan, he said that middle-class taxes would not change while wealthier taxpayers would pay more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">0:12&nbsp;&nbsp;Romney: Tax Hike for 18 Million Working Families</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assuming the extension of the Bush tax cuts and Alternative Minimum Tax relief, those taxpayers who would see their I.R.S. bills rise under the Romney plan (almost 11 percent of all filers) would suffer an average increase of $885, according to the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The overwhelming number of people in this category make less than $50,000, and they would see tax increases under the Romney plan because of the expiration of three provisions passed in 2009, including the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit. The ad does not mention that about 118 million filers would get a tax cut. That includes nearly everyone making $100,000 or more, as well as about 77 percent of those making $30,000 to $40,000, for example, and 94 percent of those making $50,000 to $75,000.      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">0:17&nbsp;&nbsp;Obama: Make Wealthy Pay More</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's newly proposed plan calls for a one-year extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for people making less than $250,000. According to the administration, a one-year extension for people making under $250,000 would cost the government $150 billion in revenue. In a point of comparison, economists estimate that letting the cuts expire for people above that threshold would generate $850 billion over 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scorecard<BR>Mr. Romney is basing much of his campaign on the idea he is an accomplished and skilled businessman who could deal effectively with the nation's economic problems. The ad tries to undermine this claim by trying to paint Mr. Romney as an ally of the wealthy and corporations, including those that have sent American jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Brooks and Collins on why people are bored by Obama vs. Romney - and why we shouldn't be. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Brooks: Gail, for the past few weeks, I've been collecting string for a column on why young people should care a lot more about politics. And when I say collecting string I mean piling up books and articles on the subject without ever working up the willpower to actually read them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail Collins: Oh yes, collecting string. It is second only to the myth of &quot;the backup column.&quot; The column that you will keep in storage just in case whatever you're doing doesn't work out. Which in the real world is devoured as fast as a warm chocolate-chip cookie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: Not a lot of people are following politics closely this year. Four years ago, pollsters asked Americans if they found the presidential race interesting. A clear plurality said yes. This year, a clear plurality says no. Somehow they find a race between two androids less than scintillating.<BR>Gail: Well, duh. You have the dramatic change-guy who didn't seem to change anything - although I personally would argue that health care alone was huge. And on the other side, the incredibly boring businessman who has offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands to avoid the taxes most of the rest of the country has to pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David:&nbsp;&nbsp; We may be entering an era in which politics is less central.&nbsp; A lot has happened recently - jobs numbers, a health care law upheld, new immigration policies, zillions of dollars in ad spending. And the polls have hardly moved. Obama had a tiny lead four months ago and he has a tiny lead now. Nobody's mind is being changed because nobody who is persuadable is paying attention. It's apathy city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: David, don't feel bad. I'm happy to tell you it's the Republicans' fault. The normal rule of democracy is that if things are lousy, you throw out the incumbents. But right now the opposition is controlled by people who are totally insane and good at nothing but shutting things down. I would argue that the president, with a Congress composed mainly of Democrats and traditional Republicans, could take care of a lot of our problems. But if people simply want a change, all they've got is the Forces of Loony Doom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: Gail, did you accidentally leave the TV on and absorb a night's worth of MSNBC subliminally in your sleep? Your partisan ya-yas are flowing. By the way, if you did, have you seen the world's most embarrassing promo spots, the ones directed by Spike Lee in which the hosts are put in front of some big infrastructure project or the White House and forced to give a pious speech as if they are high school kids running to be Robert Moses? Why can't MSNBC hosts unionize and put an end to this humiliation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, the topic at hand is apathy. Granted, I studiously ignore stories about fund-raising numbers. I have never seen compelling evidence that fund-raising levels powerfully influenced a presidential race. Whether Romney outraises Obama or vice versa is totally unimportant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: Although, the billionaires, good grief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David:&nbsp; But I still follow the other political news closely and I still think politics is the most complicated and consequential of human activities, and very much worth obsessing about. I often mention to goo-goo types that Haiti has thousands of N.G.O.'s, which are presumably doing good work (well, at least half of them). But if the politicians don't get governance right, there's only so much anyone else can do. The place will still be a wreck. Politics matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: No argument here. It's the Tea Party forces on the Republican side who don't actually believe in politics. They have a my-way-or-the-highway mentality that won't go away until they get the message that most Americans don't want to shut down large parts of the government, privatize entitlements, privatize education, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: I think you're a bit over the top here. If there is anybody who wants to eliminate entitlements, I haven't met that person. Wanting to reform the schools with charters is not exactly handing them over to Enron. Even Paul Ryan wants government to consume about 19 percent of G.D.P., which is nearly twice as big as it was under F.D.R.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big argument is over the shape of government and its size, within limits. And I continue to believe that electoral politics presents the sternest character test, especially these days. The job of being a senator or even president just stinks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: On that last point, I totally agree. Very few people appreciate how hard it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: Imagine all the fund-raising. Imagine all the travel. Imagine all the criticism. These people do it because they are emotional freaks (O.K., I grant that) but also because they want to do good for the country. To run for office, you have to play close attention to what other people want. You have to balance the demands of marketing with the cry of conscience. You get mercilessly punished for each bad decision or unfortunate word, not to mention everything good that you do. We think ill of our politicians not because they are so rotten, but because the tasks are so hard. How can this drama not be interesting?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: I have always loved politics. I have always loved politicians. They are generally truly humble people, even though they're egomaniacs. They understand how much they're under the thumb of average folks back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: I was going through the decades of the 20th century to try to see which of them were primarily political decades. That is to say, was the most important thing that happened that decade political or not? My results follow:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1900s - Industrialization. Not Political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1910s - World War I. Political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1920s - Consumer culture and beginning of mass prosperity. Not Political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1930s - The New Deal. Political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1940s - World War II. Political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1950s - Suburbanization. Not Political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1960s - New Frontier, Civil Rights, Vietnam. Political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1970s - Feminism. Not Political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1980s - Reagan Revolution. Capitalist Revival. Semi-Political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1990s - Silicon Valley. Not Political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2000s - 9/11, Afghanistan and Iraq. Political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: Hmmm. Just coming from my own special thing, I would argue that feminism was political. But go on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: Yeah, I know, the personal is political and all that. But one has to draw lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In at least half the decades, politics was the most important thing that happened, though to be fair in the happier decades politics took a back seat. I think this vindicates my feeling that anybody who is not paying close attention is not paying attention to the one of the main arenas of life in their time. You can try to ignore politics, but it won't ignore you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: Of course I agree with you.&nbsp; But I can see how this particular campaign is turning a lot of people off. And now that I think of it, I might have been too quick in giving up on the issue of the &quot;super PACs&quot; and their endless money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Folks in the true-blue or really-red states feel as if their votes don't matter, and they're sort of right - it's as if they've already been counted. And people in the swing states are under such a barrage of attack ads from both sides, they're numb with disdain for everybody involved.&nbsp; I have family visiting from Ohio right now, and they're like refugees from a TV-ad tsunami. And it's only July! There's got to be a better way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Game On! blogger Reid Cherner has been traded, but it was never a multiteam deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dwight Howard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Renaissance didn't last as long as the Orlando Magic's quest to trade their superstar center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we couldn't laugh about this, we'd be brought to tears by  boredom or rage depending on what side you're on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can only hope to wake up and find all 30 teams involved in a  move so complicated that David Stern voids the deal until his special arbitrator Stan Van Gundy  can make a ruling. That forces Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert to take out an ad lashing out at the selfishness of his colleagues and guaranteeing his team wins a title before the other 29 franchises. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is &quot;The Decision&quot; I could live with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adrian Peterson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minnesota Vikings superstar had me at Winston Churchill. Anytime you can quote somebody who is undefeated in World Wars, you deserve the benefit of the doubt when it comes to a bar altercation. And you have to like him hiring Roger Clemens' attorney, Rusty Hardin, to defend him on a misdemeanor. Nothing like a sledgehammer to rid yourself of a pesky gnat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Peterson and Hardin, who calls his client the &quot;victim,&quot; try to take it in from the 1, they  can't reuse &quot;a lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.&quot; Peterson used that in his post-bar comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they can remain Churchillian by saying, &quot;It is a fine thing to be honest, but it is also very important to be right,&quot; or &quot;Criticism may not be agreeable, but it is necessary. It fulfills the same function as pain in the human body. It calls attention to an unhealthy state of things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He should probably save the &quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot; speech for  a playoff game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reggie Jackson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. October is no longer the flavor of the month in the New York Yankees clubhouse after his comments about Alex Rodriguez and performance-enhancing drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Joe Torre, not exactly immune to the cold shoulder of New York and the calming influence for the Yankees for so many years, said in a news conference Tuesday, &quot;Reggie is still a Yankee. They just asked him to step aside a while.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson told USA TODAY Sports' Bob Nightengale on Tuesday: &quot;I'm not banned, and I don't want to stay away too long. I don't want it to look like I'm hiding. I just want this thing to go away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson, who initially said he had been banned by the team, now says it's just a good old-fashioned scolding. Jackson and the rest of the world have a different definition of the word &quot;ban.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penn State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rightly or wrongly, Penn Staters could be criticized for things from lack of institutional control to elevating an incredibly decent man to sainthood just for winning national titles. But you can't question their loyalty. After a sainted coach's firing and a  sex scandal involving a former employee, donations are up in Happy Valley to the tune of a second-highest-ever nearly $209 million total. That is from nearly 191,000 contributors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It might benefit the country if President Obama and Gov. Romney put more Nittany Lions and fewer Ivy Leaguers on their staffs when they debate the economy. <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the battle for political cash, President Obama is finding himself in an unaccustomed place during the final months of the 2012 campaign: he is losing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney and the Republican National Committee easily outraised the formidable Obama money machine for the second month in a row. A nonstop schedule of high-dollar events around the country brought in $106 million during June to Mr. Obama's $71 million, giving him and his party four times the cash on hand that it had just three months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's fund-raising deficit in part reflects how steeply the terrain has shifted since 2008, when many Republican donors embraced the candidate and his campaign raised millions of dollars from Wall Street and other traditionally right-leaning industries. Now those donors are swinging hard back to the Republican Party -- and to Mr. Romney, whose promise to curtail regulation and cut taxes has helped draw a torrent of five-figure checks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a worrisome development for the Obama campaign, Mr. Romney, who until now has been heavily dependent on donors giving the maximum federal contribution, also showed success in June drawing small donors, a traditional strength of the Obama campaign. Reflecting the intensifying general election matchup with Mr. Obama and conservative anger over the recent Supreme Court decision upholding the president's signature health care law, Mr. Romney raised about a third of his total in checks of under $250, officials said on Monday. Mr. Romney and the R.N.C. now have about $160 million in cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This month's fund-raising is a statement from voters that they want a change of direction in Washington,'' Spencer Zwick, Mr. Romney's finance chief, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's surge puts him on track to raise the $800 million his campaign and the Republican National Committee hope to bring in by Election Day, leaving the real possibility that Mr. Obama could be outspent despite the advantages of incumbency. And with political reality reasserting itself on Mr. Obama, he is being forced to rely more heavily on traditional Democratic constituencies, like Hollywood, labor unions and gay donors, as well as his own millions of small donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's the perfect storm for Republicans,'' said R. Donahue Peebles, a New York businessman who has raised more than $100,000 for Mr. Obama. ''Republicans and independents who supported the president financially thought they would see a change in how Washington worked. What they see now, and it's not necessarily the president's fault, is a lot of partisanship in Washington and a struggling economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, who reported about $109 million in cash in the bank at the end of May, has been significantly outspending Mr. Romney on advertising in swing states. But Mr. Romney's fund-raising successes are being matched by Republican-leaning outside groups, who are barraging the airwaves with anti-Obama advertisements that the president's campaign has been forced to spend its own money to match. On Monday, the biggest of the ''super PACs,'' American Crossroads, announced a $40 million, nine-state fall ad campaign against Mr. Obama, coming on top of a $25 million spree by an affiliate that will run through Labor Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama easily outraised Mr. Romney through much of the last year, as Mr. Romney fought for the Republican nomination and Mr. Obama exploited his incumbency to raise large checks in conjunction with the Democratic National Committee. And newly minted nominees typically take in huge influxes of cash as major donors come off the sidelines at the end of a nominating fight, as John Kerry did during the early months of the 2004 general election campaign against George W. Bush. Come November, the final tally between the two candidates could be close to a draw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet money flooding into Mr. Romney's campaign suggests that even Mr. Obama -- the most prodigious fund-raiser to date in political history -- can be beaten. And Democratic-aligned outside groups, including those investing heavily in races for the House and the Senate, are far behind their Republican counterparts in raising and spending money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All told, Republican candidates, party committees and outside groups have spent $269 million on broadcast advertising, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, compared with $133 million for the Democratic side. Those totals do not included tens of millions of dollars that Mr. Obama invested early in the cycle on data mining, technology and campaign infrastructure, efforts Mr. Romney is now seeking to match on the fly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is being outraised despite a more intense fund-raising schedule than any of his predecessors: He was scheduled to hold two events on Monday in Washington, bringing the total to 174 fund-raisers since formally beginning his re-election campaign last year, according to CBS News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama sought to rally supporters on Monday with a blunt e-mail from Ann Marie Habershaw, the campaign's chief operating officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We could lose if this continues,'' Ms. Habershaw warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several top Obama donors said privately that Mr. Obama's attacks on Mr. Romney's private equity career, the president's handling of White House relations with business leaders and his criticisms of tax rates for the wealthy had made it harder for some of his allies to raise money on Mr. Obama's behalf from the financial sector and other industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He will not have the same level of support from the business community as last time -- either in endorsements, money or support,'' said one Obama backer who declined to be identified because of his relationship with the campaign. ''That's clear.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Peebles, the Obama fund-raiser, echoed objections among some other Democrats, many with ties to the financial industry, over what he said were unreasonable attacks on the wealthy by the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I just got back from Rhode Island on my boat,'' Mr. Peebles said, referring to criticism of Mr. Romney's much-photographed vacation boating last week on New Hampshire's Lake Winnipesaukee. ''I can hold 12 people on my boat. I don't feel that I'm out of touch with Americans or that I am a bad person. I find it offensive, and I'm a supporter.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has a Harvard law degree. Former President George W. Bush has a Harvard M.B.A. Will the next president have both?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most exclusive clubs in academe is a Harvard University dual-degree program allowing graduate students to attend its law and business schools simultaneously, cramming five years of education into four. On average, about 12 people per year have completed the program -- the overachievers of the overachievers -- including a striking number of big names in finance, industry, law and government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program is so small that it has drawn little attention outside rarefied circles, but that may change as its most famous graduate, Mitt Romney, campaigns for the White House, subjecting every phase of his life to scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Harvard started its so-called J.D.-M.B.A. program in 1969, there were just a handful like it. Others have cropped up since, but Harvard's has what may be the most successful alumni roster, particularly in finance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Mr. Romney, founder of Bain Capital, the roughly 500 graduates include Bruce Wasserstein, who led the investment bank Lazard until he died in 2009; leaders of multibillion-dollar hedge fund and private equity firms like Canyon Capital Advisors, Silver Lake Partners and Crestview Partners; high-ranking executives at banks like Citigroup and Credit Suisse; C. James Koch, founder of the Boston Beer Company; and Theodore V. Wells Jr., one of the nation's top trial lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young Mr. Romney wanted to go to business school, while his father, George W. Romney, a cabinet secretary and former Michigan governor, urged him to go to law school. So the younger Mr. Romney did both, studying at Harvard from 1971 to 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What was special about these people was that they had bandwidth,'' said Malcolm S. Salter, an emeritus business professor who helped create the program. ''They had to be driven, hard-working and organized to a degree that was unusual even for Harvard business or law grad students.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guhan Subramanian, who graduated from the program in 1998 and now is its faculty chairman, said the students could be viewed as ''resume builders who haven't figured out what to do with their lives and are just checking off all the boxes.'' But he said they are genuinely interested in mastering both fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students must be admitted separately to the business and law schools before applying for the program. That is a feat in itself, because the two student bodies are quite different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law school takes younger students, often straight out of college, putting more emphasis on academic credentials, while the business school usually wants work and leadership experience. Business students are often described as being more gregarious and at ease with numbers, law students as more intellectual and facile with words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there are politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I was among the most conservative people at the law school and one of the most liberal people at the business school,'' said Peter Halasz, a partner at the law firm Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel, who completed the program in the early 1980s. ''Studying at both exposes you to many different kinds of people and various sides of an argument.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political gap was wider in Mr. Romney's era, scarred by Vietnam and Watergate, when law students wore T-shirts and business students wore ties to class. ''The law school was very swept up in the politics of the time, but the business school pretty much ignored them,'' said Detlev Vagts, a law professor who ran the program for more than 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles E. Haldeman Jr., former head of Putnam Investments and Freddie Mac, was a year ahead of Mr. Romney in the program. ''Back then, people were trying to save the world,'' Mr. Haldeman said. ''Because I was interested in business, and doing well economically mattered to me, and I didn't think the country was controlled by evil people, the law school students did think of me as a little different.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both schools were overwhelmingly male in those days. And far more graduates have gone into business than law; many, like Mr. Wasserstein, switch to business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawrence Golub, chief executive of the Golub Capital investment firm, said that the vast majority of graduates end up in business rather than law because of the earnings potential and the quality of life. ''One learns that the life of associate at a big corporate law firm is demanding, unpleasant and not as lucrative as what you can do on the business side,'' said Mr. Golub, who graduated from the program in 1984 and founded its alumni society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many graduates, Mr. Golub said, the toughest lesson after a lifetime of uninterrupted success is ''that failing won't kill you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1970s, many graduates went into management consulting, as Mr. Romney did, but for most of the program's history, finance has dominated, which some people connected to the program find mildly disappointing. Professor Salter said he had hoped the program would produce more public servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But former students and professors say it makes sense that a group of overachievers would be drawn to financial markets, a hypercompetitive field with the promise of immense riches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, a program graduate, said, ''I wanted to be a business or commercial lawyer and thought I could meet prospective clients at H.B.S.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Ogunlesi, whose law classmates included Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., practiced law only briefly. He became head of investment banking at Credit Suisse, then chairman of Global Infrastructure Partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When you're negotiating as a banker, it helps to throw in a few choice legal terms to suggest that you could help them think through how the deal can get done from a legal point of view,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students start by taking the first year of one program, and then the first year of the other. In their third and fourth years, they take courses from both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who start with the first year of law school -- often regarded as the hardest -- as Mr. Romney did are more likely to complete both degrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in another sense, Mr. Romney is atypical. He is one of only two alumni to have a high-profile career in politics, along with Christopher Cox, a former congressman and Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. (In a historical quirk, Jack Ryan, Mr. Obama's Republican opponent in the 2004 Senate race in Illinois, has a Harvard J.D.-M.B.A. He dropped out of the race amid allegations that he had pressured his former wife to go to sex clubs.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As long as politics remains a relatively low-paying, fickle career, graduates do not expect to see many students taking the political path. All the more reason that other dual-degree graduates, whether or not they support Mr. Romney, admit to being intrigued by the prospect that one of theirs might become president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Who knows,'' Mr. Golub said, ''maybe we'll be holding our next reunion at the White House.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction: July 17, 2012, Tuesday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on July 10 about Harvard University's dual graduate degree program in law and business misstated the status of women when the program began in 1969. The first group of students to enter the program included a woman, Patricia Gimbel Lewis, who completed both degrees in 1971; it was not ''several years'' before the program had its first female student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction: July 20, 2012, Friday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on July 10 with an article about Harvard University's dual graduate degree program in law and business misstated the year that a photograph of Mitt and Ann Romney appeared in a yearbook at Harvard. It was in 1973, not in 1974.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Results from three recent national surveys show a country that is closely divided between the presidential candidates but not very enthusiastic about voting this fall. Respondents also said that politics were behind the recent action by the Republican-led House to hold the attorney general in contempt, and that the Obama administration should answer all questions about the gun-trafficking case known as Operation Fast and Furious. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new Washington Post/ABC News poll showed Barack Obama and Mitt Romney tied, each with 47 percent of support among registered voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most voters also said they were committed to their choices, with just 8 percent of Romney supporters saying there was a good chance they could change their minds, and just 4 percent of Obama supporters saying so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the even support for the candidates, nearly 6 in 10 Americans said that Mr. Obama would emerge the victor this fall, compared with about a third who said Mr. Romney would win. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll showed stronger enthusiasm among Mr. Obama's supporters, with more than half saying they were very enthusiastic, compared with fewer than 4 in 10 of Mr. Romney's supporters. Most of Mr. Romney's supporters said their vote was against President Obama, rather than for Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans gave the president less than stellar ratings on the economy, immigration, and health care, with a majority saying they disapproved of his handling of each issue. Voters divided nearly evenly over would will do better on their most important issue, the economy: 48 percent said Mr. Romney would do a better job, while 45 percent favored Mr. Obama. However, Mr. Romney scored lower among voters on qualities like understanding Americans' economic problems, likability and standing up for what he believes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gallup examined swing state voters in its recent tracking survey, looking at the responses of 1,200 respondents in 12 states that they deemed as highly contested in this year's election. And while voters in these swing states were more likely to be exposed to television ads from the campaigns, their enthusiasm for voting in the election was not very different from .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among swing state voters, 25 percent said they were extremely enthusiastic about voting in the 2012 election, compared with 22 percent nationwide. Over all, nearly a third of voters said they were not enthusiastic about voting this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CNN/ORCpoll conducted in the days after the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to hold Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt found that just over half of Americans approved of the action taken by the House of Representatives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, about 6 in 10 Americans said the Republican investigation of Operation Fast and Furious was mostly to gain political advantage, while about a third said it was due to real ethical concerns. And nearly 7 in 10 Americans said President Obama and his aides should answer all questions related to the investigation - only 27 percent said they should continue to invoke executive privilege. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone July 5 to 8 among 1,003 adults, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points for the full sample and registered voters. The CNN/ORC poll was conducted by telephone June 28 to July 1 among 1,517 adults, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Gallup's swing states survey was based on telephone interviews conducted June 22 to 29 on the Gallup Daily tracking survey, of 1,200 registered voters living in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.</SPAN></P>

Holder Jr., in a speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, vowed that the Justice Department would &quot;remain aggressive&quot; in challenging new restrictions on voter access to the ballot. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5:10 p.m. | Updated Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.&nbsp;on Tuesday vowed that the Justice Department would &quot;remain aggressive&quot; in challenging new restrictions on voter access to the ballot. His remarks came in a speech&nbsp;before the annual convention of the&nbsp;National Association for the Advancement of Colored People&nbsp;in Houston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In our efforts to protect voting rights and to prevent voting fraud, we will be vigilant and strong,&quot; Mr. Holder said. &quot;But let me be clear: we will not allow political pretexts to disenfranchise American citizens of their most precious right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Holder's appearance coincided with a trial in Washington this week over whether a photo ID voting requirement enacted by Texas violates the Voting Rights Act. The Justice Department refused to allow the law to take effect, saying that the state had failed to prove that the law would not disproportionately suppress legitimate minority voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas has asked a court to allow it to enforce the law. Mr. Holder said that he could not predict the outcome of the trial, but sharply criticized a wave of ballot restrictions, which have been pushed largely by Republican state officials. He noted that the Texas law allowed concealed handgun permits to be used, but not student identification cards, and said that nationally &quot;only 8 percent of white voting age citizens, while 25 percent of African-American voting age citizens,&quot; lack a government-issued photo identification card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The arc of American history has always moved toward expanding the electorate,&quot; he said. &quot;It is what has made this nation exceptional. We will simply not allow this era to be the beginning of the reversal of that historic progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department's vigorous enforcement of civil rights laws under Mr. Holder has been a hallmark of his tenure, drawing praise from liberals and helping to make him an object of sharp criticism from conservatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In speaking before the N.A.A.C.P., Mr. Holder, the nation's first black attorney general, was ensured a far more supportive audience than he has frequently encountered before the Republican-led House of Representatives, which voted last month to cite him for contempt of Congress in a dispute over access to internal Justice Department documents related to the gun-trafficking investigation called Operation Fast and Furious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Holder also lauded Supreme Court decisions last month that upheld the Obama administration's health care law and struck down much of an Arizona statute cracking down on illegal immigrants, calling them both &quot;monumental rulings&quot; in which the court &quot;broadly affirmed the government's position as argued by the Justice Department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he also said the Justice Department would keep a sharp eye on how Arizona implemented an important provision of the immigration law that the court did not strike down, which requires police to check the immigration status of people they stop or arrest if they suspect them of being in the country illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court deferred judgment on that provision because the state has not yet started enforcing it, while leaving open the possibility of later &quot;constitutional challenges to the law as it is interpreted and applied after it goes into effect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No American should ever live under a cloud of suspicion just because of what they look like,&quot; Mr. Holder said. &quot;Going forward, we must ensure that Arizona law enforcement officials do not enforce this law in a manner that undermines the civil rights of Americans. In this work, I can assure you that the Department of Justice will continue to be vigilant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UPDATE: Mr. Holder went further in an ad-lib. After noting that many legitimate voters without a photo ID &quot;would have to travel great distances to get them and some would struggle to pay for those documents necessary to get them,&quot; he added,  &quot;We call those poll taxes.&quot; The comment about &quot;poll taxes,&quot; a tactic used by Southern states during the Jim Crow era to keep African-Americans from voting, was not part of his prepared remarks circulated among reporters. (Hat tip: Talking Points Memo.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his remarks, the convention passed a resolution in support of Mr. Holder and his work on civil rights, saying that the contempt citation against him was a &quot;travesty of justice&quot; and calling upon its members to contact Congress &quot;to express their outrage at the treatment of the first African-American and one of the best attorney generals in American history.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presumptive Republican nominee for president, Mitt Romney, is scheduled to address the convention on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">An excerpt from &quot;The Gospel According to The Fix: An Insider's Guide to a Less Than Holy World of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Politics,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">being published Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You've probably never heard of Carl Forti. He has never been on television and he's rarely quoted in the newspaper. But Forti knows the world of super PACs better than anyone in the Republican Party - and that knowledge makes him one of the most important strategists in the GOP heading into the fall election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before you get to know Forti, you need to get to know super PACs. Outside money has been spent on campaigns for as long as there have been campaigns. Wealthy individuals interested in politics have long sought ways around the relatively stringent federal campaign finance regulations - you can donate only $2,500 or so to a candidate - in hopes of exerting more influence on the electoral process. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early part of the 2000 campaign, the spending vehicle of choice was known as a 527, which referred to the section of the tax code that governed its operations. The groups could raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals, but they had to disclose the names and donation amounts of everyone who gave to them. The 527s also couldn't directly advocate for the election or defeat of a candidate. What does that mean in real life? A 527 could run an ad highlighting John Kerry's flip-flops on the war in Iraq. It couldn't explicitly say that those flip-flops were a reason not to vote for him. It's a subtle difference but an important one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of that changed in 2010 with the much-ballyhooed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Citizens United</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ruling by the Supreme Court. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Citizens United</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did lots of things to change campaign finance law in the country, but the most significant was that it got rid of the ban on outside groups expressly advocating for the election or defeat of a candidate. From that ruling came super PACs, political committees that are free to accept unlimited donations and directly advocate for or against a candidate. (Super PACs, like 527s, do have to disclose their donors and the amount of each contribution.) If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Citizens United</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the parent, the super PAC was the golden child. And Forti was the one who first recognized that the child was a political prodigy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I met Forti more than a decade ago, I would not have bet that he would become the man who would rock the political world. He was a big guy - a prototypical power forward in pickup hoops - who, in meetings, would almost always be sitting quietly in the corner with a smirk on his face. (If you looked up &quot;palooka&quot; in the dictionary, you got Forti.) In those days - circa 2000 - Forti was working as the communications director at the National Republican Congressional Committee, a job of considerable import in Washington. The NRCC is responsible for electing Republican candidates to the House - but with virtually no profile outside of Washington. (Little did I know what a talent incubator the NRCC was in those days; the political director, Terry Nelson, went on to manage Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forti stayed with the NRCC for four elections. By the 2006 elections, he was not just managing the communications operation but was also running a vast independent expenditure program - under another quirk of campaign finance law, the party committees could run television ads in hopes of influencing the outcomes - that eventually spent more than $80 million. (All of that spending did Forti - and the GOP - little good in the 2006 election; Democrats won back the House after 12 years in the wilderness of the minority.) He left that gig to move to Boston to serve as the political director of Mitt Romney's 2008 presidential campaign. &quot;Why would you want to talk to me?&quot; Forti remembers asking the Romney team, noting that all of his experience was on the communications side, not the political side. The response? &quot;You get [expletive] done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Romney went kaput in the presidential race, Forti moved back to Virginia and started a consulting business known as the Black Rock Group. (The firm was named after Black Rock, N.Y. - a neighbor to Forti's native Buffalo.) And that's when things started happening for Forti in the world of super PACs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          American Crossroads          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all began with American Crossroads, a super PAC organized around the 2010 election and designed to help Republicans win House and Senate seats. George W. Bush administration political svengali Karl Rove and longtime Republican operative Steve Law were the two other foundational pillars of Crossroads. (They raised the money, he spent it, Forti explained.) American Crossroads grew into a fundraising behemoth and a Democratic nightmare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the 2010 election, Crossroads raised and spent $71 million on House and Senate races, a massive sum that helped tip control of the lower chamber to Republicans and aided the party's six-seat pickup in the Senate. And Crossroads didn't let up, raising $51 million in 2011 and doubling - yes, doubling - its initial $100 million fundraising goal for 2012 to $200 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as Crossroads was taking off, Forti as well as a few other Romney loyalists formed a super PAC known as Restore Our Future, designed to help the former Massachusetts governor win the Republican presidential nomination. And help him it did. Restore Our Future collected $30 million in 2011 alone and used those millions on an all-out assault on Newt Gingrich that blunted the momentum the former House speaker was building in late 2011 and early 2012 and allowed Romney to secure much-needed victories in New Hampshire, Florida and Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of early March 2012, 371 super PACs had raised more than $130 million for the 2012 campaign. The mightiest were those affiliated with Republican presidential candidates. Restore Our Future led the way, with $34 million collected, followed by Winning Our Future, a super PAC aligned with Gingrich that raised $16 million - almost all of which came from the personal checkbook of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adelson's largess directed to Gingrich is evidence of just how much super PACs have changed the political calculus in the less than two years they have been in existence. During the 2008 contest, a candidate like Gingrich, who has experienced very little success raising money for his official campaign account, would have been forced out of the presidential race months ago - unable to pay his staff, travel the country or run television ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the new super-PAC world, Gingrich needed to convince only one very rich person - Adelson - of his continued viability in the race. Beginning in January, Adelson has cut a series of multimillion-dollar checks to Winning Our Future, which is run by - surprise, surprise - a longtime Gingrich staffer named Rick Tyler. Those donations paid for thousands of television ads in South Carolina, a state Gingrich won in the GOP primary in late January, and helped him secure a victory in his home state of Georgia on March 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without Adelson, Gingrich would have been an afterthought in the 2012 presidential race. With him, Gingrich remained a viable candidate all the way through mid-March. That's how drastically super PACs have changed the field on which the presidential race is being fought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Obama's response          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House was paying close attention to the tens of millions of dollars pouring into Republican super PACs in the first few months of 2012. And it was getting worried. So in February, the White House reversed its stated opposition to such groups. In an e-mail sent to supporters, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina argued that the move was born of necessity: &quot;We decided to do this because we can't afford for the work you're doing in your communities, and the grassroots donations you give to support it, to be destroyed by hundreds of millions of dollars in negative ads,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama political team made a very simple political calculation. It could reverse course, take the near-term hit from campaign finance reform advocates and reap the long-term financial benefits, or stay the course and run the risk of being outspent in 2012. Viewed that way, the decision was a no-brainer and had echoes of President Obama's decision in 2008 to go back on his promise to abide by public financing once it became clear that he could dramatically outraise McCain in the fall campaign. His Republican critics lambaste Obama as an ideologue, but decisions such as the one on super PACs make clear that he is, at heart, a political pragmatist. Which, of course, is why he's president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What secret has Forti figured out that inspires such fear in the White House? He insists that there is no secret, and if he knows one, he certainly isn't telling. He attributes his success to &quot;keeping my head down and doing my job,&quot; adding: &quot;I'm not a self-promoter. I'm not on TV all the time.&quot; (What's wrong with being on TV all the time? But I digress.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forti's preference to be behind the scenes rather than in front of the camera may be key to understanding why he has been affiliated with the two most successful super PACs on record. These organizations function on privacy; donors are the most skittish of political animals and need to know that the people they are dealing with can keep a secret. (Donors also want to know that their money is being well spent or they will stop giving, Forti said. &quot;You can't convince these folks to give the type of money they are giving if they don't think they are having an impact,&quot; he added.) Forti's great gift then is his discretion. He is a vault, and donors - and the staffers he works with - know it. That's why they tell him things. And that's why he's the super PAC whisperer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Four months after it started up, Upworthy, a news aggregation site built on social sharing, is gaining traction and drawing attention to content that is often ignored. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if this article began with a link to a chart on media consolidation? Would you click it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if, instead, this article began with a promise that it would tell you &quot;The Real Reason They Still Play 'Mrs. Robinson' on the Radio.&quot; Would you click that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if they wereboth the same thing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upworthy, a news aggregation site that began publishing on March 26, is serious news built for a spreadable age, with super clicky headlines and a visually oriented user interface. Eli Pariser, the former executive director of MoveOn.org, and Peter Koechely, a former managing editor of The Onion who also worked at MoveOn, noticed that much of the media that gets shared online is built on cute animals and dumb humans that are good for a laugh, but not much else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the backing of Chris Hughes, one of the founders of Facebook who recently bought The New Republic, the pair and a staff of 11 people in eight cities are promoting information and news that has serious dimensions, using the tendency of the social media world to share stories. &quot;We want to give people the information and tools that help make them better, more aware citizens,&quot; said Mr. Pariser. Their version of citizenry tilts left, or as Mr. Pariser put it, &quot;people who believe global warming exists and gay people should be able to get married.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weird part? It seems to be working. Last week, Upworthy had 1 million unique visitors according to its Google Analytics, and in the month of June, its third full month of operations, the site had 2.5 million uniques, which means the site is off to a faster start by some measures than Mediaite, The Huffington Post and Business Insider. Recently, Upworthy's poke at Mitt Romney over hismisuse of Venn diagrams got a shout out from Rachel Maddow; this week, the company is having its first face-to-face meeting of employees at a retreat in Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By putting tasty headlines on nutritious subjects -- chocolate sauce on brussels sprouts, as it were -- Upworthy can make the sharing impulse work on topics beyond LOLCats and fashion disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Pariser and Mr. Koechely thought there might be some traction in their approach in November 2011 when the gay marriage debate was raging. There was a remarkable piece of video in which an earnest young man from Iowa talked about what it was like to be raised by parents who were both women. It was an articulate defense of families in all forms and received about 700,000 views on YouTube. Angie Aker, who worked with the pair at MoveOn, came up with a new headline: &quot;Two lesbians raised a baby and this is what they got.&quot; Five days later, it had 17 million views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a question right now of what information will run the gauntlet of social sharing on Twitter and Facebook and actually show up as part of the conversation,&quot; said Mr. Pariser, who wrote &quot;The Filter Bubble,&quot; a book on how the Web is presenting information based on user history and creating verticals of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Upworthy is a mission-driven business,&quot; said Mr. Pariser. &quot;We try to get stuff that matters into the information stream, and to do that, we have to scale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;hits&quot; on Upworthy are all over the map.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What Happens To 3 Out Of 4 Girls After Leafing Through A Fashion Mag For 3 Minutes?&quot; was about a video on body image. 101 Books To Read This Summer Instead of '50 Shades of Grey' was a charticle about summer reading designed to enrich the mind instead of emptying it out. This Is How You Kill an Attack Ad was about how the Obama administration knocked down an attack ad sponsored by the Koch brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upworthy optimizes content for social sharing to build traffic and, to generate revenue, works with causes to connect them to an audience in return for a referral fee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Hughes knew Mr. Pariser and Mr. Koechley from his time as coordinator of online organizing for the Obama campaign in 2008, and he, along with others, decided to invest in Upworthy because it seems to be able to pull information out of the current day clutter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in the media business often think they have to choose between mass appeal and substance,&quot; Mr. Hughes said in an e-mail. &quot;What I love about Upworthy -- and what excites me about the significant traction they're getting -- is the plan to do both at the same time. Eli and Peter have an instinctive sense of what drives people to share on the Internet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like The Onion, the editorial team at Upworthy begins with dozens of headlines and works on them until they create what Mr. Pariser called &quot;a curiosity gap&quot; -- a need to know more that prompts the impulse to click on something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means when the site wants to shine a light on a video about a multinational sprawling octopus, it just asks a simple question and answers it. &quot;How Can One Company Run Nuclear Arsenals, Schools, And Even Time Itself? Like This.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The total, raised through Mitt Romney's campaign and the Republican National Committee, reflects the rapid coalescence of the Republican donor establishment around Mr. Romney.&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10:42 a.m. | Updated Mitt Romney and the Republican National Committee easily outraised President Obama and the Democrats in June, pulling in $106.1 million, a substantial increase in Mr. Romney's fund-raising pace and a sign of the growing competitiveness of the battle for campaign dollars against Mr. Obama, who raised $71 million during the same period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign did not release a breakdown for how much was raised by Mr. Romney's campaign, which can accept checks of no larger than $2,500 for the general election, and the Republican National Committee, which can accept checks more than 10 times that size, along with tens of thousands of dollars more per donor that is forwarded to state parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign, which raised $76.8 million in May, has said it hopes to raise a total of at least $800 million for the election, a goal that would require Mr. Romney and the Republican National Committee to average roughly $100 million a month in combined fund-raising through Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This month's fund-raising is a statement from voters that they want a change of direction in Washington,&quot; said Spencer Zwick, Mr. Romney's finance chairman, in a statement.<BR><BR>In an e-mail to supporters, the Obama campaign portrayed the $71 million fund-raising figure as &quot;good news,&quot; but then added: &quot;We still got beat. Handily. Romney and the RNC pulled in a whopping $106 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Obama, the financial disadvantage represents a big turnaround from the position he enjoyed four years ago, in his successful race against Senator John McCain of Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that race, Mr. Obama outspent his rival by a two-to-one margin, raising huge sums of money for television commercials and organizing after forgoing the public financing system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, both candidates have shunned public financing in favor of their own fund-raising prowess. And in the last two months, Mr. Romney has easily outraised Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the e-mail to supporters, Ann Marie Habershaw, the Obama campaign's chief operating officer, warned that the impact of the financial situation for the president could be dire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we lose this election, it will be because we didn't close the gap enough when we had the chance,&quot; she wrote in the e-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gap is especially striking because it does not count the fund-raising success that conservative groups like Crossroads GPS and Restore our Future, a &quot;super PAC&quot; backing Mr. Romney, have been having in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high total for Mr. Romney reflects the rapid unification of the Republican donor establishment around his candidacy after he formally clinched the party's presidential nomination contest in late May and began devoting much of his schedule to fund-raising events. As the party's presumptive nominee, Mr. Romney can raise money jointly with the Republican National Committee, extracting far more money from each wealthy donor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, as the incumbent, has had a similar fund-raising arrangement in place with the Democratic National Committee for well over a year, allowing him to raise far more money than Mr. Romney in the early months of the campaign. But people with knowledge of Mr. Obama's fund-raising said that the Democrats were likely to report a lower number for June than the Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign has said it raised $4.2 million from roughly 42,000 donors in the hours after the Supreme Court upheld Mr. Obama's landmark health care bill on June 28.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banking Official Faces Panel in Barclays Scandal &nbsp;|&nbsp; The scandal over the manipulation of global interest rates until now has mostly put bankers in the spotlight. But the focus on Monday will turn to the regulators, both on what they did and what they did not do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Tucker, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, will give evidence on whether senior government officials put pressure on Barclays to lower its submissions to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Barclays agreed in late June to pay about $450 million to settle accusations from United States and British authorities that its traders and senior executives had manipulated the rate, which underpins trillions of dollars of corporate loans, home mortgages and derivatives around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tucker's testimony could put him at loggerheads with Robert E. Diamond Jr., the former chief executive of Barclays, who told the same committee last week that the Bank of England, as well as the Financial Services Authority of Britain and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, had repeatedly been informed about the issue, but had not moved to stop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony is scheduled to begin at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time. DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WellPoint to Acquire Amerigroup for $4.9 Billion &nbsp;|&nbsp; WellPoint, one of the country's largest health insurers, has agreed to buy Amerigroup in a bid to bolster its Medicaid business as the industry undergoes an overhaul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company said the transaction, which is expected to close early next year, is valued at about $4.9 billion. Under the deal, WellPoint will pay $92 a share in cash for all outstanding shares of Amerigroup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal will give the combined company's Medicaid business a presence in 19 states, according to a news release announcing the deal. The move comes as the insurance industry, and Medicaid, face significant changes under the Obama administration's health care reform plan. DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The author of this week's cover article answers questions about the motivations of the people who run Priorities USA Action, a Democratic Super PAC. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did this article on Democratic super PACs come about?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editors of the magazine and I had been chewing on the question of how to do a human-driven super-PAC story. I tend to gravitate toward the experiential aspect of a topic: how a president's B.F.F. (Valerie Jarrett) exerts her influence in the White House; how the operation of a political rogue (Sarah Palin) functions; what it's like to be the guy whose job it is to bring the House's Tea Party freshmen in line (Kevin McCarthy). In this case, I decided it would be interesting to show how Democrats slowly shed their (professed) disdain of big-money politics and embraced the world of super PACs - and to do this by showing how two novices to that world, Bill Burton and Sean Sweeney, built theirs from the ground up and then endeavored to sell it to a not-so-waiting world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You write about a couple, the Mostyns, who welcome Priorities USA Action. But what's the most common reason people say no to a super PAC?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are four. In no particular order:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1) The belief that Obama can't possibly lose to Romney (this reason began to dissipate after the antics of the G.O.P. primaries were concluded).<BR>2) The belief that the Obama campaign organization would be raising all the money it would need anyway.<BR>3) Disillusionment with the president vis-&agrave;-vis progressive ideals and na&iuml;vet&eacute; about the G.O.P. as willing legislative partners.<BR>4) A basic distaste for super PACs and the attack ads they fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama openly shares that distaste. Do you think that Bill Burton, who helped found the Priorities super PAC after working in the White House, also felt this way?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton was pretty candid on the subject. Sure, he said, it's a lousy system and ought to be reformed. But to paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld - and Burton did exactly that - you go with the rules you have, not the rules you wish you had. I don't think he and Sweeney spend a minute of their day fretting about the amorality of the world in which they operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were you surprised by how&nbsp;super-PAC people rationalize their work?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the world of presidential campaigning, you really can't luxuriate in self-doubt or navel-gazing. Things move too quickly, and day-to-day battles are waged. I guess what continues to surprise me is how quotidian it has become to attack-attack-attack, and how nearly everything is fair game for ridicule. That, and the fact that we're in a recession, with millions of people out of work, and yet upward of a billion dollars will be spent in this election simply to fill the airwaves with invective. These are not original thoughts, I realize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What impressed the Mostyns most, it seemed, was that Priorities found workers who could blame Bain for losing their jobs. How did they find those folks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Basically, their researcher Brennan Bilberry behaved like a good reporter. He read every news item from the '90s pertaining to employees who were laid off by Bain. He located those people, talked to them by phone, got their stories and ascertained whether they'd be willing to share said stories in an attack ad. Then another person was sent to interview the Bain victims in person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does Priorities USA Action have another strategy in mind, or is Attack Bain plan A, B and C, with no plan D?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're constantly poll-testing themes and angles, and it's possible that some new leitmotif worthy of exploitation will emerge - for example, when Governor Romney announces his running mate. The reality, however, is that Priorities doesn't have enough money to heave against the wall to see what sticks. They've pretty much got to hone what they have and take dead aim with it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Page, USA TODAY WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Pg. 1A</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1579 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most of the country, just about the only time campaign ads for the presidential candidates are on TV is when there's a news story about the ads. In the handful of battleground states that are likely to decide the outcome of the election, though, viewers can't escape arguably the most intense early barrage of ads in American political history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a swing state, you're part of the presidential campaign,&quot; says political scientist Darrell West, author of Air Wars. &quot;Everywhere else, you're outside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new USA TODAY/Gallup Poll of swing states, an overwhelming majority of voters remember seeing campaign ads over the past month; most voters in other states say they haven't. In the battlegrounds, one in 12 say  the commercials have changed their minds about President Obama or Republican Mitt Romney -- a difference on the margins, but one that could prove crucial in a close race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point, Obama is the clear winner in the ad wars. Among swing-state voters who say the ads have changed their minds about a candidate, rather than just confirmed what they already thought, 76% now support the president, vs. 16% favoring Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We gave them new information,&quot; says Obama campaign manager Jim Messina. &quot;Romney had been out there claiming success as governor,&quot; but Democratic ads have prompted voters to &quot;take a look at his record&quot; on job creation and as head of the private-equity firm Bain Capital. Messina also credits a $25 million buy for a positive ad &quot;about the challenges the president inherited and what we had to do to move this country forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, Obama's ads have done more to win back  Democrats than to win over independents or Republicans: Thirteen percent  of Democrats say their minds have been changed by ads, compared with 9% of independents and  3% of Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney pollster Neil Newhouse calls the findings unsurprising. &quot;It is expected to find that more voters say their views have changed about Mitt Romney; they simply don't know him all that well,&quot; he says. &quot;On the other hand, there are few voters who are going to say their views have changed about President Obama. They know him pretty damned well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and his allies have outspent Romney's side on ads so far by almost a third. Although the TV spots didn't start earlier than in recent elections, there have been more  than ever before -- including a negative flood from the new breed of super PACs -- and they are continuing without the traditional summertime letup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 12 battleground states, the race is all but tied. Obama leads Romney 47%-45% among 1,200 registered voters in the poll  June 22-29 -- a tick closer than Obama's 48%-44% lead among 2,404 voters in the rest of the USA over the same  period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The swing states survey focuses on a dozen states that aren't firmly aligned with either Democrats or Republicans. That puts them in a position to tip the outcome in the Electoral College. The states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates expend enormous time and effort raising money in such cities as New York, Los Angeles and Houston so they can then spend most of that money on ads in such media markets as Colorado Springs, Orlando and Richmond, Va.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their target: voters like Jessica Bruning, 28, of Holstein, Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't get a chance to see the news a lot,&quot; Bruning, who was called in the USA TODAY Poll, said in a follow-up phone interview. &quot;I have two kids and go to school and work. Seeing the ads every day helps me catch up. I see what they are going to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has she learned? That Obama has been pushing to keep student loan rates low -- she's attending community college to be certified as a welder, so that's an important issue for her -- and that Romney &quot;wants to cut taxes for the rich people and raise them for the poor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think that's cool,&quot; she says. She plans to vote for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remembering the negative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than three of four voters in the battlegrounds say they've seen campaign ads on TV over the past month. They're more likely to recall the negative ones, which have included a barrage attacking the president's stewardship of the economy and depicting Romney as a heartless corporate executive. Nearly two-thirds have seen negative ads about Romney and almost seven in 10 negative ones about Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, man, you can't turn on the local network -- it's every other one is a campaign commercial for somebody,&quot; says Trish McConnell, 57, of Jacksonville.  She plans to vote for Romney. &quot;I just really am disappointed with the way our country is going,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week alone, the presidential candidates and outside groups supporting them spent nearly $15 million on advertising in the Sunshine State and other battlegrounds, according to data from the ad-tracking firm SMG Delta as reported by NBC. The Romney campaign bought $4.3 million in ads, and the conservative super PAC Americans for Prosperity an additional $2.6 million. The Obama campaign bought $6.5 million and the pro-Obama Priorities USA Action $1.4 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's about to get even more intense: The two sides are poised to spend $100 million on ads over the next month, The Washington Post calculates. Since advertising began for the general election, Romney and his allies have spent  $85 million on TV spots, according to NBC/SMG Delta. Obama and his supporters have spent $110 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've seen quite a few of them, but I try to get my information from a plethora of sources out there,&quot; says Bruce Rosemark, 63, of Las Vegas, a retired bank employee who was among those surveyed. &quot;Normally the ads you see on TV are pretty much knocked down to the lowest common denominator and appeal mostly to emotion and half-truths on both sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many voters say they dislike the campaign ads as too negative, distrust them as inaccurate and deny that they affect their opinions.  Seven of 10 say the TV ads simply confirm what they already think about the candidates. &quot;I figure it's all a bunch of hooey anyway,&quot; says Ken Kelly, 72, a retired steelworker from Alliance, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 8% acknowledge the ads changed their minds about a candidate, for better or worse, though analysts say the actual number is probably higher because some voters don't want to admit or may not even realize their views were affected. Obama leads among those voters  nearly 5-to-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Rosemark, a conservative, says Democratic ads criticizing Romney's history in Massachusetts got his attention. &quot;It did make me look a little bit about what his record was,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's passive learning, passive effects,&quot; says Michael Franz of Bowdoin College in Maine, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. &quot;Voters may not know per se that an ad has changed their mind.  It may be moving their perceptions slightly in ways they're not cognizant of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Goldstein, a political scientist and president of Kantar Media CMAG, which monitors political ads, says even a small effect could have decisive consequences. He cites the razor-thin margins in Florida and elsewhere in the 2000 election. &quot;Listen, I think the political-advertising impact is pretty modest -- a small effect that only matters on the margins,&quot; he says. &quot;But ask Al Gore if the margin matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Front-row seats'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swing-state voters are a bit more enthusiastic about voting this year than those living elsewhere, perhaps reflecting the attention they're given in TV ads and candidate visits. Nearly half of those in battleground states are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting for president this year. Just under three in 10 aren't keen about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the battlegrounds, the most enthusiastic voters outnumber the least enthusiastic ones by 17 percentage points. In the non-battlegrounds, the difference is 12 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters who are being exposed to the bombardment of ads feel like they're in the game,&quot; says Tobe Berkovitz, an advertising professor at Boston University and a former political media buyer. &quot;They have front-row seats for the presidential campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USA TODAY poll shows that Republicans, who lagged in enthusiasm in the last swing states survey, have gained an edge now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may reflect growing comfort with Romney becoming  the nominee now that the GOP primaries are over. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 30% say they are extremely enthusiastic about voting, up 5 points from the spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 23% are extremely enthusiastic, a 3-point dip from the last survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, battleground voters say,  4-to-1, that they are ready for this election to end already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were asked which better describes them: You can't wait for this election to begin? Or you can't wait for this election to be over? Eight in 10 chose the latter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They last so long,&quot; says Corey Cunningham, 26, a graduate student in music composition at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sort of voter fatigue could present challenges for both campaigns over the next four months, when the flood of TV ads is guaranteed to get fiercer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ads do have a limited shelf life,&quot; Franz says. &quot;Any gains would disappear if you stop.&quot; But by the end of the campaign, he cautions, people could &quot;just roll their eyes at the advertising. They'll say, 'I get it; I know it; stop talking to me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pam Jopson, 51, of Rockingham, N.C., already tries to dodge the ads. &quot;I mostly DVR everything and edit the ads out,&quot; the mental-health professional says. &quot;They can ruin your day.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether political ads are positive or negative is in the eye of the beholder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider: Seventy percent of Democrats in  a new USA TODAY/Gallup Poll of 12 swing states say  they have seen positive ads for President Obama on TV over the past month, but just 53% of Republicans say they've seen them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why the disparity?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason might be that the Obama campaign has targeted positive ads to appear during programs and on stations watched mostly by Democrats, although that seems unlikely to account for such a wide difference. Another factor might be that voters discount, disregard or don't even notice a positive ad for a candidate they oppose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're not looking to buy a car and there are all these car ads on TV, you may see them but they don't go into your head,&quot; says Ken Goldstein,  president of the Kantar Media CMAG, which tracks political ads.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic recovery again became the focus of the presidential race last week as both President Obama and presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney took to the campaign trail to address the need to create jobs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Labor Department jobs report released Friday found that unemployment remained at 8.2 percent, Romney blamed Obama's tax policies and new regulations in the Affordable Care Act for burdening small businesses and hindering job creation.           &quot;Obamacare is costing jobs in America ... making it less likely for small businesses to hire,&quot; Romney said in Wolfeboro, N.H. &quot;Financial regulations are [making it] less likely for banks to make loans to small businesses ... We've looked at now four years of policies that have not gotten America working again.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, campaigning in Ohio, said the jobs report is &quot;a step in the right direction&quot; but that &quot;we can't be satisfied.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a two-day bus tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania, Obama attacked Romney's business record - specifically that Bain Capital, the private equity firm Romney once ran, invested in companies that moved jobs overseas.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governor Romney's experience has been in owning companies that were called pioneers of outsourcing,&quot; he said at a campaign stop in Maumee, Ohio, ABC News reported. &quot;My experience has been in saving the American auto industry.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ohio, Obama reiterated his previous support for tax incentives to companies that bring back jobs to the United States, saying that unlike Romney, &quot;I want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas, start rewarding companies that are investing right here in Toledo, right here in Ohio, right here in Maumee.&quot;hoc@washpost.com</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One day in April, Paul Begala, a former Bill Clinton political strategist and CNN analyst, placed a phone call to a wealthy and left-leaning 41-year-old Houston lawyer named Steve Mostyn. Begala is himself a Texan, albeit one who gives off the jittery vibe of a Catskills comedian, and the two men have a few friends in common. But Mostyn, a frequent giver to Democratic causes, quickly intuited that this wasn't a social call. Begala reminded Mostyn that he was now working as a consultant for Priorities USA Action, a so-called super PAC run by Bill Burton and Sean Sweeney, former White House senior staff members, that was committed to Barack Obama's re-election. He and Burton would be coming to Houston on Friday, April 13, Begala said. Could they arrange for a meeting?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'll be in Fort Lauderdale that day on my boat,'' Mostyn replied. ''You're welcome to join me there.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The invitation was not thoroughly sincere, evidenced by the fact that Mostyn did not inform Begala where his boat would be docked. Nonetheless, at noon sharp on Friday the 13th, Begala (who is prone to seasickness) and Burton (who had taken a red-eye flight from San Francisco, where he spent the previous afternoon giving his pitch to wealthy progressives at the Telegraph Hill home of the Taco Bell heir Rob McKay), materialized at the correct Fort Lauderdale marina, each wearing jeans and bearing iPads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the uninitiated, ''boat'' is Texan for ''yacht.'' Burton and Begala climbed aboard the outsize Mostyn vessel, All or Nothing, and the attractive first mate handed them cans of Michelob Ultra. A four-hour conversation ensued. Mostyn and his wife, Amber (who is also an attorney), were congenial but blunt. They were not fans of super PACs -- political action committees that can receive unlimited donations from individuals, corporations and unions, usually for the purpose of saturating the airwaves with attack ads -- and were appalled by the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, which made such entities possible. For that matter, the Mostyns weren't entirely happy with Obama. The president had been far too accommodating to Republicans -- ''naive,'' as Amber Mostyn expressed it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We hear that a lot,'' Burton conceded. Burton was a White House deputy press secretary under Obama, and at age 34, he has spent his career as a happy warrior spewing Democratic messages from behind a lectern or on cable TV. But a big part of his new role involves shutting up and listening to rich Democrats vent about his former boss's deficiencies. Gently he reminded his hosts, ''But things will only be worse if he's not re-elected.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mostyns acknowledged not wanting to see Mitt Romney in the Oval Office. Still, they wondered how any donation could possibly make a difference. ''They're spending ridiculous amounts of money on the other side,'' Amber Mostyn said. ''All the crazy commercials they're going to put up -- how do you combat that?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton was ready for this question. ''You don't do it dollar for dollar,'' he said. He whipped out his iPad and showed the Mostyns a few slides from his PowerPoint presentation. The slides included polling data indicating voters' lack of familiarity with Romney's business record at the private-equity firm Bain Capital, as well as financial figures from the 2010 midterm election showing how well-spent donations could help a Democrat prevail over a better-financed Republican opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Burton pulled up something else on his screen: raw video footage that Priorities intended to use for attack ads against Romney. Appearing were the somber images of several men and women who were laid off by Bain. The individuals were tracked down by Brennan Bilberry, the super PAC's 26-year-old research director, and persuaded to tell their stories on camera. One of these was a middle-aged paper-mill worker named Mike Earnest, who had been asked to help build a 30-foot stage that Bain officials would later stand upon while announcing to Earnest and other millworkers that they were being laid off. ''Turns out that when we built that stage,'' Earnest said in a flat Midwestern cadence, ''it was like building my own coffin.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Mostyn was impressed by their research. He asked them what sort of donation they were talking about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''One million dollars,'' was the reply. The Mostyns had never given anywhere near that kind of money to a candidate in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''And we'd like it right away,'' Burton said. He explained that TV ad rates were cheaper to buy far in advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defining the opponent early was crucial, Begala pointed out. ''That's what we did to Bob Dole in 1996,'' he said. ''It's what the Bush campaign did to John Kerry in 2004.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton added, ''Because voters at this point don't know much about Romney, every dollar we spend now is worth more, exponentially.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amber Mostyn wanted to know how they were going to re-energize a Democratic base that has been disillusioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not our role, Burton explained. Though presidential campaigns and their supporting super PACs are forbidden to communicate with one another, a division of labor was mutually understood. It was up to the Obama campaign to be the keeper of the president's story, Burton said. Priorities would focus on ''defining'' Romney, and in the process, destroying him. And to do that, it needed the Mostyns and many people like them to get over their distaste for the Citizens United decision and their frustration with the president and write a very large check, because that's what was happening every day on the other side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton and his best friend, Sean Sweeney, are knockaround political operatives from working-class backgrounds who had never spent a day in the genteel stratum of fund-raising before they started their super PAC 16 months ago. Their chief qualification for the job, beyond the fact that no one else wanted it, was their shared appreciation for the devastating work that well-financed outside groups can do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton and Sweeney both worked for Rahm Emanuel during the 2006 midterm elections, when Emanuel was directing the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's successful drive to win back the House. Unions and other outside groups played a huge role during that cycle by tarring-and-feathering Republicans as corrupt and wedded to the increasingly unpopular policies of President George W. Bush. In the spring of 2008, a Democratic PAC calling itself Progressive Media USA, whose advisers included Begala, began to raise tens of millions of dollars from big-name donors to pay for attack ads against John McCain. The intent was to keep Progressive Media in place well after the election as a magnet for deep-pocketed progressives; as one of its organizers wistfully told me, ''Imagine where we'd be if we had that in place four years later.'' But the Obama campaign -- which was building its own fund-raising behemoth, even at the expense of the candidate's earlier pledge to accept public financing and the spending cap that came with it -- didn't want outside interference. The campaign sent out a 30-year-old spokesman named Bill Burton to shut Progressive Media down by telling the press, ''From the beginning of this race, Obama has told supporters that if they want to help his effort, they should do so through his campaign.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years later, President Obama repeatedly denounced the conservative super PACs that had cropped up in the wake of the Citizens United decision. In so doing, Obama ended up unilaterally disarming Democrats while animating Republicans. ''When Obama attacked us by name in the fall of 2010, accusing us of taking money from the Chinese, it was basically the best fund-raising pitch we could've made,'' says Jonathan Collegio, a spokesman for American Crossroads, the conservative super PAC conceived by Karl Rove and the Republican consultant Ed Gillespie. ''We raised $13 million the week after they attacked us.'' Burton and Sweeney watched from the White House -- more with rueful admiration than moral outrage -- as the Republicans turned the tables, outspending Democratic groups by $100 million and taking back the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three months after the midterms, Burton learned that he was not chosen to succeed Robert Gibbs as White House press secretary. Gibbs had not recommended his deputy for the job (which went to Vice President Joseph Biden's spokesman, Jay Carney) -- perhaps, as some have suggested, because of Burton's youth, or because the deputy had openly campaigned for the job after having been requested not to do so. Several in the White House, including the president, urged Burton to stay on. Whatever Gibbs and others might have found lacking in him, he had proved himself to be an agile stand-in for the press secretary, one who seemed to relish trading punches with Fox News hosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton is one of those ever-ascending Washingtonians whose brazen optimism seems not to have been dampened in the slightest by the cynical world he inhabits. When asked how he's doing, he routinely, and often defiantly, replies, ''Best day of my life.'' He has been a political spokesman his entire adult life and is married to a former Clinton White House aide, Laura Burton Capps, herself the daughter of Congresswoman Lois Capps and Congressman Walter Capps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The son of a metal-foundry worker in Buffalo who, Burton says, ''was on his feet on concrete floors all day, carrying 50-pound bags of different chemical alloys and inhaling the world's worst pollutants,'' Burton learned two things by the time he was 11. The first -- which arrived as an epiphany while watching the 1988 vice-presidential debate between Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle on the family's black-and-white TV -- was that ''I wanted to be in politics, and I wanted to be at the highest level.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second revelation was that he was black. Burton's father was African-American and his mother was Polish. One day in elementary school he identified himself as ''other'' on a standardized test. ''My fifth-grade teacher said, 'No, you're black -- mark that you're black,' '' he told me. ''I was just like, 'Oh, I'm black.' Just another piece of information.'' With little effort, he navigated both sides of the racial divide, reserving his energies for political climbing. After graduating from the University of Minnesota in 1999, he made repeated visits to the campus office of Al Gore's presidential campaign, wearing them down until they gave him the title of deputy press secretary. At age 22, he took a job on the Hill as a Congressional aide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But presidential politics was Burton's goal. Leveraging every Washington contact he had, Burton persuaded Senator Tom Harkin (who campaigned for the presidency in 1992) to hire him as his press secretary. When Harkin elected to stay out of the 2004 race, Burton jumped ship and became Dick Gephardt's communications director in Iowa. When Gep/hardt faltered, the gabby and incessant Burton joined the Kerry campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late 2006, Burton managed to network his way into a job interview with Senator Barack Obama, whose famous speech at the 2004 Democratic convention Burton watched ''over and over, the way some kids have seen 'Star Wars' a hundred times,'' he told me. The two men spoke only briefly of their shared biracial experience. Instead, the Iowa caucuses were on the senator's mind. Burton had experience there. He recalls suggesting that Obama shoot for ''a respectable third place, maybe an unlikely second.'' Obama disagreed. He assured Burton that he would win Iowa. Soon after, Burton became one of the earliest senior staff members to join Obama's underdog campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though his ambitions eventually met a brick wall with the news that he would not be the White House's top spokesman, Burton was not going to let a bruised ego befoul relationships that he spent years cultivating. As the deputy press secretary was leaving the building in February of last year, it happened that his pal Sean Sweeney -- who had been the top aide to Rahm Emanuel, until Emanuel decided to run for mayor of Chicago -- was also in search of a new career. Sweeney is 40, dry-witted and a career backstage political technician, more than content to cede the limelight to the Burtons and Emanuels while immersing himself in the minutiae of precinct voting data and efficient ad markets. The two ex-Obamaites spent the month of February at Tunnicliff's Tavern on Capitol Hill and halfheartedly mulled over opening a consulting shop together. But Burton had not lost his appetite for presidential politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweeney and Burton kicked around the idea of starting a pro-Obama super PAC with fellow Democrats. None of them fretted aloud that going toe to toe with Karl Rove and the Koch brothers would amount to fighting above their weight -- that, as one conservative super PAC affiliate would say to me, ''the more appropriate analog to Rove and Gillespie would be James Carville and Ed Rendell,'' the former Pennsylvania governor. But if the chief function of a super PAC is to kneecap an opponent, the two campaign veterans seemed to have ample experience. That their profiles were relatively obscure, their financial resources meager and their fund-raising experience nonexistent did not apparently deter them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because they lacked the money for an office (and because, as Burton told me, ''it's a little too obvious to meet at Starbucks''), Burton and Sweeney took all of their early meetings in the lobby of the Mayflower Hotel. Begala was the first to sign on as a paid consultant; Terry McAuliffe, the former D.N.C. chairman, was the first to say no, citing other commitments. Teddy Johnston, the Obama campaign's Florida finance director, became their chief fund-raiser. Sweeney knew Geoff Garin, a Democratic consultant, from when they worked together for Senator Charles E. Schumer and persuaded him to handle their polling. Ellen Malcolm of Emily's List and the America Coming Together PAC agreed to provide regular consultation. Harold Ickes, the former Clinton White House deputy chief of staff and Media Fund PAC president, became president of Priorities USA Action. He recalls warning them: ''It's hard, fund-raising. You have to raise it in big chunks. Of the $200 million we raised, $95 million of that came from five sources. And you don't just walk in and ask for that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took several weeks for Burton and Sweeney to come up with a name for their start-up. To their irritation, every slogan they considered had already been trademarked by Republicans. ''We gave our lawyer 10 more names,'' Burton recalls. ''Then like 50. We're literally trying every combination of whatever. You can't come up with a name that has the word 'future' in it that the Republicans don't control. Romney's Restore Our Future -- that doesn't even make sense, and that's probably why they were able to get it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually they settled on Priorities USA Action. As a backhanded homage to Karl Rove, Burton and Sweeney explicitly modeled the two-headed corpus of their brainchild after American Crossroads. One side would consist of a tax-exempt political action committee covered by section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, to which named individuals and groups could donate in unlimited amounts. Its companion entity, Priorities USA, permissible under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code, could, like its counterpart Crossroads GPS, receive unlimited funds by undisclosed donors, provided that the ''social welfare'' organization did not pursue political activities as its ''primary purpose.'' (The two phrases in quotation marks are, needless to say, hazily defined. ''Priorities USA, like Crossroads GPS, has one purpose, and that's to elect and defeat candidates,'' says Fred Wertheimer of the campaign watchdog group Democracy 21. ''They're blowing smoke when they claim they're a 'social welfare' organization in the business of discussing issues.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was, however, one fundamental difference between Priorities and its conservative counterparts. According to Politico, Rove's organization had vowed to raise $300 million for the 2012 election -- which, when coupled with Restore Our Future ($100 million) and the outside groups of oil and chemical billionaires Charles and David Koch ($400 million), would amount to an $800 million war chest. Burton and Sweeney's stated goal was $100 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having conceded the arms race before it even began, the Priorities team recognized that its only hope lay in asymmetrical warfare. Making a virtue of their relative puniness, Begala told me: ''Karl's trying to be too comprehensive, playing in too many places on too many levels. He believes in throw-weight, the way the Soviet space program worked: they believed in brute force, while we believed in precision and perfection.'' Priorities would be selective in its ad buys. Knowing that Obama had to keep Pennsylvania in the win column, it would reach for undecided voters in the Pittsburgh exurbs instead of playing in the expensive Philadelphia market. Similarly, Priorities would not bother trying to persuade the elderly (a group whose low support for the president has seemed immovable) but would instead pursue more promising demographic targets (non-college-educated young women in the suburbs, working-class Hispanics in Florida and the West). The pro-Obama super PAC would take dead aim at these very specific pockets of swing voters. Their weapon would be, in Begala's words, ''ruthless, relentless storytelling.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last December -- specifically, on Pearl Harbor Day -- Burton and Sweeney met with a few other Priorities advisers in the Dupont Circle office of the pollster Geoff Garin to decide just what their Romney story would be. They quickly discarded the Romney-as-flip-flopper leitmotif. To say that the Republican lacked a firm set of positions was to concede that he couldn't be defined. Better, they concluded, to assert that Romney in fact possessed beliefs -- very extreme ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton and his colleagues spent the early months of 2012 trying out the pitch that Romney was the most far-right presidential candidate since Barry Goldwater. It fell flat. The public did not view Romney as an extremist. For example, when Priorities informed a focus group that Romney supported the Ryan budget plan -- and thus championed ''ending Medicare as we know it'' -- while also advocating tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, the respondents simply refused to believe any politician would do such a thing. What became clear was that voters had almost no sense of Obama's opponent. While conducting a different focus group -- this one with non-college-educated Milwaukee voters on the eve of Wisconsin's April 3 primary -- Burton and Sweeney were surprised to learn that even after Romney had spent months campaigning, many in the group could not recognize his face, much less characterize his positions. Compounding the Republican nominee's strangely persistent obscurity is that, as Garin told me, ''Romney is not a natural politician in the sense of embracing opportunities to talk about himself.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That left an opening for the Democrats to tell Romney's story, and over the spring they figured out how to do so. Obama's opponent was not an ideologue per se, the Priorities team decided, but instead someone who knows and cares only about wealthy Americans. Burton describes the distinction as ''a top/bottom rather than left/right approach'' -- also known in Republican circles as class warfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best explanatory tool for this narrative would prove to be Romney's tenure at Bain Capital. In this recasting of Romney's self-described chief qualification to be president, the candidate may well be someone who understands how the economy works but cares only about making it work for rich guys like himself. As one participant in the Priorities focus groups told me, ''Businessmen are often highly admired, but there's no real template for somebody with Mitt Romney's type of business experience getting embraced.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bain-bashing is not exactly a novel gambit. Ted Kennedy employed it during Romney's first campaign, the 1994 U.S. Senate race, and succeeded wildly. Newt Gingrich also tried it during this year's Republican primaries, and the tactic blew up in his face, when a pro-Gingrich super PAC released an anti-Bain video full of inaccuracies, which Gingrich then disavowed. To the Beltway press, and perhaps to others as well, what Romney's business did or didn't do two decades ago is old news. Burton and Sweeney acknowledged this problem to me and postulated -- sounding somewhat like Karl Rove as they did so -- that the threat of having one's steel mill shut down doesn't resonate with the elite media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, they insisted, the message would penetrate the membrane of their target audience. More than one member of the Priorities team told me that Romney reminded them of another wooden and reserved Massachusetts politician, Burton's former candidate in 2004, John Kerry -- who, history shows, was defined and thereafter demolished by a masterful if venal tag-team consisting of the Bush campaign and the proto-super PAC Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. And, as the Priorities team well knew, the Swift Boat assault on Kerry's war record was waged with one-twentieth of the backing that the Democrats raised for their anti-Bush PACs. In other words: ruthless, relentless storytelling could be done on the cheap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the first 10 months of its existence, Priorities USA Action managed to raise only $7 million. (Of this, $2 million was seed money from Jeffrey Katzenberg, the C.E.O. of DreamWorks Animation; another $1 million came from the comedian Bill Maher.) Their travails to some degree reflect the Democratic Party's greater struggle with its prim self-perception. From the perspective of many Democrats, this year's foray into post-Citizens United campaigning calls to mind an ''Apocalypse Now''-like journey into the maw of something darker than death itself -- namely, a morality-free zone in which Republicans alone can thrive. ''I think that many Democrats feel that participating in the system would be validating Citizens United, which was a bad and destructive decision,'' Geoff Garin says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sentiment commonly held by Democrats -- so much so that it's part of the standard Priorities pitch to donors -- is that their only motivation to contribute is a moral one, while Republicans like the Koch brothers donate because they stand to make gobs of money if their pro-business candidate is elected. One of Priorities' big donors told me another reason that conservatives are more suited to a post-Citizens United climate than progressives. ''To me, a lot of the super-PAC money on the Republican side comes from hatred,'' he said. ''We Democrats just don't hate like that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that Democrats abhor big money and scorched-earth campaigning requires more than a touch of amnesia. ''In 2004, we had all this energy coming from the horror at what Bush was doing -- we were furious,'' recalls the liberal activist Ellen Malcolm, whose America Coming Together PAC benefited from millions in donations from wealthy Democrats like George Soros. ''George came out of Nazi Europe and looked at this so-called war on terrorism as an all-too-familiar dynamic of governments taking control. Fear and anger are the great motivators in fund-raising. And right now Karl Rove has the fear and anger on his side.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lacking this sort of emotional edge, Priorities struggled against a confluence of inhospitable factors. First among those is that, as Jonathan Collegio of American Crossroads observes, ''Outside money tends to flow toward the party out of power, and to causes to stop things rather than to promote things.'' Burton and Sweeney had to contend with the widely held assumption that the Obama campaign was raising enough money on its own anyway. ''These big donors are smart -- they look at the numbers,'' a prominent Democratic fund-raiser told me. ''They say, 'How's this money they want from me going to have any impact, compared to the $750 million Obama says he's raising?' '' It also did not help that for most of its young life, Priorities operated not only without Obama's endorsement but also in the face of his implicit disapproval -- at least until late last December, when Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, showed his fellow adviser David Axelrod the gross disparity in fund-raising between conservative and liberal groups, prompting an alarmed Axelrod to murmur, ''We've got to show this to the president.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over and over, Burton and Sweeney heard Democrats express distaste for super PACs, disillusionment with Obama and -- during the primary season, anyway -- disbelief that the president was in any danger of losing. (''It's been difficult,'' Sweeney told me in early spring, ''to make the case that Romney's a juggernaut when he's within 2,000 votes of losing Ohio to Rick Santorum.'') As one lackluster monthly F.E.C. disclosure followed another, a new narrative rippled through Washington, and it wasn't about Bain Capital: the Priorities team, it was suggested, was not ready for prime time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's a personal process, asking for checks of this size,'' says Susan McCue, one leader of the Democratic Senate super PAC. ''You need to take the time to talk about the stakes and how their support will make a difference. And you need to assure them that their money will be used efficiently.'' Arguably, the skill sets of driving home a rapid-response message to a roomful of deadline-crazed journalists and charming a tycoon into parting with a million dollars could not be more different. Burton and Sweeney were novices at asking for money, and apparently it showed. Upper-tier Obama associates told me that in the eyes of donors, Burton and Sweeney lacked Rove's stature and Begala's natural salesman's touch. In April, after an attack ad by American Crossroads compelled the Obama campaign to respond by spending its own money for additional TV time -- knowing that Priorities lacked the money to do so -- a clearly annoyed official told me, ''If we had a Karl Rove of our own out there, we wouldn't have had to do this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the super PAC's public face -- a ubiquitous MSNBC talking head, blogger and cajoler of the Washington news media -- Burton bore the brunt of the criticism. The ongoing insinuation that he was out of his depth did not outwardly jostle the spokesman's best-day-of-my-life unsinkability. (''If you didn't read the story and just looked at the pictures . . . I feel like I came out pretty good,'' he wrote me after one particularly withering article.) Burton and Sweeney repeatedly insisted to me that what they termed the ''education process'' was mainly about converting super-PAC-averse Democrats rather than learning on the fly themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, they knew they needed help. By the end of the spring, Priorities had beefed up its fund-raising team to include Diana Rogalle (from the ACT PAC), Susan Holloway Torricelli (former Senator Robert Torricelli's ex- wife and longtime fund-raiser) and Kathleen Daughety (who was previously Senator Michael Bennet's finance director). Mary Beth Cahill, who was Burton's boss on the Kerry campaign, also signed on as a strategic adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Look, Sean and Bill make no bones about it: they'd been on the spending'' -- meaning messaging -- ''side, not the fund-raising side,'' Harold Ickes told me. ''I think they decided to do it because no one else was doing it. It was clearly necessary, and I encouraged them to do it. That said, there are techniques, and it's an art form . . . there's a minuet, almost. And it takes a lot of time, you bet.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 14, the day after their get-together aboard the boat, Steve Mostyn called Begala to say that he would soon be wiring Priorities a million dollars. A month later -- 25 weeks before the general election -- Mostyn's donation would help finance a $10 million TV blitz in the swing states of Colorado, Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Each week featured a somber new anti-Romney testimonial. On May 22, it was that of Loris Huffman, who worked at the Ampad paper mill for 34 years before being laid off by Bain. On June 10, a former steel-mill employee, Donnie Box, appeared in ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days later, The Wall Street Journal reported that the conservative casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson had just pledged money to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future. The amount Adelson was donating was $10 million -- 10 times that of the Mostyns' hard-won contribution, and the sum total of Priorities USA's entire ad buy. A couple of days later, The Huffington Post reported that Adelson might also be cutting $10 million checks to American Crossroads and the Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity. All told, the casino magnate was telling friends, his contributions to right-leaning candidates and causes might well reach $100 million -- a figure by a single Republican donor that matches the amount Priorities has set as its financial goal for the entire 2012 cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Burton read the story about Adelson's contribution to the Romney super PAC, he could think of only one thing to do. ''I sent that article out to every single Democratic donor that I know,'' he would later recall. The subject heading of Burton's e-mail -- minus a profane verb -- was: ''So apparently they're not messing around.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in late May and early June, it wasn't Sheldon Adelson who was drowning out the Priorities ads. Rather, the Obama campaign was inadvertently doing so. Apparently the campaign did not know or did not care about Priorities USA Action's planned mini-blitz, for it released its own two-minute attack video focusing on Bain's closure of GST Steel, which concluded with, ''I'm Barack Obama, and I approved this message.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaction to the ad was swift and overwhelmingly negative. A procession of Democrats -- starting with the Newark mayor and Obama surrogate Cory Booker, followed by former Congressman Harold Ford Jr., the former U.S. Treasury adviser Steven Rattner and former Governor Ed Rendell -- publicly criticized the president for speaking so harshly of private-equity firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton and Sweeney waited out the chatter. They knew that Booker and the rest had deep associations with the financial sector. They also believed in their polling data -- which would be validated in early June by focus groups of suburban mothers conducted in Richmond, Va., and Las Vegas, and also by an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll showing that voters were twice as likely to have a negative opinion of Bain's practices. Besides, beneath all the bluster coming from Obama's fellow Democrats lurked a basic political verity: the leader of the free world is widely seen as having better things to do with his time than trash Mitt Romney's past business life. It was beneath him. But it was hardly beneath Obama's friends residing in the shadows of super PAC world. Quite the opposite: this was exactly what Priorities was set up to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton and Sweeney's creation now appears to be on relatively solid footing. As of late June, the super PAC has amassed a total of $40 million, with almost $20 million in the bank and about a dozen million-dollar donors onboard. Among the most recent is Qualcomm's co-founder Irwin M. Jacobs and his wife, Joan, newcomers to the world of political mega-giving, whom Burton and other Priorities surrogates spent a year courting in person, on the phone and by e-mail before the couple relented and gave $2 million. Priorities' $100 million goal is within reach but by no means assured. ''In order to do that,'' Ickes says, ''we're going to have go get some $5 million and $10 million donors.'' Another Priorities representative says wistfully: ''Maybe there's someone we never heard of. Is there a Charles Koch out there on our side?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 21, Burton returned to Buffalo to deliver the commencement address at City Honors School, from which he graduated in 1995. ''While men and women are remembered for how they succeed,'' the former White House spokesman told his young audience, ''they are defined by how they fail. And by how they come back.'' Late that evening, while Burton was dining out with old high-school buddies and faculty members, a Washington Post article about Romney and Bain Capital appeared on the paper's Web site. The story analyzed filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that showed Bain to have ''owned companies that were pioneers in the practice of shipping work from the United States to overseas call centers and factories.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the restaurant, Burton e-mailed Sweeney and their team. By 10:45 p.m., they had drafted a memo that would be sent to the e-mail addresses of several hundred political reporters by 7 the next morning: ''Despite his phony rhetoric on standing up for American workers, today's Washington Post details how Mitt Romney directly profited from the outsourcing of American jobs overseas.'' Soon they would be adding more Bain-related questions to their polls, seeking to add depth to their narrative, the one best shot their modestly financed super PAC had at persuading swing voters and thereby making a difference in a closely contested presidential election. Burton and Sweeney were doing what they do best, telling the story -- though when it came down to it, getting enough people to listen would still be the hardest part.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVERY few years the 1-percentiness of the Hamptons gets that much 1-percentier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure, there are exclusive staples: P. Diddy's white party; the Apollo in the Hamptons benefit (225 attendees who pay as much as $125,000 a table); and the Hampton Classic, Long Island's answer to Royal Ascot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But nothing says ''I'm kind of a big deal'' like attending one of the quadrennial presidential fund-raisers, which are the social events of the season for well-heeled Hamptonites willing to pay a local carpenter's annual salary -- or much more -- to hobnob with a sitting or potential president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet for one important subset of the East End political class, Democrats, there will be no big-ticket presidential soiree this year. There will be no beachside bragging rights (''I was telling Barack just last night'') and, perhaps as important, no chance to make a casual if expensive suggestion for lighter industry regulations, better campaign commercials or a tweak in his approach to Israel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, they will have to be content with memories of soirees past: John Kerry playing ''Brown Eyed Girl'' under a tent with Jimmy Buffett, with the Atlantic Ocean providing gentle percussion; or the bacon-wrapped Montauk tuna that Daniel Boulud prepared especially for them, and which they washed down with the smooth tonic of Bill Clinton's campaign poetry. Word is trickling out to local, and still-loyal, rich Democrats that President Obama will almost certainly skip the Hamptons fund-raising circuit this election year, leaving all the fun to supporters of his opponent, Mitt Romney, who heads to a trifecta of top-dollar fund-raisers here this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney is expected to pull in $3 million from an event at the Creeks, the estate of Ronald O. Perelman, the billionaire financier and Revlon chairman, where tickets range from $5,000 for lunch to $25,000 for a V.I.P. photo reception. Another will be held at the home of Clifford M. Sobel, an ambassador to Brazil under President George W. Bush, and a final dinner will take place at the Southampton estate of the billionaire industrialist David H. Koch, where the going rate for entry is $75,000 a couple and $50,000 a person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign seeks secrecy when it comes to its fund-raising events, but organizers suggested that these would not be the showstoppers of the Democratic events of yore. As one member of his finance team put it, ''There's enough interest in stopping Obama that you don't need to hire entertainment and celebrity chefs.'' Besides, the real estate should be entertainment enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Mr. Koch's estate, the guests will be treated to one-of-a-kind scenery as they wait for face time with a possible president. Tucked into the Southampton dunes, Mr. Koch's home is valued at about $18 million by the real estate Web site Zillow, which reports that it has seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms. Its backyard is the sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the jewel of the day is Mr. Perelman's. With 9 fireplaces, 40 rooms and an expansive wine cellar, his estate makes the Koch spread look modest by comparison. Sitting on 57 acres, it was built for the painter Albert Herter in 1899, and when it last went up for sale in 1991 (for $25 million), The New York Times described it as ''the largest and most spectacular estate in the Village of East Hampton, with more than a mile of frontage on Georgica Pond and a view of the Atlantic Ocean beyond.'' That article also said that an American Conifer Society Bulletin -- for tree enthusiasts -- had called its grounds ''the eighth wonder of the horticultural world'' and ''the most outstanding private conifer collection in the United States, a living work of art.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Perelman's representatives indicated that lunch on Sunday would be kosher, as Mr. Perelman keeps a kosher home, er, palace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is all a particular letdown for those Democratic Hamptonites who had become accustomed to the go-go days of the Clintons, who were happy to have the adulation, scenery and campaign cash here wash over them like warm late-summer waves. Their midterm 1998 fund-raiser drew the gamut of neighborhood celebrities: Steven Spielberg, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, to name a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Where are the Clintons now that we need them in the Hamptons, vacuuming up money like it's shells on the shore,'' said Ken Sunshine, the public relations executive and Democratic fund-raiser, who has a house in Westhampton. Still, he confessed, ''A lot of people are really bored out there and looking for stuff to do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopes had been raised by chatter of a late-August event featuring the president at Mr. Spielberg's estate by Georgica Pond, but representatives for Mr. Spielberg and the Obama campaign insisted that no such thing had been discussed. There is talk about a visit by Joe Biden, but, well, this is a crowd accustomed to presidential-level service in all things -- including presidential fund-raising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some local Democrats say they believe a factor in the president's absence this year is a reluctance by the White House to pump out images of Mr. Obama mixing behind closed doors (or supersize hedges, as the case may be) with the 0.0001 percent of the nation's wealthiest families as he seeks to paint Mr. Romney as the candidate of the rich. One prominent fund-raiser said the message from Team Obama about the Hamptons has consistently been that ''it creates the wrong image,'' because the campaign does not want to be associated with a ''community that has an elite image.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That has brought fresh rounds of indignation from Obama mega-donors, several of whom said in interviews that it was part of the broader push-pull dynamic between Mr. Obama and the elite class of political financiers whose industries he has at times punched with one hand while seeking a donation with the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on condition of anonymity, because there is no upside in picking a public fight with the White House, more than one of them noted the president's recent appearances with Anna Wintour at the West Village home of Sarah Jessica Parker and with all manner of celebrities at the Hollywood Hills mansion of George Clooney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Patricof, a private equity pioneer and longtime Democratic fund-raiser, said in an interview from his East Hampton estate that he understood the campaign's concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's a mixed blessing whether you do something here or not,'' Mr. Patricof said. ''The Hamptons do have an image that's hard to break, and people can be chastised for accessing this, as much as they can be complimented for being successful and generating a lot of interest.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if to illustrate the very image Mr. Obama's team would certainly want to avoid, a large contingent from liberal groups including Occupy Wall Street, Move On, Greenpeace and the Long Island Progressive Coalition say they plan a protest for Sunday, with the focus primarily on Mr. Koch's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We want everyone who's not arriving by helicopter to have to pass us by and be shamed by us,'' said David Segal, a spokesman for the Long Island group. He said the groups would not go onto Mr. Koch's property. ''We're really hoping to be at the base of his driveway on the road there,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's a good thing over all, given the lengths of the driveways involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats' presidential-year doldrums were made all the more painful by reports that one of the Romney events was to be given at the home of Mr. Perelman, one of whose ex-wives was the Democratic fund-raiser and Clinton ally Patricia Duff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is the crux of the matter, and it goes at something deeper for Mr. Obama: propelled four years ago by small donors swept up in the drama of his candidacy, Mr. Obama did not have to build the same sort of relationships with the mega-donors of Hamptons society that the Clintons learned to court early on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think they had a lot more relationships out here that were more embedded and closer, and it just was seen like a natural thing to do because a great part of their constituency was out here,'' said Mr. Patricof, who has given Hamptons fund-raising events for the Clintons and, in 2004, for Mr. Kerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now well established that Mr. Obama has what can best be described as a dysfunctional relationship with the Wall Street segment of his party, which has at times found itself crosswise with his rhetoric about their industry, not to mention his legislative moves to tighten regulation. Naturally some of that frustration has headed east in the overheads of their Gulfstreams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And among the longtime conservative stalwarts listed as hosts of the Sunday events (Mr. Koch, Lewis M. Eisenberg, Wayne L. Berman, Woody Johnson) are others, most hailing from finance, who, according to campaign filings, have previously donated to Mr. Kerry, the Clintons and, in one case, John Edwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Republicans are super-energized out here,'' said Andrew Sabin, the precious-metals magnate and a host of the event at Mr. Perelman's house, who cited the weekend's $3 million figure. ''And they're getting a lot of interest from Democrats. But a lot of Democrats are afraid to tell you where they are.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither campaign would comment for this article. And neither would Mr. Perelman -- who stayed an independent even as he became a Clinton booster -- agree to an interview. But in a statement, he said: ''Mr. Romney is a longtime good friend. I was asked if I would open my home and I am happy to do so. I think the governor will continue to be an effective powerful leader.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama-supporting, Hamptons-based Democrats may eat their hearts out over it all nonetheless, but they said they would live to donate huge sums another day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We won't take it personally,'' said Robert Zimmerman, a Democratic National Committeeman and prominent party fund-raiser with a home in Southampton. ''We can have overpriced lobster salad at our own homes.''</SPAN></P>

Result: Annual health insurance premiums have increased by $2,393. . . . Gap: health premium costs are $4,893 higher per family than President Obama promised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">- New _blankFacebook/Twitter post by the Romney campaign</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Promises made during the heat of an election campaign sometimes come back to haunt politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaign of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney is trying to nail President Obama for making an iffy promise during the 2008 campaign - that premiums will be $2,500 lower under his health-care plan. Instead, the Romney campaign argues in an effort to create a viral Facebook post, the swing has gone $4,893 the other way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Romney graphic is misleading on several levels, though Obama certainly left himself open to scrutiny with imprecise language in the 2008 campaign. Let's take a look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign cites a statement from _blanka 2007 speech by Obama, but it's a pledge that was repeated often: &quot;When I am president, we will have universal health care in this country by the end of my first term in office. It's a plan that will cover every American and cut the cost of a typical family's premiums by $2,500 a year.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This particular quote is not very clear on when the savings would be realized, but in other speeches, Obama _blanksuggested it would be at the end of his first term.          The details of this $2,500 figure were further explained in _blankan Obama campaign memo:          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             &quot;Combining all of these effects - from improved health IT [information technology], better disease management, reduced insurance overhead, reinsurance, and reduced uncompensated care - under our 'best-guess' assumptions, we estimate that businesses will save $140 billion annually in insurance premiums. The typical family will save $2,500 per year.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But note that Obama's pledge came with an asterisk: He was not saying premiums would fall by that amount, as the Romney graphic asserts, but that costs would be that much lower than anticipated. In other words, if premiums were expected to rise by $5,000, they would rise only by $2,500 - that's what Obama's pledge meant, even if he was not too clear about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Dobbs, our predecessor as The Fact Checker, _blankawarded Obama Two Pinocchios for the pledge, saying it was based on shaky assumptions (such as a Rand Corp. study that was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office) and there was no guarantee that any savings would be passed on to consumers. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org also thought Obama's pledge _blankwas highly dubious.           Of course, once Obama became president, the health-care proposal he advocated as a candidate was significantly changed, even to the point of accepting the individual mandate that he had so criticized when Hillary Rodham Clinton promoted it. But the White House _blankmore or less stuck to the idea that costs would not rise as quickly as previously estimated - except that it would result in $2,000 in savings by 2019. (Recall also that the health-care law will not be fully implemented until 2014, making a first-term pledge problematic.)          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, let's look at what the Romney campaign has done with the pledge. First, it assumes that Obama was saying that premiums would actually decline by $2,500, rather than decline from a projected increase. Then, it takes the _blank2011 Kaiser Family Foundation survey estimate (see Exhibit 1.11) and subtracts the cost of a 2008 family premium ($12,680) from the cost of a 2011 premium ($15,073). Voila, an increase of $2,393 - and a promise gap of $4,893.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Romney campaign's math is nonsensical. First of all, the Kaiser survey is conducted from January to May each year, so starting with the 2008 date makes little sense, since that is still George W. Bush's term. Then the health-care law was not passed until 2010, so the first year in which any impact could be seen from the law was in 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, as the Kaiser report notes, most of the provisions of the new law will not take effect until 2014. Thus far, other provisions, such as providing coverage for adult children up to age 26, appear to have had a modest impact on premiums - perhaps 1 to 2 percentage points. (The White House disputes even that effect.) Still, the full effect on premiums - including any possible savings - will not be seen until the law is completely implemented. We had previously given the Republican National Committee _blankThree Pinocchios for an ad that had focused on the single data point - the increase in premiums from 2010 to 2011 - and blamed all of the increase on the health-care law. Now the Romney campaign has multiplied the same error in an effort to claim that &quot;health premium costs are $4,893 higher per family than President Obama promised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                                The Pinocchio Test                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama in 2008 made a foolish, dubious pledge about health-care premiums. As we have noted, he will have to answer to Americans if his law fails to live up to that promise by 2019 or if people feel misled by his lawyerly wording. He was warned when he got Two Pinocchios back in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But two wrongs don't make a right. The Romney campaign has twisted the meaning of that pledge and then blamed a partially implemented, one-year-old law for three years of premium increases, in order to concoct an absurd claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In nearly every election, voters, the news media - and the candidates themselves - clamor for more honesty from politicians. &quot;I don't know if you know to trust what either side is saying or . . .  are they just saying it to get elected?&quot; a participant told pollster Peter Hart at a recent focus-group gathering of swing voters in Colorado. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But straightforwardness doesn't make for the sexiest of stump speeches. Remember Walter Mondale's 1984 pledge to raise taxes? &quot;Let's tell the truth. . . . Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.&quot;          Mondale lost in a landslide.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem was not that he told the truth, but that Republican ads twisted his words, alleging that, rather than using the new revenue to pay down the deficit, the Democrat would squander it on a social spending spree. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So can an honest candidate, who doesn't distort his opponents' records or rhetoric, win the presidency?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes. Now more than ever, with a public highly anxious about the economy and worn down after years of promises that things would get better, the time is ripe for a candid candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win over the public honestly in 2012, a presidential aspirant would tell us things we need to hear but don't want to. Such a candidate might acknowledge that the United States will be more affected by - than have and effect on - the dramas unfolding in the Middle East and the European Union. An honest candidate would need to specify how he or she would address the more than $1 trillion budget deficit, which might include defense cuts; eliminating some of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts; taxing employer-provided health-care coverage; slowing the growth rate of Social Security and Medicare; phasing in a higher eligibility age for Social Security; eliminating the payroll-tax limit; and getting rid of the interest deduction for some home mortgages. President Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney aren't avoiding this discussion, per se, but they're not offering specific plans for how they'd address the impending crisis, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being honest doesn't stop at self-representation; a candidate should be able to secure support without misrepresenting his opponent. This may sound difficult, but it has been done before. John F. Kennedy in 1960 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 treated their rivals'  positions and records fairly, forthrightly forecast their governing approaches and hewed to the facts. With the exception of the Democratic attack on the alleged missile gap, which Kennedy may have believed existed, neither the 1960 Democratic nominee nor his Republican counterpart, Richard M. Nixon, distorted his or his opponent's plans. The Reagan campaign's attacks on President Jimmy Carter's record were also factual and fair. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as political analyst Mark Shields observed: &quot;There was nobody who was in a non-comatose state in 1980 who did not know what Ronald Reagan intended to do as president.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By comparison, the record this year is dismal. The Obama campaign misused a recent Washington Post article to label Romney as  an &quot;outsourcer in chief.&quot; And the National Republican Congressional Committee is suggesting that Obama's health-care law taxes &quot;heart attacks, sick puppies and even new babies,&quot; when instead it includes excise taxes on some medical devices. Neither candidate wants to take credit for the job losses during his first year in office, as governor or president, but blames his opponent for the losses on his watch.           Ballooning debt and a sputtering economy are making people more receptive to candid talk about what might help. Contrary to the notion that the public will never support higher income taxes or changes in social programs, polls show that a majority of Americans support removing the income limit on the Social Security taxes, increasing the taxes paid by people who make more than $250,000 a year and reducing military spending.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drumbeat of gloomy data helps clear the way for tough choices. The Congressional Budget Office has warned that there will be another recession if $8 trillion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases take effect in January. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, however, neither Obama nor Romney is being candid about the trade-offs needed to address the debt crisis. For example, Romney has said he would limit some deductions and exemptions to lower tax rates, but has not revealed which would go. And when Obama called on Congress &quot;to take the money we're no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the other half to rebuild America,&quot; he wasn't talking about money we're &quot;saving,&quot; but calling for a reallocation of money we are already borrowing.           Voters may rally behind shared sacrifice if they thought the country's future were at stake. After all, during World War II, people accepted tax increases and rationing of butter, meat and gasoline. Similarly, voters reelected most of those lawmakers who in 1983 increased Social Security taxes and the age of eligibility for the program. To make that case, Reagan argued that, without reform, Social Security was unsustainable because &quot;benefits were increased far beyond the taxes and wages that were supposed to support them.&quot; The changes to the program, he said &quot;will allow Social Security to age as gracefully as all of us hope to do ourselves, without becoming an overwhelming burden on generations still to come.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and Romney have not spoken such hard truths, but they should. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When voters are anxious about the well-being of future generations, they also are more likely to tune in to longer forms of political communication - such as debates and other televised presentations - that are conducive to honestly explaining more complex topics. For example, in 1992, an audience larger than that for a National League playoff game viewed Ross Perot's first half-hour talk about deficit reduction. And Barack Obama's half-hour televised forecast in October 2008 of his presidency drew numbers that topped those for the last game of the World Series. What 1992, 2008 and 2012 have in common is an electorate that is fearful about the future and focused on the economy. If the networks can't find a way to provide Saturday or Sunday night airtime each week, and the candidates are unwilling to shoulder the costs, perhaps the super PACs supporting them could redirect some of the money otherwise planned for attack-saturated deception.           The rewards for candor increase when the Sunday talk-show interviews and fact-checking journalists hold candidates accountable for their promises and their misleading messages. Some candidates have dialed back their claims as a result.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After The Washington Post, the Associated Press, PolitiFact, FactCheck.org (which I co-founded) and other major news organizations discredited Romney's claim to have created more than 100,000 jobs while at Bain Capital, he corrected the record, pointing out that &quot;four of the companies that we invested in - they weren't businesses I ran, but we invested in - ended up today having some 120,000 jobs. Some of the businesses we invested in weren't successful and lost jobs.&quot;When they can lure candidates into interviews, the Sunday talk-show anchors reliably tie rhetoric to reality and promise to performance. Obama has been interviewed by each of the Sunday anchors, albeit not recently. But in September 2009, ABC's George Stephanopoulos persisted while Obama denied that the individual insurance mandate in his health-care legislation   was a tax, even though, as Stephanopoulos noted, it forces &quot;people to spend money, fining you if you don't.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          &quot;How is that not a tax?&quot; Stephanopoulos asked. At issue was whether Obama had violated his 2008 campaign pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class. Recently the Supreme Court agreed with Stephanopoulos.          With similar tenacity, last month Bob Schieffer on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation&quot; asked Romney about his plan to lower income-tax rates: &quot;When are you going to tell us where you're going to get the revenue? Which of the deductions are you going to be willing to eliminate?&quot; When the candidate answered that &quot;we'll go through that process with Congress,&quot; viewers could surmise that he considered a candid answer politically costly and therefore chose to be evasive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up against the conditions that encourage honesty - dire economic news and media accountability - are messaging machines that campaigns can't directly control: super PACs and other third-party groups. From the 1988 Willie Horton ad that depicted  Democrat Michael Dukakis as soft on crime to this year's ads by super PACs, messages by outside groups are more misleading and malicious than those distributed by candidates. This year's gems included the allegation that Republican Newt Gingrich supported China's one-child policy when the legislation in question banned using the money  to fund abortions, and the charge that Romney left Massachusetts more than $1 billion in debt when he was governor. That figure was a projected shortfall that never materialized.           Broadcast stations can reject these clear-cut deceptions by insisting on accuracy, as Ohio stations did in October by declining to run a third-party ad  implying that a great-grandmother had endorsed a ballot proposition she actually opposed. Yet in a recent study I directed, only 13 percent of 260 station managers queried reported refusing to air a third-party ad in the past year.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The possibility that one candidate will substantially outspend the other (as Obama did in 2008 and Romney may do this year), and the likelihood that super PACs and other messengers will displace substance with slurs du jour, magnifies the need for the media to police deception and hold candidates accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victor's reward for treating his opponent fairly and being faithful to the facts could be a majority that trusts its president and his administration - and awards him an enhanced capacity to govern. He might even earn a place in the history books for shepherding the country through a challenging time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's a prize more enduring than four years in the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>

Result: Annual health insurance premiums have increased by $2,393. . . . Gap: health premium costs are $4,893 higher per family than President Obama promised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- New _blankFacebook/Twitter post by the Romney campaign </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Promises made during the heat of an election campaign sometimes come back to haunt politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaign of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney is trying to nail President Obama for making an iffy promise during the 2008 campaign - that premiums will be $2,500 lower under his health-care plan. Instead, the Romney campaign argues in an effort to create a viral Facebook post, the swing has gone $4,893 the other way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Romney graphic is misleading on several levels, though Obama certainly left himself open to scrutiny with imprecise language in the 2008 campaign. Let's take a look.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The Facts</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign cites a statement from _blanka 2007 speechby Obama, but it's a pledge that was repeated often: &quot;When I am president, we will have universal health care in this country by the end of my first term in office. It's a plan that will cover every American and cut the cost of a typical family's premiums by $2,500 a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This particular quote is not very clear on when the savings would be realized, but in other speeches, Obama _blanksuggested it would be at the end of his first term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details of this $2,500 figure were further explained in _blankan Obama campaign memo:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Combining all of these effects - from improved health IT [information technology], better disease management, reduced insurance overhead, reinsurance, and reduced uncompensated care - under our 'best-guess' assumptions, we estimate that businesses will save $140 billion annually in insurance premiums. The typical family will save $2,500 per year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But note that Obama's pledge came with an asterisk: He was not saying premiums would fall by that amount, as the Romney graphic asserts, but that costs would be that much lower than anticipated. In other words, if premiums were expected to rise by $5,000, they would rise only by $2,500 - that's what Obama's pledge meant, even if he was not too clear about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Dobbs, our predecessor as The Fact Checker, _blankawarded Obama Two Pinocchios for the pledge, saying it was based on shaky assumptions (such as a Rand Corp. study that was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office) and there was no guarantee that any savings would be passed on to consumers. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org also thought Obama's pledge _blankwas highly dubious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, once Obama became president, the health-care proposal he advocated as a candidate was significantly changed, even to the point of accepting the individual mandate that he had so criticized when Hillary Rodham Clinton promoted it. But the White House _blankmore or less stuck to the idea that costs would not rise as quickly as previously estimated - except that it would result in $2,000 in savings by 2019. (Recall also that the health-care law will not be fully implemented until 2014, making a first-term pledge problematic.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, let's look at what the Romney campaign has done with the pledge. First, it assumes that Obama was saying that premiums would actually decline by $2,500, rather than decline from a projected increase. Then, it takes the _blank2011 Kaiser Family Foundation survey estimate (see Exhibit 1.11) and subtracts the cost of a 2008 family premium ($12,680) from the cost of a 2011 premium ($15,073). Voila, an increase of $2,393 - and a promise gap of $4,893.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Romney campaign's math is nonsensical. First of all, the Kaiser survey is conducted from January to May each year, so starting with the 2008 date makes little sense, since that is still George W. Bush's term. Then the health-care law was not passed until 2010, so the first year in which any impact could be seen from the law was in 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, as the Kaiser report notes, most of the provisions of the new law will not take effect until 2014. Thus far, other provisions, such as providing coverage for adult children up to age 26, appear to have had a modest impact on premiums - perhaps 1 to 2 percentage points. (The White House disputes even that effect.) Still, the full effect on premiums - including any possible savings - will not be seen until the law is completely implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We had previously given the Republican National Committee _blankThree Pinocchios for an ad that had focused on the single data point - the increase in premiums from 2010 to 2011 - and blamed all of the increase on the health-care law. Now the Romney campaign has multiplied the same error in an effort to claim that &quot;health premium costs are $4,893 higher per family than President Obama promised.&quot;<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The Pinocchio Test</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama in 2008 made a foolish, dubious pledge about health-care premiums. As we have noted, he will have to answer to Americans if his law fails to live up to that promise by 2019 or if people feel misled by his lawyerly wording. He was warned when he got Two Pinocchios back in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But two wrongs don't make a right. The Romney campaign has twisted the meaning of that pledge and then blamed a partially implemented, one-year-old law for three years of premium increases, in order to concoct an absurd claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In nearly every election, voters, the news media - and the candidates themselves - clamor for more honesty from politicians. &quot;I don't know if you know to trust what either side is saying or . . .  are they just saying it to get elected?&quot; a participant told pollster Peter Hart at a recent focus-group gathering of swing voters in Colorado. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But straightforwardness doesn't make for the sexiest of stump speeches. Remember Walter Mondale's 1984 pledge to raise taxes? &quot;Let's tell the truth. . . . Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mondale lost in a landslide. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem was not that he told the truth, but that Republican ads twisted his words, alleging that, rather than using the new revenue to pay down the deficit, the Democrat would squander it on a social spending spree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So can an honest candidate, who doesn't distort his opponents' records or rhetoric, win the presidency?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes. Now more than ever, with a public highly anxious about the economy and worn down after years of promises that things would get better, the time is ripe for a candid candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win over the public honestly in 2012, a presidential aspirant would tell us things we need to hear but don't want to. Such a candidate might acknowledge that the United States will be more affected by - than have and effect on - the dramas unfolding in the Middle East and the European Union. An honest candidate would need to specify how he or she would address the more than $1 trillion budget deficit, which might include defense cuts; eliminating some of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts; taxing employer-provided health-care coverage; slowing the growth rate of Social Security and Medicare; phasing in a higher eligibility age for Social Security; eliminating the payroll-tax limit; and getting rid of the interest deduction for some home mortgages. President Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney aren't avoiding this discussion, per se, but they're not offering specific plans for how they'd address the impending crisis, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being honest doesn't stop at self-representation; a candidate should be able to secure support without misrepresenting his opponent. This may sound difficult, but it has been done before. John F. Kennedy in 1960 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 treated their rivals'  positions and records fairly, forthrightly forecast their governing approaches and hewed to the facts. With the exception of the Democratic attack on the alleged missile gap, which Kennedy may have believed existed, neither the 1960 Democratic nominee nor his Republican counterpart, Richard M. Nixon, distorted his or his opponent's plans. The Reagan campaign's attacks on President Jimmy Carter's record were also factual and fair. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as political analyst Mark Shields observed: &quot;There was nobody who was in a non-comatose state in 1980 who did not know what Ronald Reagan intended to do as president.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By comparison, the record this year is dismal. The Obama campaign misused a recent Washington Post articleto label Romney as  an &quot;outsourcer in chief.&quot; And the National Republican Congressional Committee is suggesting that Obama's health-care law taxes &quot;heart attacks, sick puppies and even new babies,&quot; when instead it includes excise taxes on some medical devices. Neither candidate wants to take credit for the job losses during his first year in office, as governor or president, but blames his opponent for the losses on his watch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ballooning debt and a sputtering economy are making people more receptive to candid talk about what might help. Contrary to the notion that the public will never support higher income taxes or changes in social programs, polls show that a majority of Americans support removing the income limit on the Social Security taxes, increasing the taxes paid by people who make more than $250,000 a year and reducing military spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drumbeat of gloomy data helps clear the way for tough choices. The Congressional Budget Office has warned that there will be another recession if $8 trillion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases take effect in January. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, however, neither Obama nor Romney is being candid about the trade-offs needed to address the debt crisis. For example, Romney has said he would limit some deductions and exemptions to lower tax rates, but has not revealed which would go. And when Obama called on Congress&quot;to take the money we're no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the other half to rebuild America,&quot; he wasn't talking about money we're &quot;saving,&quot; but calling for a reallocation of money we are already borrowing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters may rally behind shared sacrifice if they thought the country's future were at stake. After all, during World War II, people accepted tax increases and rationing of butter, meat and gasoline. Similarly, voters reelected most of those lawmakers who in 1983 increased Social Security taxes and the age of eligibility for the program. To make that case, Reagan argued that, without reform, Social Security was unsustainable because &quot;benefits were increased far beyond the taxes and wages that were supposed to support them.&quot; The changes to the program, he said &quot;will allow Social Security to age as gracefully as all of us hope to do ourselves, without becoming an overwhelming burden on generations still to come.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and Romney have not spoken such hard truths, but they should. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When voters are anxious about the well-being of future generations, they also are more likely to tune in to longer forms of political communication - such as debates and other televised presentations - that are conducive to honestly explaining more complex topics. For example, in 1992, an audience larger than that for a National League playoff game viewed Ross Perot's first half-hour talk about deficit reduction. And Barack Obama's half-hour televised forecast in October 2008 of his presidency drew numbers that topped those for the last game of the World Series. What 1992, 2008 and 2012 have in common is an electorate that is fearful about the future and focused on the economy. If the networks can't find a way to provide Saturday or Sunday night airtime each week, and the candidates are unwilling to shoulder the costs, perhaps the super PACs supporting them could redirect some of the money otherwise planned for attack-saturated deception. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rewards for candor increase when the Sunday talk-show interviews and fact-checking journalists hold candidates accountable for their promises and their misleading messages. Some candidates have dialed back their claims as a result. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After The Washington Post, the Associated Press, PolitiFact, FactCheck.org (which I co-founded) and other major news organizations discredited Romney's claim to have created more than 100,000 jobs while at Bain Capital, he corrected the record, pointing out that &quot;four of the companies that we invested in - they weren't businesses I ran, but we invested in - ended up today having some 120,000 jobs. Some of the businesses we invested in weren't successful and lost jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they can lure candidates into interviews, the Sunday talk-show anchors reliably tie rhetoric to reality and promise to performance. Obama has been interviewed by each of the Sunday anchors, albeit not recently. But in September 2009, ABC's George Stephanopoulos persistedwhile Obama denied that the individual insurance mandate in his health-care legislation   was a tax, even though, as Stephanopoulos noted, it forces &quot;people to spend money, fining you if you don't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How is that not a tax?&quot; Stephanopoulos asked. At issue was whether Obama had violated his 2008 campaign pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class. Recently the Supreme Court agreed with Stephanopoulos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With similar tenacity, last month Bob Schieffer on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation&quot; asked Romney about his plan to lower income-tax rates: &quot;When are you going to tell us where you're going to get the revenue? Which of the deductions are you going to be willing to eliminate?&quot; When the candidate answered that &quot;we'll go through that process with Congress,&quot; viewers could surmise that he considered a candid answer politically costly and therefore chose to be evasive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up against the conditions that encourage honesty - dire economic news and media accountability - are messaging machines that campaigns can't directly control: super PACs and other third-party groups. From the 1988 Willie Horton ad that depicted  Democrat Michael Dukakis as soft on crime to this year's ads by super PACs, messages by outside groups are more misleading and malicious than those distributed by candidates. This year's gems included the allegation that Republican Newt Gingrich supported China's one-child policy when the legislation in question banned using the money  to fund abortions, and the charge that Romney left Massachusetts more than $1 billion in debt when he was governor. That figure was a projected shortfall that never materialized. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broadcast stations can reject these clear-cut deceptions by insisting on accuracy, as Ohio stations did in October by declining to run a third-party ad  implying that a great-grandmother had endorsed a ballot proposition she actually opposed. Yet in a recent study I directed, only 13 percent of 260 station managers queried reported refusing to air a third-party ad in the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The possibility that one candidate will substantially outspend the other (as Obama did in 2008 and Romney may do this year), and the likelihood that super PACs and other messengers will displace substance with slurs du jour, magnifies the need for the media to police deception and hold candidates accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victor's reward for treating his opponent fairly and being faithful to the facts could be a majority that trusts its president and his administration - and awards him an enhanced capacity to govern. He might even earn a place in the history books for shepherding the country through a challenging time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's a prize more enduring than four years in the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- For much of the past year, Republicans assailed President Obama for resisting the Medicare spending reductions they say are needed to both preserve health benefits for older Americans and avert a Greek-style debt crisis. Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House Republicans' point man on the budget, has called the president ''gutless.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet since the Supreme Court upheld the Democrats' 2010 health care law, Republicans, led by Mitt Romney, have reversed tactics and attacked the president and Democrats in Congress by saying that Medicare will be cut too much as part of that law. Republicans plan to hold another vote to repeal the law in the House next week, though any such measure would die in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Obamacare cuts Medicare -- cuts Medicare -- by approximately $500 billion,'' Mr. Romney has told audiences. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is a reprise of Republicans' mantra of the 2010 midterm elections, which gave them big gains at both the state and federal levels and a majority in the House. Yet the message conflicts not only with their past complaint that Democrats opposed reining in Medicare spending, but also with the fact that House Republicans have voted twice since 2010 for the same 10-year, $500 billion savings in supporting Mr. Ryan's annual budgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is a messaging mess, even by the standards of each party's usual election-year attacks that the other is being insufficiently supportive of older people's benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in this year's contests, which both parties describe as a referendum on who can best correct the nation's economic course, such talk underscores how far Republicans and Democrats are from truly squaring with the public about curbing the growth of the major entitlement programs: Medicare, Medicaid and, to a lesser extent, Social Security. That growth is driving the projections of a federal debt that is mounting unsustainably as the population ages and health care costs rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''A pox on both their houses,'' said Ron Haskins, a former Congressional staff member who is now a scholar of social programs and budgeting at the Brookings Institution. Democrats and Republicans ''know they have to do something about Medicare, and then they harass each other about cutting Medicare. It's so discouraging to me, but I'm a Republican, so I'm much more distraught about Republicans.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, Mr. Haskins added, ''$500 billion is modest compared to what Ryan would do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Mr. Ryan's budget, which Mr. Romney has supported but which has been blocked each year in the Senate, Medicare would not pay for the medical fees of future beneficiaries, as it currently does. Instead it would provide ''premium support,'' limited payments -- vouchers, Democrats say -- that beneficiaries could use to buy insurance policies in the private sector. And Medicaid, which increasingly goes toward nursing home care for older people, would become a capped block grant to states, forcing them to make significant cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their attacks, Republicans have said in speeches and in television advertisements that the Democrats' projected $500 billion in Medicare savings will ''strip,'' ''gut,'' ''rob'' or ''raid'' older people's benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Ron Barber will hurt Arizona seniors,'' said an ad this spring from the House Republicans' campaign committee in support of the Republican who ultimately lost to Mr. Barber, a Democrat, in a special election to replace Representative Gabrielle Giffords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Objecting to such attacks, Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said in an interview: ''There are two issues here: One, there were no cuts to Medicare benefits. And in fact, benefits were strengthened.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent fact-checking groups have repeatedly knocked down the Republicans' claims. ''A discredited claim is making a comeback following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding most of the national health care reform law,'' PolitiFact recently wrote in one such analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans stand by their attack. They say the problem with the Democratic approach is that the reductions do little to bolster Medicare's stability, with the money diverted to initiatives in the health care law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Democrats are still the only party in Washington to cut $500 billion from Medicare in order to help pay for Obamacare,'' said Paul Lindsay, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. ''It's a fact that did not go unnoticed among seniors in 2010, and one that we will continue holding Democrats accountable for in our ads this fall.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the $500 billion in reductions would come through cuts in the projected growth of Medicare and would mainly affect hospitals and other providers of medical care, some of whom supported the health care measure nonetheless because it would extend coverage to up to 30 million uninsured Americans, raising the number of paying customers. Other savings would result from lower subsidies for private insurers selling Medicare Advantage plans, which offer older people extra features like vision care and gym memberships. The insurers could not cut basic Medicare benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats used the projected $500 billion in savings to help pay for expanding older people's benefits. The health care law says that some preventive care services like mammograms must be free to patients, and it closed the ''doughnut hole'' in the Medicare prescription drug program, which had left many older people paying full price for prescriptions above a certain level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Republicans have backed the spending reductions, even as they have attacked Mr. Obama and the Democrats for enacting them, they would end the new benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ryan, of Wisconsin, was unavailable for comment, but, pressed on the issue on ABC's ''This Week'' on Sunday, he said: ''Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Greenstein, the executive director of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, called Mr. Ryan's claim ''somewhere between a misstatement and a flat-out untruth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Greenstein, among others, said that Democrats were not double-counting the $500 billion in savings -- by claiming that it both improves Medicare's financial outlook and helps finance new benefits -- any more than were the Republicans, who say they would use the savings both to shore up the Medicare trust funds and to reduce the federal debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congressional Budget Office and the chief actuary for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, Richard S. Foster, have concluded that the $500 billion in savings would extend the solvency of Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund. Since the passage of the health care law, known as the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare trustees have shifted the projected date of insolvency to 2024 from 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Foster, in this year's report by the trustees, wrote that ''the Affordable Care Act makes important changes to the Medicare program and substantially improves its financial outlook.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be no summer idyll for voters in swing states, who will be deluged with tens of millions of dollars in political ads over the next month as part of an intensifying broadcast war through the Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to spots from President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney, many ads will be aired by independent nonprofit groups that are not required to reveal who is funding them. The surge comes ahead of a legal deadline that could force some groups to begin identifying their donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crossroads GPS, a conservative nonprofit group co-founded by former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove, announced Friday that it was purchasing $25 million worth of anti-Obama ads in swing states. The ads will be pegged to June's disappointing unemployment report. The campaign starts Tuesday and will run through early August in nine swing states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio and Virginia.          &quot;Barack Obama's got lots of excuses for the bad economy,&quot; a narrator says in the Crossroads ad. &quot;But Obama never blames Washington's wild spending and skyrocketing debt.&quot;            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Crossroads buy is part of a blizzard of ad spending planned by the presidential campaigns and their allies over the next month, most of it concentrated in about a dozen battleground states that are expected to hold the key to the election in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has reserved about $25 million worth of television and radio spots in July, continuing the heavy pace it began in May, according to advertising trackers. Those ads come on top of a steady stream of spots from Democratic allies, including the Priorities USA Action super PAC, which has spent weeks hammering on Romney's career as a corporate buyout specialist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign has not announced its full plans for July but has been spending about $750,000 a day on average so far this month. One recent spot features footage of Hillary Rodham Clinton, now secretary of state, criticizing Obama during the fierce 2008 Democratic primary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are the Olympic Games, broadcast from London beginning July 27, which have attracted at least $13 million so far in connection with the presidential race. Obama has bought about $5.5 million worth of airtime on U.S. networks, while Restore Our Future, a pro-Romney super PAC, says it will spend $7.2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When all is said and done, the two presidential candidates, their parties and independent groups could spend $100 million or more on advertising over the next month, nearly all of it trained on a narrow group of swing states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Goldstein, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks ad spending, said the volume of political ads is unusually high for summertime, which has traditionally marked a lull before the party conventions in a presidential election year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's incredibly intense and incredibly concentrated. There does not appear to be much ebbing and flowing that's going to go on for the next couple months,&quot; Goldstein said. &quot;There's lots of players, there's lots of money and you have a competitive election. It's a perfect storm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the ad spending related to the presidential race comes in the form of &quot;issue ads&quot; from conservative groups like Crossroads GPS or Americans for Prosperity, which are organized as tax-exempt &quot;social welfare&quot; organizations that do not have to disclose their donors. Issue ads do not specifically advocate voting for or against a candidate, although most average viewers would be hard-pressed to tell the difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a federal judge ruled earlier this year that such groups would have to reveal some or all of their donors if they run issue ads before the conventions or general election - a clock that starts ticking in early August. Campaign-finance experts say the disclosure deadline could help explain part of the surge in July advertising, although several advocacy groups said they were still assessing the ruling and had not factored it into their decisions. Some of the groups could end up following the lead of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has said it will evade the ruling by abandoning issue ads in favor of spots directly endorsing or opposing congressional candidates. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             POLAND, Ohio - Campaigning across Ohio on Thursday, President Obama walked a line between talk of economic optimism and expressions of economic realism. On Friday, reality hit home with a vengeance as the latest jobs report showed the economy added just 80,000 jobs in June and that the unemployment rate was unchanged at 8.2 percent.          A month ago, the nation's May jobs report was a shocker, not just because the number of new jobs added - 69,000 - was so dismal but also because it was far below forecasts. Friday's report was less surprising - it fell well within the bounds of predictions - but it may have carried as much or more weight politically for the president because it fell in with a months-long trend of weak economic growth.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's political team has played down the significance of the Labor Department's monthly reports and did so again on Friday. They contend that Americans are not, and should not be, fixated on the current unemployment rate or monthly statistics. Instead, they say that Americans will take their clues on the economy from whether a friend or neighbor has recently found work or on whether the outlook is brighter in their communities.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that calculus, the direction of the economy and voters' perceptions count more than actual unemployment levels or one month's statistics. And so, as it has done regularly, Obama's team chose to note that the economy added jobs for the 28th straight month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the jobless rate has been above 8 percent for 41 consecutive months. And that is what Republican challenger Mitt Romney emphasized in his response. Any upward movement in the economy will be good for Obama, but the halting recovery of this summer is hardly grounds for a &quot;Morning in America&quot; ad blitz in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's message on his two-day bus tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania has been twofold. First, he pointed to modest signs of progress in rebuilding the economy - the health of the auto industry is his principal case study across Ohio's northern tier. At the same time, he warned that the medicine offered by Romney and the Republicans is exactly the wrong prescription. As he said here Friday morning, &quot;We tried it, and didn't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it has become increasingly difficult for Obama to argue that what he has tried is working well, or that he has something new to offer. Each month that the economy produces fewer jobs than are needed just to keep pace with population growth adds to the burden the president faces as the clock ticks toward November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quick turnaround doesn't appear likely, given recent analyses. The Federal Reserve's latest assessment projecting slower growth than previously forecast bodes ill for the incumbent. The tenuous situation in Europe threatens to cause more problems here at home, with Obama's leverage limited. Manufacturing, which had been a relatively bright spot, doesn't look quite as good now, based on recent reports. Other issues come and go in the campaign, some more significant than others. Health care is the latest to reemerge. The president has spent the week talking about the Supreme Court's decision upholding the constitutionality of his health-care law. Obama may be prepared to work with others to improve the law, as he said repeatedly this week. But his basic message is one of defiance: &quot;The law I passed is here to stay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama barely mentioned the latest jobs report in his first appearance after it was released. &quot;It's still tough out there,&quot; he said. But June's hiring numbers, like those for May, were another reminder that there is still no bigger issue in the campaign than the economy and that its weight threatens to defeat the president four months from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His advisers offered two thoughts about the latest numbers: first, that the bad news was expected, seemingly a sign that they were resigned to a negative reaction; second, that the public still gives the president some slack because of the economy he inherited and that the campaign still offers him the chance to make the case that he would do more than Romney to help the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama makes that case with vigor and some edge. He told audiences the past two days that he sees the lives and aspirations of families across America in the experiences of his own family - his mother, his grandparents and wife Michelle's family. He showed the edge when he focused on the policies of Romney and other Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's calculation is obviously different: By November, voters will have concluded that, however well intentioned Obama may be, and however much he inherited that wasn't his fault, he isn't up to the job. As Romney put it Friday, &quot;It doesn't have to be this way. America can do better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has four more Friday jobs reports before November. If each one turns out like the last three, the president's road to reelection will become more difficult by the month.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney is betraying his calling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He brings to the presidential race a record of accomplishment to which few White House contenders can lay claim: W. Mitt Romney knows how to make money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some may argue that a money-making ability alone is no qualification to be president. I agree that having a high net worth is insufficient reason to be declared presidential timber. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But attaining a personal fortune of as much as $250 million, as Romney has done - and not through inheritance or grand theft - is a testament to creative abilities, a strong work ethic, a focused mind and keen understanding of the economic environment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, however, is blowing it by seeking to appeal to the average voter by selling himself as something he's not. He also is running away from the opportunity to show voters that he, above all other candidates, knows how Americans can reap a better return on the investments they are making of time, energy and talent in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the record, and as regular readers of this column know, I regard the political and moral priorities of the current White House occupant to be more in tune with my own. That said, Romney, by reason of experience, has a legitimate claim on the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year ago, I said on the TV program &quot;Inside Washington&quot; that Romney understands how the economy works and that he should use the campaign to explain the private sector's critical role. That point didn't go down well with some of my liberal friends. Maybe it's because I was wearing my banker's hat at the time. Ten years as a commercial banker and bank director were more than enough time to convince me that a thriving business sector is key to economic growth and expanding opportunity. Romney, I believed last year, was well suited to make that case.          Instead, he has made a mess of it, misrepresenting his history and shying away from the truth, apparently out of fear that by sticking up for the country's privately owned enterprises he will be portrayed as a heartless, money-grubbing capitalist and scourge of the poor. Of course, in this political climate, that might happen anyway. Still, there's no reason to dissemble.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the only way to describe Romney's suggestion that job creation was the motivating force behind his work in the private sector. Beyond the question of whether Romney created 100,000 jobs  - as he has claimed - is his implicit buy-in to the argument that the private sector's purpose is to produce jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney knows better, even if his critics don't. The private sector operates to make profits, not jobs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, a majority of Americans work in the private sector. But General Motors, Giant Food, the TV networks and others don't exist to employ Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Motors sells cars, Giant sells food and the networks sell entertainment to make a profit for their owners and investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without question, a payroll is a necessary ingredient in building and selling vehicles, groceries and entertainment. But owners, regardless of industries, are obligated to control costs. The fewer workers they employ, the better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney portraying himself as an entrepreneur who altruistically created employment opportunities not only is incorrect but also conveys a false picture of free enterprise. That, in turn, skews public understanding of what the private sector can and can't do; creating a more equitable and just society is one of the things businesses don't set out to do. Romney seems ashamed of touting financial performance as an essential factor in economic growth, choosing instead to come across as a one-man hiring hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pander is apparent in other ways. Take the Obama campaign's charge that the private equity firm co-founded by Romney, Bain Capital, &quot;invested in companies that moved jobs overseas.&quot; The Romney camp responds by touting the former governor's &quot;record of job creation in the private sector.&quot;          What clumsiness, if not cowardice.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is nothing wrong with a company legally outsourcing jobs domestically or even sending jobs offshore if the effort allows the company to reduce its costs and operate more economically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this globalized economy, America must adjust to competitive forces. Certainly there are costs and downsides that come with outsourcing and offshoring jobs. That is not at issue. Change is constant. Workforce adjustments must be made. Government has a role to play. But adapting to competition at home and abroad is mandatory if we are to survive economically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, more than most, knows better, and he won't touch this reality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He betrays his calling because he's willing to say - and be - all things to become president.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be no summer idyll for voters in swing states, who will be deluged with tens of millions of dollars in political ads over the next month as part of an intensifying broadcast war through the Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to spots from President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney, many ads will be aired by independent nonprofit groups that are not required to reveal who is funding them. The surge comes ahead of a legal deadline that could force some groups to begin identifying their donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crossroads GPS, a conservative nonprofit group co-founded by former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove, announced Friday that it was purchasing $25 million worth of anti-Obama ads in swing states. The ads will be pegged to June's disappointing unemployment report. The campaign starts Tuesday and will run through early August in nine swing states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio and Virginia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama's got lots of excuses for the bad economy,&quot; a narrator says in the Crossroads ad. &quot;But Obama never blames Washington's wild spending and skyrocketing debt.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Crossroads buy is part of a blizzard of ad spending planned by the presidential campaigns and their allies over the next month, most of it concentrated in about a dozen battleground states that are expected to hold the key to the election in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has reserved about $25 million worth of television and radio spots in July, continuing the heavy pace it began in May, according to advertising trackers. Those ads come on top of a steady stream of spots from Democratic allies, including the Priorities USA Action super PAC, which has spent weeks hammering on Romney's career as a corporate buyout specialist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign has not announced its full plans for July but has been spending about $750,000 a day on average so far this month. Onerecent spotfeatures footage of Hillary Rodham Clinton, now secretary of state, criticizing Obama during the fierce 2008 Democratic primary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are the Olympic Games, broadcast from London beginning July 27, which have attracted at least $13 million so far in connection with the presidential race. Obama has bought about $5.5 million worth of airtime on U.S. networks, while Restore Our Future, a pro-Romney super PAC, says it will spend $7.2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When all is said and done, the two presidential candidates, their parties and independent groups could spend $100 million or more on advertising over the next month, nearly all of it trained on a narrow group of swing states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Goldstein, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks ad spending, said the volume of political ads is unusually high for summertime, which has traditionally marked a lull before the party conventions in a presidential election year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's incredibly intense and incredibly concentrated. There does not appear to be much ebbing and flowing that's going to go on for the next couple months,&quot; Goldstein said. &quot;There's lots of players, there's lots of money and you have a competitive election. It's a perfect storm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the ad spending related to the presidential race comes in the form of &quot;issue ads&quot; from conservative groups like Crossroads GPS or Americans for Prosperity, which are organized as tax-exempt &quot;social welfare&quot; organizations that do not have to disclose their donors. Issue ads do not specifically advocate voting for or against a candidate, although most average viewers would be hard-pressed to tell the difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a federal judgeruled earlier this year that such groups would have to reveal some or all of their donors if they run issue ads before the conventions or general election - a clock that starts ticking in early August. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign-finance experts say the disclosure deadline could help explain part of the surge in July advertising, although several advocacy groups said they were still assessing the ruling and had not factored it into their decisions. Some of the groups could end up following the lead of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has said it will evade the rulingby abandoning issue ads in favor of spots directly endorsing or opposing congressional candidates. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney is betraying his calling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He brings to the presidential race a record of accomplishment to which few White House contenders can lay claim: W. Mitt Romney knows how to make money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some may argue that a money-making ability alone is no qualification to be president. I agree that having a high net worth is insufficient reason to be declared presidential timber. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But attaining a personal fortune of as much as $250 million, as Romney has done - and not through inheritance or grand theft - is a testament to creative abilities, a strong work ethic, a focused mind and keen understanding of the economic environment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, however, is blowing it by seeking to appeal to the average voter by selling himself as something he's not. He also is running away from the opportunity to show voters that he, above all other candidates, knows how Americans can reap a better return on the investments they are making of time, energy and talent in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the record, and as regular readers of this column know, I regard the political and moral priorities of the current White House occupant to be more in tune with my own. That said, Romney, by reason of experience, has a legitimate claim on the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year ago, I said on the TV program &quot;Inside Washington&quot; that Romney understands how the economy works and that he should use the campaign to explain the private sector's critical role. That point didn't go down well with some of my liberal friends. Maybe it's because I was wearing my banker's hat at the time. Ten years as a commercial banker and bank director were more than enough time to convince me that a thriving business sector is key to economic growth and expanding opportunity. Romney, I believed last year, was well suited to make that case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he has made a mess of it, misrepresenting his history and shying away from the truth, apparently out of fear that by sticking up for the country's privately owned enterprises he will be portrayed as a heartless, money-grubbing capitalist and scourge of the poor. Of course, in this political climate, that might happen anyway. Still, there's no reason to dissemble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the only way to describe Romney's suggestion that job creation was the motivating force behind his work in the private sector. Beyond the question of whether Romney created 100,000 jobs- as he has claimed - is his implicit buy-in to the argument that the private sector's purpose is to produce jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney knows better, even if his critics don't. The private sector operates to make profits, not jobs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, a majority of Americans work in the private sector. But General Motors, Giant Food, the TV networks and others don't exist to employ Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Motors sells cars, Giant sells food and the networks sell entertainment to make a profit for their owners and investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without question, a payroll is a necessary ingredient in building and selling vehicles, groceries and entertainment. But owners, regardless of industries, are obligated to control costs. The fewer workers they employ, the better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney portraying himself as an entrepreneur who altruistically created employment opportunities not only is incorrect but also conveys a false picture of free enterprise. That, in turn, skews public understanding of what the private sector can and can't do; creating a more equitable and just society is one of the things businesses don't set out to do. Romney seems ashamed of touting financial performance as an essential factor in economic growth, choosing instead to come across as a one-man hiring hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pander is apparent in other ways. Take the Obama campaign's charge that the private equity firm co-founded by Romney, Bain Capital, &quot;invested in companies that moved jobs overseas.&quot; The Romney camp responds by touting the former governor's &quot;record of job creation in the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What clumsiness, if not cowardice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is nothing wrong with a company legally outsourcing jobs domestically or even sending jobs offshore if the effort allows the company to reduce its costs and operate more economically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this globalized economy, America must adjust to competitive forces. Certainly there are costs and downsides that come with outsourcing and offshoring jobs. That is not at issue. Change is constant. Workforce adjustments must be made. Government has a role to play. But adapting to competition at home and abroad is mandatory if we are to survive economically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, more than most, knows better, and he won't touch this reality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He betrays his calling because he's willing to say - and be - all things to become president.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLAND, OHIO</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLAND, Ohio - Campaigning across Ohio on Thursday, President Obama walked a line between talk of economic optimism and expressions of economic realism. On Friday, reality hit home with a vengeance as the latest jobs report showed theeconomy added just 80,000 jobs in June and that the unemployment rate was unchanged at 8.2 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month ago, the nation's May jobs report was a shocker, not just because the number of new jobs added - 69,000 - was so dismal but also because it was far below forecasts. Friday's report was less surprising - it fell well within the bounds of predictions - but it may have carried as much or more weight politically for the president because it fell in with a months-long trend of weak economic growth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's political team has played down the significance of the Labor Department's monthly reports and did so again on Friday. They contend that Americans are not, and should not be, fixated on the current unemployment rate or monthly statistics. Instead, they say that Americans will take their clues on the economy from whether a friend or neighbor has recently found work or on whether the outlook is brighter in their communities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that calculus, the direction of the economy and voters' perceptions count more than actual unemployment levels or one month's statistics. And so, as it has done regularly, Obama's team chose to note that the economy added jobs for the 28th straight month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the jobless rate has been above 8 percent for 41 consecutive months. And that is what Republican challenger Mitt Romney emphasized in his response. Any upward movement in the economy will be good for Obama, but the halting recovery of this summer is hardly grounds for a &quot;Morning in America&quot; ad blitz in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's message on his two-day bus tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania has been twofold. First, he pointed to modest signs of progress in rebuilding the economy - the health of the auto industry is his principal case study across Ohio's northern tier. At the same time, he warned that the medicine offered by Romney and the Republicans is exactly the wrong prescription. As he said here Friday morning, &quot;We tried it, and didn't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it has become increasingly difficult for Obama to argue that what he has tried is working well, or that he has something new to offer. Each month that the economy produces fewer jobs than are needed just to keep pace with population growth adds to the burden the president faces as the clock ticks toward November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quick turnaround doesn't appear likely, given recent analyses. The Federal Reserve's latest assessment projecting slower growth than previously forecast bodes ill for the incumbent. The tenuous situation in Europethreatens to cause more problems here at home, with Obama's leverage limited. Manufacturing, which had been a relatively bright spot, doesn't look quite as good now, based on recent reports. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other issues come and go in the campaign, some more significant than others. Health care is the latest to reemerge. The president has spent the week talking about the Supreme Court's decision upholding the constitutionality of his health-care law. Obama may be prepared to work with others to improve the law, as he said repeatedly this week. But his basic message is one of defiance: &quot;The law I passed is here to stay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama barely mentioned the latest jobs report in his first appearance after it was released. &quot;It's still tough out there,&quot; he said. But June's hiring numbers, like those for May, were another reminder that there is still no bigger issue in the campaign than the economy and that its weight threatens to defeat the president four months from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His advisers offered two thoughts about the latest numbers: first, that the bad news was expected, seemingly a sign that they were resigned to a negative reaction; second, that the public still gives the president some slack because of the economy he inherited and that the campaign still offers him the chance to make the case that he would do more than Romney to help the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama makes that case with vigor and some edge. He told audiences the past two days that he sees the lives and aspirations of families across America in the experiences of his own family - his mother, his grandparents and wife Michelle's family. He showed the edge when he focused on the policies of Romney and other Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's calculation is obviously different: By November, voters will have concluded that, however well intentioned Obama may be, and however much he inherited that wasn't his fault, he isn't up to the job. As Romney put it Friday, &quot;It doesn't have to be this way. America can do better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has four more Friday jobs reports before November. If each one turns out like the last three, the president's road to reelection will become more difficult by the month.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Kevin Madden, a communications expert with long ties to Mitt Romney, will become a more frequent and visible spokesman for the presidential campaign. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Madden, a Republican communications expert with long ties to Mitt Romney, will become a more frequent and visible spokesman for the presidential campaign, a source close to the decision said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increased responsibilities for Mr. Madden came in the wake of criticism from nervous Republicans about Mr. Romney's campaign team. The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial that the campaign &quot;looks confused in addition to being politically dumb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the source familiar with Mr. Madden's new role stressed that it is part of a broader effort to respond to the increasing demands of the traveling press corps as the presidential campaign heads toward the national convention later this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Madden was Mr. Romney's press secretary during the 2008 campaign, appearing frequently on television and serving as the primary foil for the cadre of national political reporters following the candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he did not reprise that role during the Republican primaries, remaining as an unpaid adviser. As Mr. Romney clinched the Republican nomination, Mr. Madden joined the campaign officially, but has served a less visible role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is likely to change now as Mr. Madden will travel more frequently with Mr. Romney in the coming weeks.  He will also appear on television as a public face of the campaign during the daily engagements with President Obama's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Madden did not respond to requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shift comes after Eric Fehrnstrom, one of Mr. Romney's senior advisers, created angst among Republican leaders on Capitol Hill last week by saying that Mr. Romney disagreed with them on whether Mr. Obama's health care mandate is a tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several days later, Mr. Romney contradicted Mr. Fehrnstrom, telling CBS News that he agreed with his Republican colleagues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the second time that Mr. Fehrnstrom, who served as press secretary for Mr. Romney during his time as governor of Massachusetts, has drawn criticism for his public statements. In March, Mr. Fehrnstrom said the approaching general election campaign was an &quot;Etch A Sketch&quot; moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That created a political mess for Mr. Romney for days as Democrats seized on the comment as evidence of what they said was Mr. Romney's tendency to flip-flop on issues.</SPAN></P>

Thank goodness, too, or our tightly scripted politics would be even more devoid of humanity and our elections even more in thrall to those scary voices in the ads.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But was Ann Romney's over-the-top assertion that Obama's campaign strategy can be summed up in two words - &quot;kill Romney'' - even an oopsie? I don't think so, because later in the same joint CBS interview with her husband, she interrupted him to repeat herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the president's suggestion that Romney lacks compassion, she said: &quot;It makes you realize they're going to do everything they can to destroy Mitt. . . . I feel like all [Obama's] doing is saying, 'Let's kill this guy.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goodness, madam, didn't we agree to demilitarize the language of politics after Gabby Giffords was shot last year? I don't think that Ann Romney was being intentionally incendiary so much as gleefully clueless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the very real safety concerns every president faces,  Ann Romney's words make her seem more cosseted - protected, seemingly, from the worries Michelle Obama has to deal with in that regard - than Democrats have portrayed her to be. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although nothing is more natural than taking criticism of one's mate to heart, has she so soon forgotten her guy's own take-no-prisoners handling of his fellow Republicans during the primary season?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's this: So far, nothing the president has said about Mitt matches the meanness of his fellow Republican Newt Gingrich's Florida robo-calls accusing Romney of denying kosher food to Holocaust survivors in nursing homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worst Obama's said about his rival, in the ad that pegged him as a &quot;vampire capitalist&quot; - was on a par with, and inspired by, Rick Perry calling him a &quot;vulture capitalist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney hasn't been shy about criticizing the president, either, of course. For instance, saying that Obama &quot;almost sounded like he's more frightened that Israel might take military action than he's concerned that Iran might become nuclear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question about her response to criticism couldn't have caught Ann Romney off-guard. In fact, I doubt she has ever given an interview in which she </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">wasn't</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asked how she deals with &quot;attacks&quot; on Mitt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two most predictable questions for aspiring first ladies are these: What worthy cause will you make your own?

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney, who is planning to travel to Israel and London this summer, is now also considering stops in Germany and Poland, according to a report in Politico. If he were to go through with those plans, it would create an itinerary that would seem intended to highlight places where Mr. Romney feels he can draw substantive distinctions going forward with President Obama on foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That has been a struggle for Mr. Romney on some key issues, such as when to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan. Foreign policy has taken a back seat in this election to debates over domestic economic problems. And while national security is often the strong electoral hand of the G.O.P. candidate, Mr. Obama has polled well on those issues, leaving his challenger less space to stake out a different course.  But some analysts say Mr. Romney still needs to do a better job articulating how his foreign policy would tangibly differ from the current White House approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney officials declined comment on the trip, but people inside the campaign had been discussing a plan to travel to Germany to meet with the chancellor, Angela Merkel, after Mr. Romney stops in London for the Olympics. According to people close to the campaign, such a trip, if it ultimately happens, would give Mr. Romney an opportunity to discuss the European economic crisis with Ms. Merkel, who backs an austerity program that includes government spending cuts to resolve Europe's debt crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration has been critical of such austerity plans and public spending cuts at a time when spending by consumers and businesses is depressed, favoring instead policies designed to spur growth to get European economies back on track. Mr. Obama's approach in Europe has in turn drawn fire from one of Mr. Romney's top economic advisers, suggesting how the two parties may have the same sort of austerity-versus-stimulus argument this fall over Europe as they will over United States fiscal policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign is also debating stopping in Poland, according to Politico. A visit there would give Mr. Romney an opportunity to hammer Mr. Obama for his decision three years ago to scrap a George W. Bush-era proposed antiballistic missile shield in Eastern Europe, and create instead a system to shoot down short- and medium-range Iranian missiles. White House officials have said their shield would better protect United States allies, but Mr. Romney says Mr. Obama killed an important program with no concessions from Russia.</SPAN></P>

The law's individual mandate, which imposes a fine on those who do not obtain health insurance, is a tax, the court ruled, and is therefore constitutional under Congress's power to assess taxes. On Monday, senior Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom said the former Massachusetts governor rejected the court's characterization and believed that the individual mandate was a penalty, not a tax. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Romney's comments on Wednesday opened him up to renewed criticism from Democrats that he had changed positions for political expediency, campaign spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg maintained that his remarks &quot;were in line&quot; with what Fehrnstrom said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney said he disagrees with the court's ruling, and aides said he still thinks the individual mandate is an &quot;unconstitutional penalty,&quot; but he said he accepts that the court's majority opinion is now the law of the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court has the final word, and their final word is that Obamacare is a tax,&quot; Romney told CBS. &quot;So it's a tax. They decided it was constitutional. So it is a tax, and it's constitutional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, Romney said: &quot;While I agreed with the dissent, that's taken over by the fact that the majority of the court said it's a tax, and therefore it is a tax. They have spoken. There is no way around that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health-care reform has been a difficult issue for Romney, given the many similarities between the Massachusetts legislation he championed and signed as governor and the federal law that has become one of the most inflammatory issues for conservative voters. The Supreme Court's ruling made the matter even trickier for Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By saying the mandate is a tax, Romney seemed to acknowledge that the provision in the Massachusetts law that, like Obama's federal law, fines people who don't buy health coverage also is a tax. But he argued that is not the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had Romney not called the federal mandate a tax, he would have been at odds with most other Republican leaders in the country, who have seized on last week's ruling to open a fresh line of attack against Obama and the legislation they call &quot;Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the CBS interview, Romney signaled that he would campaign on the Supreme Court ruling and he began to brand Obama as imposing new taxes on the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They concluded it was a tax, that's what it is, and the American people know that President Obama has broken the pledge he made. He said he wouldn't raise taxes on middle-income Americans,&quot; the Republican said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's comments Wednesday interrupted what seemed like a perfectly scripted Fourth of July for the candidate, who emerged for the first time from his family vacation at his lakefront compound in Wolfeboro to march in the town's annual parade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt and Ann Romney, their five sons and many of their 18 grandchildren walked along Main Street, shaking hands, waving American flags and gulping lemonade as a camera crew shot footage for commercials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All year on the campaign trail, Romney has vowed to lead the effort to repeal Obama's health-care law, and he argued after the court ruling that the only way to do so is to elect a new president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his CBS interview, Romney offered reasoning that may prove difficult for many voters to follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When correspondent Jan Crawford asked whether his Massachusetts law also is a tax, he said: &quot;The chief justice in his opinion made it very clear that at the state level, states have the power to put in place mandates. They don't need to require them to be called 'taxes' in order for them to be constitutional. And as a result, Massachusetts' mandate was a mandate, was a penalty, was described that way by the legislature and by me, and so it stays as it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since his opponents in the 2008 GOP presidential primaries branded him a flip-flopper, Romney has gone to great lengths to try to avoid that label in this campaign. But Obama's reelection campaign officials saw in Romney's comments Wednesday an opening, and they rushed out a statement saying that the Republican had &quot;contradicted his own campaign, and himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, he threw his top aide Eric Fehrnstrom under the bus by changing his campaign's position and calling the free rider penalty in the President's health care law - which requires those who can afford it to buy insurance - a tax,&quot; Obama campaign spokesman Danny Kanner said. &quot;Second, he contradicted himself by saying his own Massachusetts mandate wasn't a tax - but, Romney has called the individual mandate he implemented in Massachusetts a tax many times before. Glad we cleared all that up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican strategists said the public debate over whether the mandate is a penalty or a tax will mean little to voters in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it means absolutely nothing or less than nothing,&quot; said Alex Castellanos, a top adviser to Romney in 2008 who is no longer affiliated with him. &quot;Whether it's a tax or a mandate, that's not what people are going to look at to try and find a difference between these two candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greg Mueller, an adviser to conservative groups, said, &quot;Whatever he wants to call it is one thing,&quot; adding: &quot;At the end of the day, Romney's going to be the candidate ready to repeal - branch and root - Obamacare and stop this massive tax increase, and Obama's going to be the guy defending it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's campaign on Tuesday intensified its attacks on Mitt Romney for outsourcing jobs, releasing a new TV ad that accuses the former Massachusetts governor's old private equity firm of shipping jobs to low-wage countries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent fact-checking groups have criticized Mr. Obama's previous ads on the issue, saying there is scant evidence for the claim that Mr. Romney's companies shut down operations in the United States while opening new facilities in other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Factcheck.orgconcluded last week that ''we found no evidence to support the claim that Romney - while he was still running Bain Capital - shipped American jobs overseas.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is no indication that Mr. Obama plans to let up. In a letter to Factcheck.org released on Sunday, Stephanie Cutter, the deputy campaign manager for Mr. Obama, challenged a key premise of the group's analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You state that, 'there's no evidence that he took any active role in Bain's decisions after he left in February 1999,''' Ms. Cutter wrote. ''This is simply incorrect.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's latest ad, entitled ''Believe,'' will run in nine battleground states, the campaign said in a release Tuesday morning. They are Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad's narrator says that ''Mitt Romney's companies were pioneers in outsourcing U.S. jobs to low-wage countries,'' showing an image of a recent Washington Post article on the subject. (Mr. Romney's campaign has complained that the story was ''100 percent wrong'' but the Post has stood firm.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad explicitly compares Mr. Romney to Mr. Obama, saying that the Republican ''supports tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas,'' while Mr. Obama ''believes in insourcing'' and ''fought to save the U.S. auto industry.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amanda Henneberg, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, accused Mr. Obama's campaign of trying to mislead voters by using claims that have been disproved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are happy to put Governor Romney's record of job creation in the private sector, and as governor, up against President Obama's any day,'' Ms. Henneberg said. ''Spending millions of dollars on untrue ads won't change the fact that President Obama's policies have left more than 23 million Americans struggling for work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ad offers a preview of the tough message Mr. Obama will deliver during a two-day bus tour through Ohio and western Pennsylvania on Thursday and Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign said the ''Betting on America'' bus tour would kick off in Ohio, with events in Maumee, Sandusky and Parma, as well as in Pittsburgh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''As a corporate buyout specialist, he made massive profits by shuttering plants, firing workers and investing in companies that pioneered shipping of good American jobs overseas,'' the campaign said in a news release announcing the bus tour.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By THOM SHANKER, ERIC SCHMITT and DAVID E. SANGER.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The United States has quietly moved significant military reinforcements into the Persian Gulf to deter the Iranian military from any possible attempt to shut the Strait of Hormuz and to increase the number of fighter jets capable of striking deep into Iran if the standoff over its nuclear program escalates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deployments are part of a long-planned effort to bolster the American military presence in the gulf region, in part to reassure Israel that in dealing with Iran, as one senior administration official put it last week, ''When the president says there are other options on the table beyond negotiations, he means it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at a moment that the United States and its allies are beginning to enforce a much broader embargo on Iran's oil exports, meant to force the country to take seriously the negotiations over sharply limiting its nuclear program, the buildup carries significant risks, including that Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps could decide to lash out against the increased presence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most visible elements of this buildup are Navy ships designed to vastly enhance the ability to patrol the Strait of Hormuz -- and to reopen the narrow waterway should Iran attempt to mine it to prevent Saudi Arabia and other oil exporters from sending their tankers through the vital passage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Navy has doubled the number of minesweepers assigned to the region, to eight vessels, in what military officers describe as a purely defensive move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The message to Iran is, 'Don't even think about it,' '' one senior Defense Department official said. ''Don't even think about closing the strait. We'll clear the mines. Don't even think about sending your fast boats out to harass our vessels or commercial shipping. We'll put them on the bottom of the gulf.'' Like others interviewed, the official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the diplomatic and military situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since late spring, stealthy F-22 and older F-15C warplanes have moved into two separate bases in the Persian Gulf to bolster the combat jets already in the region and the carrier strike groups that are on constant tours of the area. Those additional attack aircraft give the United States military greater capability against coastal missile batteries that could threaten shipping, as well as the reach to strike other targets deeper inside Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Navy, after a crash development program, has moved a converted amphibious transport and docking ship, the Ponce, into the Persian Gulf to serve as the Pentagon's first floating staging base for military operations or humanitarian assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial assignment for the Ponce, Pentagon officials say, is to serve as a logistics and operations hub for mine-clearing. But with a medical suite and helicopter deck, and bunks for combat troops, the Ponce eventually could be used as a base for Special Operations forces to conduct a range of missions, including reconnaissance and counterterrorism, all from international waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For President Obama, the combination of negotiations, new sanctions aimed at Iran's oil revenues and increased military pressure is the latest -- and perhaps the most vital -- test of what the White House calls a ''two track'' policy against Iran. In the midst of a presidential election campaign in which his opponent, Mitt Romney, has accused him of being ''weak'' in dealing with the Iranian nuclear issue, Mr. Obama seeks to project toughness without tipping into a crisis in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time he must signal support for Israel, but not so much support that the Israelis see the buildup as an opportunity to strike the Iranian nuclear facilities, which Mr. Obama's team believes could set off a war without significantly setting back the Iranian program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key motivation for ''Olympic Games,'' the covert effort to undermine Iran's enrichment capability with cyberattacks, has been to demonstrate to the Israelis that there are more effective ways to slow the program than to strike from the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this delicate signaling to both Iran and Israel is a complex dance. Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the administration must strike a fine balance between positioning enough forces to deter Iran, but not inadvertently indicate to Iran or Israel that an attack on Iran's nuclear sites is imminent or inevitable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There are a lot of expectations to manage,'' Mr. Kerry said in an interview. ''People need to know you're serious, but you must also leave room for peaceful resolution. It's very important not to take steps that send the wrong messages here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little evidence that the increased pressure is having the desired effect. Negotiations with Iran are at a stalemate, though a group of Iranian, American and European experts are expected to meet in Istanbul on Tuesday to review a recent American proposal and Iranian response. So far, though, Iran has strenuously resisted all efforts to force it to give up enrichment of uranium, starting with production of a type that is considered relatively close to bomb grade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the tightening of Western sanctions, Iran on Monday announced that it would consider proposed legislation to disrupt traffic in the Strait of Hormuz as well as missile tests, in a drill clearly intended as a warning to Israel and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Iranian legislation calls for Iran's military to block any oil tanker en route to countries no longer buying Iranian crude because of the embargo. It was unclear whether the legislation would pass or precisely how Iran would enforce it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior Pentagon and military officials acknowledge that Iran has the capability to close the strait, at least temporarily, and the additional mine-clearing forces can be viewed as both concrete and spoken evidence of Washington's commitment to make sure any closing is as brief as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most significant Iranian threat to shipping came during its war of attrition with Iraq in the 1980s. Iran attacked tankers and other commercial traffic to disrupt Iraq's oil revenues and threaten shipments from other Arab states viewed as supporting Baghdad. Iran also laid significant numbers of mines in an attempt to block transit, prompting mine-clearing operations and attacks on the Iranian Navy by American warships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense Department officials stressed that the recent reshaping of American forces in the Persian Gulf region should not be viewed as solely about the potential nuclear threat from Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is not only about Iranian nuclear ambitions, but about Iran's regional hegemonic ambitions,'' the senior Defense Department official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a complex array of American military power that is tangible proof to all of our allies and partners and friends that even as the U.S. pivots toward Asia, we remain vigilant across the Middle East.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While American ground troops have been withdrawn from Iraq, a force equivalent to an extra Army combat brigade has remained in Kuwait, officials said. It could have many roles to contain regional instability, but Iran is a primary concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it always is difficult to read Iran's intentions, senior American Navy officers have noted that Iranian ships in the Persian Gulf have refrained recently from provocative behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Things have been, relatively speaking, quiet,'' said Adm. Jonathan W. Greenert, the chief of naval operations, assessing actions by Iranian Navy vessels over ''the last couple of months.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that was without the pressure of the new sanctions; already Iran is exporting far less oil every day than a year ago: about 1.5 million barrels a day versus 2.5 million before the gradual imposition of earlier sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Iranian vessels have avoided any confrontations with allied warships in recent weeks, Iran expects to equip its ships in the Strait of Hormuz soon with shorter-range missiles, a Revolutionary Guards commander said on Friday, according to the semiofficial Mehr news agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an eye on the threat of a belligerent Iran, the administration is also seeking to expand military ties with the six nations in the Gulf Cooperation Council: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and 19 other countries will hold a major mine countermeasure exercise in the Persian Gulf in September, said a senior military officer who noted that countries in the region were taking more steps in their own defense, including buying American-made air defense systems and other weaponry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Rupert Murdoch and Jack Welch have suggested that Mitt Romney needs new advisers to beat the president's team. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sun rises. The tides come in and out. And an outsider urges a presidential candidate to fire his advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing in politics is more predictable, and so Rupert Murdoch's tweet over the weekend was hardly surprising - though not many would have picked the conservative media mogul as the most likely source of the advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Met Romney last week,&quot;Mr. Murdoch said Sunday on Twitter. &quot;Tough O Chicago pros will be hard to beat unless he drops old friends from team and hires some real pros. Doubtful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Jack Welch, the former chairman and chief executive of General Electric, chimed in on Twitter: &quot;Hope Mitt Romney is listening to Murdoch advice on campaign staff. playing in league with Chicago pols. No room for amateurs&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message to Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was clear: dump your staff if you want to beat President Obama and his array of experienced, Chicago-based campaign operatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of Mr. Romney following this advice? Not likely. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney is running neck and neck with Mr. Obama nationally. The campaign is disciplined and precise. And the team is scooping up cash, having beat Mr. Obama in fund-raising by a wide margin in May. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Eric Fehrnstrom - one of the &quot;old friends&quot; running Mr. Romney's campaign - politely declined to depart, even as he once again generated unwanted news by disagreeing with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're very happy with the team that we have,&quot; Mr. Fehrnstrom said on MSNBC's &quot;Daily Rundown&quot; show. &quot;I can't respond to every tweet that Mr. Murdoch sends out. We like the way things are right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that same interview, Mr. Fehrnstrom's comment that the president's health care mandate is a penalty, not a tax, might have offered fresh ammunition for anyone who thought Mr. Romney needed some new advisers. (Earlier this year, it was also Mr. Fehrnstrom who suggested the general election campaign was like an Etch a Sketch toy.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Murdoch's missive came before those remarks and seemed as much to be a grudging admiration for the skill of Mr. Obama's team as it was a suggestion that Mr. Romney needed a new one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Murdoch may be genuinely worried about Mr. Romney's campaign team. Or he may just be tweaking Mr. Romney as he has for months. Last week, he chided Mr. Romney for deciding to &quot;play everything safe,&quot; asking: &quot;When is Romney going to look like a challenger?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, on Monday, Mr. Murdoch's latest Twitter message made it clear that he had heard objections from Mr. Romney's high command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney people upset at me!&quot; Mr. Murdoch wrote. &quot;Of course I want him to win, save us from socialism, etc. but should listen to good advice and get stuck in!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about the suggestion that Mr. Romney retool his campaign? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea is usually floated during times of crisis - like the moment in 2008 when Hillary Rodham Clinton lost the Iowa caucuses and seemed to be on the brink of elimination heading into the New Hampshire primaries. Her victory in New Hampshire delayed a staff shake-up that came a few weeks later, amid further losses to Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, four years ago, Senator John McCain's presidential campaign imploded after a feud among his senior advisers ended in a mass walkout. Mr. McCain brought in Steve Schmidt, a veteran operative, to run the show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign team has been remarkably stable, though Democratic critics have complained for years about the failure of the president's communications team to effectively combat the Republican message machine. The 2008 team is back, shuffled into different desks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney is already on version 2.0 of a presidential campaign staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, he assembled his first presidential campaign organization, filled with longtime friends at the helm in Boston, but also with a myriad highly-paid consultants who constantly bickered about the right way to win the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, he lost. And when Mr. Romney assembled a new team for 2012, it was a pared-down version of the old one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still in place: Beth Myers, a longtime confidant; Mr. Fehrnstrom, his former spokesman and adviser; Bob White, a personal friend and business partner; Matt Rhoades, a communications czar who now runs the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of them are likely to depart. But the consultants have been whittled down. Ad makers Stuart Stevens and Russ Schriefer are now the primary message mavens, having won the battles of 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could a shake-up happen? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With four months to go, the stakes are rising, and there is some evidence that the attacks on Mr. Romney's time at Bain Capital are beginning to have some impact on his poll numbers in swing states. If that trend continues, there will be increasing pressure on his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides say Mr. Romney is incredibly loyal to his staff, so it is hard to imagine him dumping them for a new team at the last minute. But Mr. Romney is also an experienced business executive who spent part of his life in high-stakes deal-making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps no one is irreplaceable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A TV ad released Tuesday by the Obama campaign intensified its argument that Mitt Romney's companies at Bain Capital sent jobs to low-wage countries, despite criticism of previous ads by fact-checking groups. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's campaign on Tuesday intensified its attacks on Mitt Romney for outsourcing jobs, releasing a new TV ad that accuses the former Massachusetts governor's old private equity firm of shipping jobs to low-wage countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent fact-checking groups have criticized Mr. Obama's previous ads on the issue, saying there is scant evidence for the claim that Mr. Romney's companies shut down operations in the United States while opening new facilities in other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Factcheck.orgconcluded last week that &quot;we found no evidence to support the claim that Romney - while he was still running Bain Capital -  shipped American jobs overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is no indication that Mr. Obama plans to let up. In a letter to Factcheck.org released on Sunday, Stephanie Cutter, the deputy campaign manager for Mr. Obama, challenged a key premise of the group's analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You state that, 'there's no evidence that he took any active role in Bain's decisions after he left in February 1999,'&quot; Ms. Cutter wrote. &quot;This is simply incorrect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's latest ad, entitled &quot;Believe,&quot; will run in nine battleground states, the campaign said in a release Tuesday morning. They are Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad's narrator says that &quot;Mitt Romney's companies were pioneers in outsourcing U.S. jobs to low-wage countries,&quot; showing an image of a recent Washington Post article on the subject. (Mr. Romney's campaign has complained that the story was &quot;100 percent wrong&quot; but the Post has stood firm.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad explicitly compares Mr. Romney to Mr. Obama, saying that the Republican &quot;supports tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas,&quot; while Mr. Obama &quot;believes in insourcing&quot; and &quot;fought to save the U.S. auto industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amanda Henneberg, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, accused Mr. Obama's campaign of trying to mislead voters by using claims that have been disproved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are happy to put Governor Romney's record of job creation in the private sector, and as governor, up against President Obama's any day,&quot; Ms. Henneberg said. &quot;Spending millions of dollars on untrue ads won't change the fact that President Obama's policies have left more than 23 million Americans struggling for work.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ad offers a preview of the tough message Mr. Obama will deliver during a two-day bus tour through Ohio and western Pennsylvania on Thursday and Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign said the &quot;Betting on America&quot; bus tour would kick off in Ohio, with events in Maumee, Sandusky and Parma, as well as in Pittsburgh. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a corporate buyout specialist, he made massive profits by shuttering plants, firing workers and investing in companies that pioneered shipping of good American jobs overseas,&quot; the campaign said in a news release announcing the bus tour.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;West Virginia is a conservative state where Republicans win presidential elections and Democrats predominate in state government. That disconnect is partly explained by party loyalty and partly by the importance of coal in the state. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barring a truly shocking turn of events, Mitt Romney will win West Virginia's five electoral votes. The state is rural, culturally conservative and religious. Of the 50 states, West Virginia has the fifth highest share of gun owners, the third oldest median age and one of the least diverse and least educated populations -- all variables associated with Republican Party affiliation. After decades of Democratic dominance, West Virginia voted for the Republican candidate in the last three presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just like Georgia, the last state profiled in this series, West Virginia has gone from solid blue to solid red on presidential electoral maps. But unlike Georgia, West Virginia still elects Democrats in statewide races. Both of West Virginia's senators are Democrats, as is the state's governor. Democrats claims large majorities in the State Senate and the West Virginia House of Delegates. And Democrats still maintain almost a 2-1 registration edge over Republicans in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How have Democrats maintained support in such a conservative state? And does the party's remaining strength signal that West Virginia might once again become competitive in presidential campaigns?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the answer to the first question is lingering loyalty. &quot;You can always find someone at a rally who will say, 'I would vote Republican, but my dad would kill me,'&quot; Mr. Rupp said. The more fundamental answer, however, is that Democratic candidates in West Virginia often bear little resemblance to national Democrats. State Democrats tend to be more conservative on a range of issues. Moreover, they emphasize their independence from the national party. Just recently, Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, Sen. Joe Manchin and Rep. Nick Rahall, all announced that they would not attend the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The greatest sources of conflict between national and West Virginia Democrats are energy and environmental policies. Coal was the lifeblood of the state's economy for decades, and -- despite receding as an employer in the state -- is still an integral part of the West Virginia psyche (the state's flag features a farmer and coal miner). A pro-coal stance in West Virginia is as vital a component in electability as being from West Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Al Gore's perceived hostility to coal and mountaintop mining that helped George W. Bush carry the state in 2000, after it had voted Democratic in 14 of the 17 presidential elections since the Great Depression, when West Virginia began electing Democrats in earnest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the 2000 election, as national Democrats have pursued policies to lower greenhouse gas emissions, West Virginia Democrats have had to work even harder to show their pro-coal bonafides. Mr. Manchin, for example, actually shot the 2007 cap-and-trade bill in a campaign commercial (as governor, he also sued the Environmental Protection Agency over limits on mountaintop mining).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But King Coal's power in the state may not last indefinitely. In 1948, 126,000 West Virginians worked in coalmines. In 2011, that number was 22,336.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As easily accessible coal seams have been depleted, the so-called &quot;coal counties&quot; in southern West Virginia have lost population. At the same time, less coal-centric areas of the state - the Washington D.C. exurbs in the eastern panhandle and the communities around Morgantown, where West Virginia University is located - have gained population, Mr. Plein said. The coal industry has also been hurt by a boom in cheap natural gas in the Marcellus Shale. About 2,000 coal mining jobs have been shed in just the last few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many West Virginians are looking to other industries, such as tourism, to replace resource extraction as the state's economic backbone. Wal-Mart is currently the biggest employer in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the coal industry remains politically potent. Late last month, when West Virginia Senator Jay Rockefeller gave a floor speech in favor of an Obama administration rule that the coal industry opposes, it was interpreted as proof that Mr. Rockefeller was planning to retire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bellwether</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Nov. 6, Election Day, those who are particularly impatient for West Virginia election results can look to Marshall County for clues. Part of West Virginia's northern panhandle, Marshall County -- like much of north West Virginia - is culturally and economically part of the Pittsburgh area. In the last three elections, Marshall voters have been a virtually perfect barometer of the statewide vote, matching it exactly in 2008 when both the state and county voted 53 percent to 43 percent for Senator John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bottom Line</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FiveThirtyEight model currently gives Mr. Obama just a 5 percent chance of winning in West Virginia. Mr. Romney is projected to expand on Senator John McCain's 2008 margin of victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compounding the issue-specific rightward pull on state Democrats, there is also an absence of a leftward pull. While a state like Georgia has large urban and minority communities, which tend to elect fairly liberal Democrats, West Virginia is 94 percent white and rural. There just aren't that many liberal or progressive voters in West Virginia. In 2008, 48 percent of voters were Democrats, but just 18 percent of voters described themselves as liberal, according to exit polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diminishing impact of coal as a political force in the state may be a hopeful sign for Democrats. But as long as there are major issues -- like energy -- where the positions of the national Democratic Party (and thus Democratic presidential candidates) are anathema in West Virginia, it is likely Republicans will continue to win the state in presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more immediate question is: will state-level races, where Democrats still dominate, begin to shift and match the state's Republican preference in presidential elections?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't have a two-legged stool,&quot; Mr. Rupp said, &quot;at some point West Virginia is going to change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;One official chalked up the decision - not surprisingly - to the demands of the re-election campaign calendar. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama remained cloistered with his wife and daughters at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, for a fourth and final day on Tuesday&nbsp; - a rare long-weekend getaway that reflects the fact that the first family will forgo its usual August vacation in this election year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House officials confirmed that the Obama family will not return to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts as it has each summer of the president's term, and for years before. One official, who asked not to be identified discussing the Obamas' private plans, chalked up the decision - not surprisingly - to the demands of the re-election campaign calendar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are likely to take a family vacation, though probably shorter than the usual, the official said, without divulging the time or place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With word of Mr. Obama's plans, the Republican National Committee quickly tweaked him in an e-mail. It linked to a video recalling the decision of Bill Clinton, another habitu&eacute; of the Vineyard, to skip the island when he faced re-election - on the advice of pollsters who argued that hobnobbing in the summertime sanctuary of affluent elites was not a great political image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For three years the arrival of the presidential entourage on Martha's Vineyard - family, advisers and staff, Secret Service and press representatives - was a boon in hard times to its tourist industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was our own little Martha's Vineyard recovery act,&quot; quipped Susan Goldstein, owner of the Mansion House inn in Vineyard Haven, which became home to dozens of news media representatives, staff members and security agents. &quot;But we've had a very good early season this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Goldstein said she and her husband had learned &quot;quite some time ago&quot; that the White House would not be booking rooms in August. &quot;But because hotels don't comment on who's staying and who's declining, we didn't tell anyone,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mansion House received publicity each year not least for its owner's patriotic bunting and pro-Obama banners (&quot;Having achieved so much against division and dysfunction, President Obama deserves a Vineyard vacation,&quot; read the one last year). Also, television networks broadcast from the inn's rooftop cupola overlooking the picturesque Vineyard Sound.&nbsp; The hotel's Web site includes the boast, &quot;Host to the White House press corps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama and his family stayed at a 28-acre property, Blue Heron Farm, several miles away among other estates secluded in woods and meadows in the island's rural southwest. The Boston Globe reported that the state police on Martha's Vineyard have also been told that the Obamas were not coming and that the farm that they rented at their own expense had been sold to a British couple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser and confidante of the president and first lady who has vacationed on Martha's Vineyard since childhood, also will not be going there&nbsp; this election season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, the Obamas will be back in the White House for their usual Fourth of July activities - a barbecue, concert and fireworks-watching with members of the military and their families. Also, Mr. Obama will host a naturalization ceremony in the East Room at which active-duty service members will become citizens. Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, will deliver the oath of allegiance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then on Thursday and Friday, Mr. Obama hits the campaign trail, with a bus trip in the battleground states of Ohio and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Executive of Barclays Resigns &nbsp;|&nbsp; Robert E. Diamond Jr., the chief executive of Barclays, resigned on Tuesday, less than a week after the British bank agreed to pay $450 million to settle accusations that it had tried to manipulate key interest rates for its own benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Diamond's resignation, which was effective immediately, comes after mounting criticism of the bank's actions from politicians and shareholders. Prime Minister David Cameron had called on individuals within the bank to take responsibility, while other British politicians had said Mr. Diamond should resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Diamond's decision to leave was made on Monday afternoon in response to this pressure, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. Mr. Diamond had wanted to avoid a protracted public spotlight focused on the bank's past activities, the person added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My motivation has always been to do what I believed to be in the best interests of Barclays,&quot; Mr. Diamond said in a statement. &quot;No decision over that period was as hard as the one that I make now to stand down as chief executive. The external pressure placed on Barclays has reached a level that risks damaging the franchise. I cannot let that happen.&quot; DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Brokers Say JPMorgan Favored Selling Bank's Own Funds Over Others &nbsp;|&nbsp; Facing a slump after the financial crisis, JPMorgan Chase turned to ordinary investors to make up for the lost profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the bank became one of the nation's largest mutual fund managers, some current and former brokers say it emphasized its sales over clients' needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These financial advisers say they were encouraged, at times, to favor JPMorgan's own products even when competitors had better-performing or cheaper options. With one crucial offering, the bank exaggerated the returns of what it was selling in marketing materials, according to JPMorgan documents reviewed by The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The benefit to JPMorgan is clear. The more money investors plow into the bank's funds, the more fees it collects for managing them. The aggressive sales push has allowed JPMorgan to buck an industry trend. Amid the market volatility, ordinary investors are leaving stock funds in droves. DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Caymans, It's Simple to Fill a Hedge Fund Board &nbsp;|&nbsp; In the last decade, as hedge funds ballooned in size and number to become a dominant force in the investing universe, directorship services have grown from a cottage industry into a big business on the Cayman Islands. Many funds run by United States money managers have their legal residence here for tax reasons. And because of a quirk in the island's tax code, these funds must appoint a board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, dozens of operations have sprouted up on the Caymans to supply directors, from one-man bucket shops to powerhouse law firms. Directors are often Cayman-based professionals: accountants, lawyers and administrators of hedge funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are rarely investors, though. Ostensibly, directors offer guidance and oversight to the funds. In return, a director is typically paid anywhere from $5,000 to $30,000 a year. With more than 9,000 funds domiciled on the tiny island, business is booming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so is a debate. Major investors and others are starting to question the value of offshore directors, especially in light of recent hedge fund frauds, liquidations and missteps. An analysis of thousands of United States securities filings by The New York Times shows that dozens of directors sit on the boards of 24 or more funds in the Caymans, which individually are supposed to be overseeing tens of billions of dollars in assets. Some hold more than 100 directorships, and one particularly busy director sits on the boards of about 260 hedge funds.<BR>DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman of Barclays Resigns &nbsp;|&nbsp; Marcus Agius, the chairman of Barclays, resigned on Monday, less than a week after the big British bank agreed to pay $450 million to settle accusations that it had tried to manipulate key interest rates to benefit its own bottom line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resignation comes as Barclays tries to limit fallout from the case, which is part of a broad investigation into how big banks set certain rates that affect borrowing costs for consumers and companies. Since striking a deal with American and British authorities last Wednesday, the Barclays management team has faced increasing pressure from politicians and shareholders to take action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week's events have dealt a devastating blow to Barclays' reputation,&quot; Mr. Agius said in a statement. &quot;As chairman, I am the ultimate guardian of the bank's reputation. Accordingly, the buck stops with me and I must acknowledge responsibility by standing aside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Agius, the first casualty, will remain as chairman until a successor has been found. Michael Rake, a senior independent director on the Barclays board and a former chairman of the accounting firm KPMG, has been appointed deputy chairman, according to a statement from the bank.<BR>DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>

But they are doing so without the help of Mitt Romney.&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:43 p.m. | Updated The Republican message machine is trying hard to accuse President Obama of increasing taxes on middle-class Americans after the Supreme Court's ruling that the health care mandate is valid as an exercise of the government's taxing power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the party is doing so without the help of Mitt Romney, whose own health plan in Massachusetts contained an almost identical mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Eric Fehrnstrom, Mr. Romney's senior adviser, strayed wildly from the coordinated comments of the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill and other party strategists by saying Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, agrees with Democrats that Mr. Obama's health care mandate is not a tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The governor disagreed with the ruling of the court,&quot; Mr. Fehrnstrom said on MSNBC's &quot;The Daily Rundown&quot; program. &quot;He agreed with the dissent written by Justice Scalia, which very clearly stated that the mandate was not a tax.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chuck Todd, the show's host, suggested that Mr. Romney &quot;believes that you should not call the tax penalty a tax. You should call it a penalty or a fee or a fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's correct,&quot; Mr. Fehrnstrom said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The awkwardly off-message response is an example of the difficulty that Mr. Romney has in carrying the conservative mantle on health care - an outcome that Mr. Romney's Republican rivals predicted during the Republican primaries would come to pass. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attacks by Mr. Romney on the president's health care plan inevitably lead to comparisons to his similar plan in Massachusetts. And while Mr. Romney has pledged to completely repeal what conservatives call &quot;Obamacare,&quot; he has been silent on whether its insurance mandate is a tax on Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, just hours after the Supreme Court ruling, Mr. Romney's statement avoided the issue even as lawmakers were taking to the House and Senate floors to gleefully seize on the court's surprising justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican establishment continued that effort over the weekend. On Sunday, Speaker John A. Boehner and other top Republicans insisted that the court revealed a truth that Mr. Obama had wanted to avoid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though the president tried to admit for, you know, over a year that it wasn't a tax, nobody believed it, and now we know it,&quot; Mr. Boehner said on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation&quot; program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, accused Mr. Obama of purposely misleading Congress in order to get the health care bill passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president, on your show, said this is not a tax,&quot; Mr. Ryan said on ABC's &quot;This Week&quot; program. &quot;Then he sent the solicitor general to the Supreme Court to argue that it is a tax in order to get this past the Supreme Court. The broken promises and the hypocrisy are becoming breathtaking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the National Republican Campaign Committee began running television commercials attacking the health care ruling. In an e-mail to reporters, a committee spokesman accused Democrats of driving &quot;circles in a rhetorical cul-de-sac on the difference between a penalty and a tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee tweeted: &quot;White House still desperately trying not to call the healthcare mandate what it is: a tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats fought back against that characterization on Sunday. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, said on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; program that the health care mandate includes a &quot;penalty&quot; for a small number of &quot;free riders&quot; who choose not to buy insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a penalty that comes under the tax code for the 1 percent, perhaps, of the population who may decide that they're going to be free riders. But most people are not affected by that,&quot; Ms. Pelosi said. &quot;It's not a tax on the -- it's a penalty for free riders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Mr. Romney pursues the presidency for a second time, some of his past statements match up more closely with the Democrats than with the Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument made by Ms. Pelosi on Sunday was the very one that Mr. Romney made in 2006 when he was fighting for his state health care plan. And he repeated that argument in the years after, including during a debate in the 2008 presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, we said, 'Look, if people can afford to buy it, either buy the insurance or pay your own way,' &quot; Mr. Romney said during a January 2008 debate in New Hampshire. &quot;Don't be free riders and pass the cost of health care on to everybody else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an opinion article in USA Today in 2009, Mr. Romney again used the term &quot;free riders,&quot; writing that a penalty like that in his health care plan &quot;encourages 'free riders' to take responsibility for themselves rather than pass their medical cost on to others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On MSNBC on Monday, Mr. Fehrnstrom tried to stress that Mr. Romney does not believe that the Massachusetts health care plan would work as a federal plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we did works in Massachusetts,&quot; he said. &quot;It was never meant to be a one-size-fits-all for the entire nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his comments may have undercut Mr. Romney's Republican allies, who were hoping the tax argument would be a bit of good news in an otherwise disappointing Supreme Court ruling. Even as Mr. Fehrnstrom was declaring that the mandate is not a tax, the headline under his image said otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;GOP: Mandate is one big tax,&quot; it read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, urged Mr. Obama to clarify his position on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court left President Obama with two choices: the federal individual mandate in Obamacare is either a constitutional tax or an unconstitutional penalty. Governor Romney thinks it is an unconstitutional penalty,&quot; she said. &quot;What is President Obama's position: is his federal mandate unconstitutional or is it a tax?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Supreme Court's upholding of the health-care law was last week's most important event in historical terms, it will not be the decisive event of the 2012 election. In the long run, polling in swing states suggesting that Mitt Romney's tenure at Bain Capital is hurting him could have larger implications for where this campaign will move.          It's certainly true that had the court knocked down President Obama's signature domestic achievement, the defeat would have been woven into a narrative of ineffectual leadership and mistaken priorities. Instead, the president found vindication not only from the court's liberals but also from Chief Justice John Roberts.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But precisely because the decision saved the president from disaster on health care, it only reinforced the importance of the economic argument Obama and Romney have been having for months. And here is where Romney's Bain problem kicks in. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Democrats, mostly from Washington and New York, debated the efficacy of attacks on Romney's role in Bain, an entirely different conversation was being driven in the swing states, courtesy of ads broadcast by the Obama campaign and especially by Priorities USA Action, the pro-Obama super PAC. The ads portray highly sympathetic workers who lost their jobs and companies that collapsed even as Bain's principals made substantial profits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last week provided surprisingly dramatic evidence of how much these commercials are wounding Romney.          In the country as a whole, 23 percent said they viewed Romney more positively because of his experience &quot;managing a firm that specializes in buying, restructuring and selling companies,&quot; while 28 percent said this made them view Romney more negatively. But in this year's 12 battleground states, many of which have gotten a heavy run of the anti-Bain ads, only 18 percent viewed Romney's business experience positively; 33 percent viewed it negatively. Obama led Romney by three points nationally but by eight in the battlegrounds.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is disturbing news for Romney, who hoped his business experience would be an unalloyed asset. The numbers also underscore voter resistance to the core conservative claim that job creation is primarily about rewarding wealthy investors and companies through further tax cuts and less regulation. Americans are not anti-business, but they are skeptical that everything that is good for corporations is also good for their employees, and for job creation itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bain ads have done double-duty, specifically undermining Romney but also serving as a parable for how aspects of the current financial system hurt workers and local communities. Profits and productivity can rise even as real wages stagnate or fall, and jobs can be offshored and outsourced. The Romney campaign's response to a recent Washington Post story describing Bain's record on outsourcing - the campaign sought to &quot;differentiate between domestic outsourcing versus offshoring&quot; - sounded more like bureaucratic gobbledygook than an effective answer. Obama picked up on the story immediately, calling Romney an &quot;outsourcing pioneer.&quot;           But can the Obama campaign turn the argument over Romney and Bain into a broader challenge to the Republican claim that the only thing government can do to spur job creation is to get out of the way? &quot;Jobs&quot; will remain the Romney battle cry for the rest of the campaign, but the success of the anti-Bain offensive points to an opportunity for Obama to engage in a kind of political jujitsu. He can argue that Romney's primary interest is not in job creation at all but in low-tax and deregulatory policies he would favor whether the economy was soaring or flat.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent talk at the Center for American Progress, Stefan L&ouml;fven, the new leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, outlined a way to turn the debate around, arguing that job creation worldwide should be the focus of center-left parties. New policies on job creation should also be concerned with the quality and conditions of the jobs, how quickly the unemployed can be moved to new work and how the unemployed are treated and assisted toward new opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are the questions voters should be encouraged to ask in 2012: Should government focus directly on innovative approaches to creating good jobs in a new economy? Or should it be relegated to a position of powerlessness in which its only option is to concede ever more benefits to those - including the financial wizards at Bain - who are already doing very well indeed?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WILMINGTON, Del.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOTHING about 1209 North Orange Street hints at the secrets inside. It's a humdrum office building, a low-slung affair with a faded awning and a view of a parking garage. Hardly worth a second glance. If a first one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But behind its doors is one of the most remarkable corporate collections in the world: 1209 North Orange, you see, is the legal address of no fewer than 285,000 separate businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its occupants, on paper, include giants like American Airlines, Apple, Bank of America, Berkshire Hathaway, Cargill, Coca-Cola, Ford, General Electric, Google, JPMorgan Chase, and Wal-Mart. These companies do business across the nation and around the world. Here at 1209 North Orange, they simply have a dropbox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What attracts these marquee names to 1209 North Orange and to other Delaware addresses also attracts less-upstanding corporate citizens. For instance, 1209 North Orange was, until recently, a business address of Timothy S. Durham, known as ''the Midwest Madoff.'' On June 20, Mr. Durham was found guilty of bilking 5,000 mostly middle-class and elderly investors out of $207 million. It was also an address of Stanko Subotic, a Serbian businessman and convicted smuggler -- just one of many Eastern Europeans drawn to the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big corporations, small-time businesses, rogues, scoundrels and worse -- all have turned up at Delaware addresses in hopes of minimizing taxes, skirting regulations, plying friendly courts or, when needed, covering their tracks. Federal authorities worry that, in addition to the legitimate businesses flocking here, drug traffickers, embezzlers and money launderers are increasingly heading to Delaware, too. It's easy to set up shell companies here, no questions asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Shells are the No. 1 vehicle for laundering illicit money and criminal proceeds,'' said Lanny A. Breuer, assistant attorney general for the criminal division of the Justice Department. ''It's an enormous criminal justice problem. It's ridiculously easy for a criminal to set up a shell corporation and use the banking system, and we have to stop it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these troubled economic times, when many states are desperate for tax dollars, Delaware stands out in sharp relief. The First State, land of DuPont, broiler chickens and, as it happens, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., increasingly resembles a freewheeling offshore haven, right on America's shores. Officials in other states complain that Delaware's cozy corporate setup robs their states of billions of tax dollars. Officials in the Cayman Islands, a favorite Caribbean haunt of secretive hedge funds, say Delaware is today playing faster and looser than the offshore jurisdictions that raise hackles in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And international bodies, most recently the World Bank, are increasingly pointing fingers at the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, business -- the legal kind -- has been the business of Delaware since 1792, when the state established its Court of Chancery to handle business affairs. By the early 20th century, the state was writing friendly corporate and tax laws to lure companies from New York, New Jersey and elsewhere. Most of the businesses incorporated here are legitimate and many are using all legal means to reduce their tax bills -- something that most stockholders applaud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has criticized outposts like the Caymans, complaining that they harbor giant tax schemes. But here in Wilmington, just over 100 miles from Washington, is in some ways the biggest corporate haven of all. It takes less than an hour to incorporate a company in Delaware, and the state is so eager to attract businesses that the office of its secretary of state stays open until midnight Monday through Thursday -- and until 10:30 p.m. on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly half of all public corporations in the United States are incorporated in Delaware. Last year, 133,297 businesses set up here. And, at last count, Delaware had more corporate entities, public and private, than people -- 945,326 to 897,934.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Delaware company was used last year to make an anonymous $1 million donation to Restore Our Future, a super PAC that favors Mitt Romney for president. Restore Our Future ultimately disclosed that the money came from a former Bain Capital executive. The Romney campaign declined comment, and Restore Our Future did not return calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delaware's tax laws are a bonanza for the state. At a time when many states are being squeezed by a difficult economy, Delaware collected roughly $860 million in taxes and fees from its absentee corporate residents in 2011. That money accounted for a quarter of the state's total budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Companies choose our state and we are proud of it,'' said Richard J. Geisenberger, Delaware's chief deputy secretary of state and its leading ambassador to business. ''We spend a lot of time in the United States and traveling internationally to let people know that Delaware is a great place to do business.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also a great place to reduce a tax bill. Delaware today regularly tops lists of domestic and foreign tax havens because it allows companies to lower their taxes in another state -- for instance, the state in which they actually do business or have their headquarters -- by shifting royalties and similar revenues to holding companies in Delaware, where they are not taxed. In tax circles, the arrangement is known as ''the Delaware loophole.'' Over the last decade, the Delaware loophole has enabled corporations to reduce the taxes paid to other states by an estimated $9.5 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State lawmakers in Pennsylvania are now trying to close the loophole, arguing that their state is being robbed of its tax dollars. Of particular concern is that many companies involved in drilling for natural gas in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania are, in fact, incorporating in Delaware instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Delaware is an outlier in the way it does business,'' said David E. Brunori, a professor at George Washington Law School and an expert on taxation. ''What it offers is an opportunity to game the system and do it legally.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT does it take to incorporate a company in Delaware? Not a lot, tax experts say. Shell companies -- those with no employees, no assets and, in fact, no real business to speak of -- are remarkably easy to establish here, and it doesn't always matter who you are or what business you are in. Viktor Bout, the Russian arms dealer known as ''the merchant of death,'' used two Delaware addresses. In April he was sentenced to 25 years in prison on terrorism charges resulting from an American sting operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack Abramoff, the former Washington lobbyist jailed on corruption charges, set up a sham Delaware corporation to hide millions in payments and circumvent federal laws. Mr. Subotic, the Serbian businessman who was tried in absentia last October for his role in a cigarette smuggling scheme and sentenced to six years, used three airplanes that were registered in Delaware, including two at 1209 North Orange. Mr. Subotic lives in Geneva and denies the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, an international group based in Sarajevo, has identified other Eastern Europeans with Delaware links. Among them is Laszlo Kiss, an Romanian accountant and author of ''United States, Tax Heaven -- Uncle Sam Will Fight Your Taxes!'' that praised the state's lax rules. He is now awaiting trial in Bucharest on charges of helping embezzle and launder $10 million through Delaware shells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Delaware is the state that requires the least amount of information,'' says David Finzer, the chief executive of Capital Conservator, a registration agent that sets up accounts in Delaware and elsewhere for non-United States citizens. ''Basically, it requires none. Delaware has the most secret companies in the world and the easiest to form.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Finzer, an American based in Novi Sad, Serbia, advertises his services online. ''Tax-Free Havens for Non-U.S. Citizens,'' his Web site, says. It goes on: ''More than 50 percent of the major corporations in the world are incorporated in Delaware. Why? Because in provides the anonymity that most offshore jurisdictions do not offer.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is exactly what troubles law enforcement agencies and some in Congress who are trying to rein in Delaware. The state is seen as an onshore alternative with regulations more lax than such well-known offshore tax havens as the Isle of Man, Jersey and the Caymans, which require greater disclosure. Even more, a Delaware registration allows a business, legitimate or not, to open a bank account anywhere in the world with the patina of an American address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You can have companies in Delaware that have no U.S. bank accounts, no requirements for documentation and no one knows who owns them,'' says Anthony B. Travers, chairman of the Cayman Islands Stock Exchange and former chairman of that country's Financial Services Association. ''There should be a level playing field and Delaware should have to comply with the same standards as the Caymans.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delaware isn't the only state that has gone this route. Three others -- Nevada, Wyoming and Oregon -- have also been cited by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a division of the United States Treasury Department, as ''particularly appealing'' for the formation of shell companies. Of those four states, Delaware stands out as the one offering the least transparency and the most secrecy, this group says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What is so galling about secrecy in the United States is that there is no attempt to document who owns a corporation,'' said Richard Murphy, a senior adviser at the Tax Justice Network, an independent organization based in London that researches tax havens. ''Two million corporations are formed each year in the United States, more than anywhere else in the world. Delaware, in turn, is the biggest single source of anonymous corporations in the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Murphy adds: ''Why go to the Caymans when you can just go down the street?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2009, the Tax Justice Network named the United States as No. 1 on its Financial Secrecy Index, ahead of Luxembourg and Switzerland. It cited Delaware as one of the reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, Mr. Murphy says, elicited howls in Wilmington. ''The reaction was: 'This cannot be true.' Not only can it be true, it is true.'' (The United States has since fallen to fifth place, behind Switzerland, the Caymans, Luxembourg and Hong Kong, after the group changed its method.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, has been leading a quixotic effort to adopt legislation that would require states to collect information on the ''beneficial ownership'' of companies incorporated within their borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would require states to add the name of the person standing behind the corporation -- its beneficial owner -- on incorporation papers. To sweeten the pot, the legislation would exempt public companies, hedge funds and other large corporations, along with mom-and-pop businesses where ownership is clear. In addition, the federal government would pick up the tab for putting the law into effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Levin has long complained that it takes more information to get a driver's license than to set up a corporation in America. Three times since 2000, he has introduced his legislation -- once co-sponsored by Barack Obama when he was a senator from Illinois -- and each time the effort has been rebuffed. He has never even been able to get the measure out of committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement agencies, human rights groups and the administration are on his side. Last month, a letter supporting Mr. Levin's measure and signed by 41 different groups was sent to every member of Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that has been no match for the opposition. Most vocal is the National Association of Secretaries of State, a politically powerful group. It is backed up by the Chamber of Commerce, the American Bar Association and the state of Delaware, which is the lone state to have hired a lobbyist to work on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Thomas R. Carper, a Delaware Democrat, is in line to be the next chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction over the measure. Mr. Carper has expressed concerns about the measure but has taken no formal position on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Levin is hitting a brick wall,'' said Heather Lowe, director of government affairs for Global Financial Integrity, an anticorruption research group. ''It's frustrating. Delaware is playing a significant role in the committee. Senator Carper is well liked and well respected and he's not moving on this issue.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretaries of state, along with Delaware, argue that the Levin measure would be costly and burdensome, and would discourage business incorporation and capital formation. They add that their offices are generally ill-equipped to process the additional data that would be required. Even more, determining beneficial ownership may not be a simple matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This would be a sea change in how things are done,'' said Ross Miller, Nevada's secretary of state and president-elect of the National Association of Secretaries of State. ''It would add red tape and increasing processing time. And if you had a money launderer and asked for his name, he probably wouldn't be truthful.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Geisenberger, the chief deputy secretary of state of Delaware, said of the Levin measure: ''This would be a massive inhibitor to starting a business. It would end up taking weeks or months to get a business started. And I think a lot of them would move underground and into the black market and just not form a legal entity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMPANIES that are incorporated in Delaware need someone on the ground here -- an agent or go-between to act on their behalf. That is where the CT Corporation comes in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CT, a subsidiary of the Dutch information services company Wolters Kluwer, is the largest registered agent in Delaware and, it turns out, the registered agent for 1209 North Orange Street. CT is authorized to transact business at that address, and its main duty is to accept legal notices on behalf of the businesses incorporated here and to pass them along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CT represents nearly a third of all companies registered in Delaware and 60 percent of Fortune 500 companies. It says that before accepting clients, it screens them against the government's ''Specially Designated Nationals,'' a list of people barred from doing business in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mainly, however, CT says it acts as a middleman. ''We check names and addresses against various federal agency lists,'' says Timothy Hall, a spokesman for the company, which has no position on the Levin measure. ''We will comply with whatever law is passed,'' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The New York Times Company has seven corporate subsidiaries registered at 2711 Centerville Road in Wilmington. The registered agent for that address is the Corporation Service Company, which is the second-largest agent in the state.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For corporate tax planners, Delaware is a dream. The state helps companies legitimately reduce their United States taxes and, sometimes, obscure profits in other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Companies are able to turn taxable income into tax-exempt income in Delaware and then use it to reduce their tax bills in other states,'' said Bradley P. Lindsey, an accounting professor at North Carolina State University and one of three authors of a 2011 study titled ''Exploring the Role Delaware Plays as a Domestic Tax Haven.'' Delaware does not tax certain profit-making intangible items -- like trademarks, royalties, leases and copyrights. Yet those same intangibles can be part of a tax strategy that allows them to be classified as deductions in other states, reducing a company's tax bill there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Delaware serves as a domestic tax haven, much like the Cayman Islands serves as an offshore foreign tax haven, and offers a similar level of tax avoidance,'' the report states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American corporations find the Caymans alluring for many reasons. There, they can operate in relative secrecy, attract more foreign customers, avoid regulation and enjoy a low tax rate. In one respect, however, Delaware is even better than the Caymans. At some point, American companies have to bring back their foreign profits from the Caymans and pay federal taxes. But in Delaware, the state tax savings through the Delaware loophole are permanent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on the reputational front, ''Delaware doesn't carry the same stigma as the Caymans or Bermuda,'' Mr. Lindsay said, adding, ''Why not attract business to my little state and get something at the expense of the other states?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WorldCom, the telecom giant that collapsed into bankruptcy after an accounting scandal, could be a symbol for the Delaware loophole. Bankruptcy court filings showed that the company had cut $20 billion from state taxes thanks to an intangible asset it called ''management foresight.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delaware subsidiaries are especially popular with global energy and mining companies like Exxon, Chevron and Rio Tinto. Among the top 10, some 915 subsidiaries have been set up in Delaware, compared with 51 in Switzerland and 49 in the Caymans, according to a report last September by the Norway chapter of Publish What You Pay, a London-based group that studies natural resources. The study said that this allows these resource extraction companies to put up a ''wall of silence'' about their far-flung operations and profits, especially from poor countries that may want a greater slice of the revenue. Exxon, Chevron and Rio Tinto declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STATES like Pennsylvania are increasingly fed up. More than 400 corporate subsidiaries linked to Marcellus Shale gas exploration have been registered in Delaware, most within the last four years, according to the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, a nonprofit group based in Harrisburg that studies the state's tax policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, the center estimated that the Delaware loophole had cost the state $400 million annually in lost revenue -- and that was before the energy boom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than two-thirds of the companies in the Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry alliance based in Pittsburgh, are registered to a single address: 1209 North Orange Street, according to the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''So many of these Marcellus Shale companies have figured out that it is fairly easy to siphon profits from Pennsylvania, so that they don't pay taxes here,'' said Michael Wood, research director at the Harrisburg center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center is urging Pennsylvania to try to close the Delaware loophole. But it is running into opposition from Pennsylvania companies that want to retain the break. And, in Delaware, state officials say that their approach to business is good for America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have a system that is the greatest creator of wealth in the history of the world,'' said Mr. Geisenberger, the Delaware official. ''We will not support any changes that change the friendliness of American business and close our doors to capital formation and the ease of doing business.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Propelled by a torrent of blistering television advertisements, President Obama is successfully invoking Mitt Romney's career at Bain Capital to raise questions about Mr. Romney's commitment to the middle class, strategists in both parties say, as the candidates engage in a critical summer duel to set the terms for this fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite doubts among some centrist Democrats about the wisdom of attacking Mr. Romney's business career, millions of dollars in negative commercials painting him as a ruthless executive who pursued profits at the expense of jobs are starting to make an impact on undecided voters in swing states, according to strategists from both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategists agree that the ads are having an effect but differ on whether Mr. Romney is suffering any substantial damage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the sense of worry and alarm that has hung over the White House for weeks is dissipating, and with his supporters relieved by the Supreme Court decision on Thursday to uphold most of his health care law, Mr. Obama faces new challenges in the period from now to the conventions at the end of the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People close to the Romney campaign say it could close its June fund-raising books having collected an additional $100 million, possibly more, a tally that would exceed all expectations and further extend the overall Republican financial advantage in the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that cash influx, Mr. Romney's team is preparing a new advertising campaign that will aggressively portray Mr. Obama as a craven political figure, rather than the transformative leader he pledged to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They began that effort in the past several days with a new ad that uses video of Hillary Rodham Clinton lashing out at Mr. Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary campaign as spending ''millions of dollars perpetuating falsehoods.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides said they were considering more ads with Mrs. Clinton or her husband criticizing Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He's just another politician,'' Matt Rhoades, the campaign manager for Mr. Romney, said in an interview. ''He's not the Barack Obama of the last campaign.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. Obama's aides acknowledged that, whatever they do, they still must contend with a troubled economy, with monthly reminders in the unemployment and job creation reports, the next of which comes out on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's aides said in interviews that their strategy depends on keeping their candidate close to Mr. Obama in the polls until at least the Republican convention at the end of August. They hope to then begin to pull away with a relentless case that Mr. Obama has not been up to the job of fixing the economy -- and that Mr. Romney has the experience and know-how to lead the nation to recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have studiously avoided getting drawn into what they have called side issues. And at times they have limited Mr. Romney's media appearances, even after the health care decision, which conservatives believe will help motivate voters who now see electing Mr. Romney as the only chance to repeal the health law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Romney's strategy of avoiding clashes on issues other than the economy and minimizing his risks -- he has no public events scheduled until the Fourth of July -- is starting to draw criticism even from some fellow Republicans, who are urging him to take more specific stands and set out a more positive agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, by contrast, has put other big issues in front of the nation on his terms, most notably same-sex marriage and illegal immigration, displaying the advantages of incumbency, energizing crucial voting groups and moving public attention at least temporarily away from jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even as they have tried to expand the playing field of issues, Mr. Obama's aides said they would not let up on their efforts to challenge the core of Mr. Romney's campaign, his claim to be a better economic manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We've got to make sure people fully appreciate Mitt Romney is not some safe alternative,'' said David Plouffe, a senior adviser to the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To drive home that point over the past few weeks, Mr. Obama has gone on an advertising binge, spending more than $12 million during a single week in mid-June, according to a Republican group that monitors advertising spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the independent media tracking firm CMAG, between early April and late June Mr. Obama spent at least $40 million and Mr. Romney at least $10 million, with outside groups like Crossroads GPS and Restore Our Future making up the difference for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest advertisement against Mr. Romney has been criticized by independent fact-checkers as incorrectly calling Mr. Romney a corporate raider and unfairly alleging that he ''shipped jobs to China and Mexico.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's acute focus on Bain has drawn complaints from Democrats, including high-profile surrogates like Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark, who said in May that he found the attacks nauseating. And some Democrats say they have concluded that the attacks are not working, anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But recent Quinnipiac University polls found slight shifts in Mr. Obama's favor on the question of who would do a better job handling the economy in Ohio, and that he was roughly even with Mr. Romney on the question in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 33 percent of swing state respondents said that hearing or reading about Mr. Romney's business record had made them view him more negatively, as opposed to 18 percent who said it made them view him more favorably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And strategists with both parties said independent voters speaking in focus groups had indicated that they had seen the ads or heard their charges and that they had raised questions in their minds about Mr. Romney's past experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who ran Senator John McCain's presidential campaign in 2008, said the attacks on Mr. Romney's business experience appear to have resulted in a ''fairly mild increase in disapproval ratings.'' But, he said, ''It's not a huge rise over the course of a month.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And officials with Mr. Romney's campaign said that whatever questions the advertisements might have raised, they had not shifted opinions away from a general belief among swing voters that Mr. Romney is ''the guy to fix the economy'' and that he ''will actually get the job done,'' said Mr. Romney's pollster Neil Newhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important, they said, Mr. Romney remains in a statistical tie with Mr. Obama at a time when Mr. Romney is still recovering from his rough primary fight and scrambling to raise money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''As you start to put together a general election campaign, it's when an incumbent president should be at his strongest,'' said Stuart Stevens, a senior Romney strategist. ''They've been preparing for this moment for three and a half years, and we've been in a primary until very recently.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with the political terrain newly settled by the Supreme Court's decision, neither side expects the campaign to move beyond its dogfight status before the party conventions and the debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's going to be very close,'' Mr. Plouffe said in an interview. ''We're not looking for -- and don't expect -- seismic movement.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Can Mitt Romney be everything to everyone on immigration? <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October, 1999, as George W. Bush prepared for the Republican presidential primaries, he took the unexpected step of denouncing a House Republican proposal to cut the Earned Income Tax Credit, a benefit for the working poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs of the poor,&quot; Bush declared, while campaigning in California. &quot;I'm concerned for someone who is moving from near-poverty to middle class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bill Clinton was preparing for the Democratic presidential primaries in 1992, he challenged the liberal wing of his own party over and over again. He declared that he would &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot;; he sanctioned the execution in Arkansas of Ricky Ray Rector, a mentally disabled murderer; and he denounced the appearance at a conference sponsored by Jesse Jackson ofSister Souljah, a political activist and rapper who had become notorious for her comments in the wake of the riots in Los Angeles earlier that year: &quot;If black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush and Clinton, both of whom went on to win two terms in the White House, dealt head-on with one of the most difficult problems presidential candidates face: How to address issues which divide the candidate's core constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Mitt Romney faces a similar dilemma: the issue of immigration. In this case, Romney's choice has been to avoid making a choice; he is trying to have it both ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration is a complicated problem for Romney because the issue pits hard-core anti-immigration forces on the right against two distinct constituencies: Hispanic voters; and the business wing of the Republican party, which wants legal access to the services of millions of low-wage workers. All three groups are crucial to Romney. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By ducking the issue, Romney may be taking what seems like the safest route, but equivocation carries its own liabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps most dangerously, Romney makes himself vulnerable to the same charge of failed leadership that he has frequently leveled against Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration issue surfaced on June 15 when the Obama administration announced its new enforcement policy, which exempts from deportation young, undocumented but law-abiding people brought to the United States before the age of 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days after the Obama announcement, Romney appeared on &quot;Face The Nation&quot; on CBS where Bob Schieffer asked him, &quot;Just to make sure I understand, would you leave this&quot; - the Obama policy - &quot;in place while you worked out a long-term solution or would you just repeal it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney replied:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll - we'll look at that - we'll look at that setting as we - as we reach that. But my anticipation is, I'd come into office and say we need to get this done on a long-term basis, not this kind of a stopgap measure. What the president did, he should have worked on this years ago. If he felt seriously about this, he should have taken action when he had a Democrat House and Senate, but he didn't. He saves these sorts of things until four and a half months before the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full interview is worth reading. Schieffer is courteous but persistent. Romney's performance is consistently evasive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 25, shortly after the Supreme Court released its decision on the constitutionality of Arizona's tough immigration law - headline news across the country - the Romney campaign issued the following statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's decision underscores the need for a President who will lead on this critical issue and work in a bipartisan fashion to pursue a national immigration strategy. President Obama has failed to provide any leadership on immigration. This represents yet another broken promise by this President. I believe that each state has the duty - and the right - to secure our borders and preserve the rule of law, particularly when the federal government has failed to meet its responsibilities. As Candidate Obama, he promised to present an immigration plan during his first year in office.&nbsp; But four years later, we are still waiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement was worthy of the famous 1980 headline in the Boston Globe describing a speech by President Jimmy Carter: &quot;More Mush From the Wimp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later on the 25th, Romney told a group of donors in Scottsdale, Ariz. that he would have &quot;preferred to see the Supreme Court give more latitude to the states, not less.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal commentators have had a field day carving up Romney's equivocations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salon's Alex Seitz-Wald summed it up well in a story headlined &quot;Romney plays immigration dodgeball: A comprehensive guide to everything Romney has refused to say about immigration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think Progress's Igor Volsky continued the full court press: &quot;Romney's Campaign Co-Chair Spends Four Minutes Dodging Direct Questions On Arizona Immigration Law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign dismisses sniping from the left, but perhaps they took note of a tweet from Mark Levin, the right-wing talk show host: &quot;Romney on illegal immigration and Arizona's law - weak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levin read Romney's statement aloud on his radio show, then said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here we are in the face of tyranny, a president of the United States acting outside immigration statutes, acting outside the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine, flipping the bird to the Supreme Court - this is the best he could do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W. James Antle, of the conservative American Spectator, published a blog post, &quot;Pinning Romney Down on Arizona,&quot; that reprinted a lengthy, agonized effort by Rick Gorka, a Romney spokesman, to explain his boss's position. It is worth reading in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is a key exchange:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Does [Romney] support the law as it was drafted in Arizona?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gorka: The governor supports the right of states, that's all we're going to say on this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Does he have a position on the law, or no position?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gorka: The governor has his own immigration policy that he laid out in Orlando and in the primary, which he would implement as president, which would address this issue. Whereas Obama has had four years in the office and has yet to address it in a meaningful way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: But does the Governor have a position on the Arizona law besides supporting the right of states?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gorka: This debate is sprung from the president failing to address this issue, so each state is left and has the power to draft and enact their own immigration policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: But the Arizona law does very specific things, does the governor support those things that the Arizona law does?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gorka: We've addressed this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Republican primaries, in which almost no Hispanics vote, Romney declared himself Mr. Hardline on immigration. A Romney&nbsp;commercial titled &quot;Takes Guts&quot; told viewers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney. He said no to drivers' licenses for illegals, no to instate tuition, fought for English in the classroom. The only candidate with a proven record of fixing the big problems. From day one, Mitt Romney will do what he does best, take charge, demand results, no excuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, contemplating a general election contest in which millions of Hispanics will cast ballots, Romney has gone rubber-kneed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's commitment to the safe route is a core aspect of his political style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an unusual moment of candor last April, Romney explained his rationale for caution to Stephen F. Hayes of the conservative Weekly Standard:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the things I found in a short campaign against Ted Kennedy was that when I said, for instance, that I wanted to eliminate the Department of Education, that was used to suggest I don't care about education. So I think it's important for me to point out that I anticipate that there will be departments and agencies that will either be eliminated or combined with other agencies. So for instance, I anticipate that housing vouchers will be turned over to the states rather than be administered at the federal level, and so at this point I think of the programs to be eliminated or to be returned to the states, and we'll see what consolidation opportunities exist as a result of those program eliminations. So will there be some that get eliminated or combined? The answer is yes, but I'm not going to give you a list right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney also told Hayes exactly why he believes his evasive tactics will work:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing I can assure you is that the one group that will certainly be with me in the general election if I'm the nominee will be conservatives and very conservatives. Because they're certainly not going to vote for Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney is right that conservatives will not be pulling Democratic levers, but there is no guarantee that they will turn out in the numbers he needs. A June 7-12 Pew survey showed that lukewarm backing could prove to be a serious problem for Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Obama backers support him strongly, while most Romney voters support him only moderately. Similarly, Democrats are more satisfied with the choice of candidates than are Republicans: 68% of Democratic voters say they are satisfied with the field compared with 60% of Republican voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, while the survey found that Obama held a modest 50-46 lead over Romney, the percentage of voters who &quot;strongly&quot; back Obama, 30 percent, was nearly twice the 17 percent who strongly support Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although poll data does not specifically link Romney's vacillation on immigration to the lack of enthusiasm for his bid, it is virtually certain that a reluctance to take a stand is not an effective tool for building voter intensity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's stance - or lack thereof - speaks in part to his character, but more significantly it speaks to the slow-motion struggle within the Republican Party about coming to terms with the fact that its white base is shrinking while Hispanics, as a proportion of the electorate, are steadily gaining traction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this respect, Romney's fears of taking a more pro-immigrant stance - a posture roughly 90 percent of Republican strategists I have spoken with believe is essential - are possibly realistic. George W. Bush ran in 2004 on a platform calling for liberal immigration reform, winning a higher percentage of Hispanic votes than his Republican predecessors while simultaneously maintaining the backing of socially conservative whites. Romney lacks Bush's glad-handing charm, his gift for electioneering. Bush's comfort with the cadence&nbsp;and rhetoric of&nbsp;the southern vernacular gave him leeway with low- and middle-income whites, leeway Romney may sense he does not have.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Summertime for presidential candidates means taking advantage of the long, hot weeks before the party conventions kick the campaign into high gear. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Fourth of July holiday week provides an initial peek into the strategies of President Obama and Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama will take the first half of the week off and then travel through Ohio and Pennsylvania on a two-day bus tour. Mr. Romney is taking the full week off, except for a brief appearance at a Fourth of July parade near his vacation home in New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not taking a break are the television advertisements from both campaigns, which are continuing to accelerate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are the particulars of the candidates' week ahead:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OBAMA The president and his family will start the week at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland before returning to the White House for the holiday on Wednesday. Mr. Obama will host members of the military for a Fourth of July picnic on the White House lawn - one of the perks of incumbency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the relaxation ends on Thursday, when Mr. Obama begins the bus tour through Ohio, with a stop in western Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential trip follows Mr. Romney's recent five-day bus tour, and it highlights Mr. Obama's focus on battleground states like Ohio. It is also intended to get the president out of the formal confines of the West Wing to make a closer connection with the voting public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has long complained about feeling stifled and disconnected from the public in Washington. The campaign, and especially the bus tour, helps avoid the kind of &quot;Rose Garden isolation&quot; that his campaign fears will feed an impression that he does not understand the economic plight of struggling Americans. Aides said the tour would focus on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing to watch for: on Friday, while Mr. Obama is on the road, the government will issue the jobs and unemployment reports for June. The timing will give the president a real-world backdrop when he reacts to the numbers - a better image than the blue curtains of the White House briefing room, where he said last month that the &quot;private sector is doing fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROMNEY Every summer, Mr. Romney's extended family gathers at his vacation home on a lake in Wolfeboro, N.H., for a week of competitive sports and private time. (They call it the &quot;Romney Olympics,&quot; according to The Washington Post.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A presidential campaign apparently does not get in the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking this week off is probably good timing. Voters are likely to be paying more attention to their barbecue grills than their television sets as they celebrate the holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the weeklong break also fits in with Mr. Romney's overall campaign strategy of trying to keep the focus on the president's record - not his own. Aides say they believe that voters in November will harshly judge Mr. Obama's handling of the economy over the last three and a half years. Staying off the campaign trail, except for the brief appearance at the parade in Wolfeboro, will ensure that Mr. Romney will not say or do anything that might get in the way of that message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One curious question is how Mr. Romney plans to respond to the jobs report on Friday. It would seem an odd choice for him to comment on the news with his six-bedroom home on 13 acres as a backdrop. Mr. Romney could change his plans and travel to a small business or another location. The campaign has not said what its plans are for Friday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama and his Democratic allies love to tweak Mitt Romney with unflattering quotations from his rivals in the primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Mr. Romney has returned the favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An advertisement running in Ohio accuses the president of lying about Mr. Romney's record, and it uses a clip of Hillary Rodham Clinton from the 2008 Democratic presidential primary race to drive home the point. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That's Barack Obama,'' the narrator says. ''He also attacked Hillary Clinton with vicious lies.'' The ad then shows a 2008 clip of Mrs. Clinton complaining about the negative ads that Mr. Obama ran against her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He continues to spend millions of dollars perpetuating falsehoods,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''So shame on you, Barack Obama.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Kantar Media, which tracks ad spending, the spot is running in the Dayton area, where Mrs. Clinton trounced Mr. Obama in the state's 2008 primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a classic version of an old political technique: using criticism from members of a candidate's own party. In the case of Mrs. Clinton, now Mr. Obama's secretary of state, it could be particularly effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is part of a broader effort by Mr. Romney's campaign to undermine the edge the president has in likability. Aides to Mr. Romney are eager to suggest that Mr. Obama's campaign is ruthless and that the candidate will say anything to get elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama has the ultimate defense if the ad starts to gain traction. Having made Mrs. Clinton a member of his cabinet -- and her agreeing to join -- makes it harder to argue that she still holds a grudge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And despite her role in a traditionally nonpartisan job, she might be moved to respond to the ad in a way that could erode its effectiveness. MICHAEL D. SHEAR</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battle over President Obama's health-care law, settled as a legal matter by the Supreme Court, reopened in the political arena Friday, as Republicans sought to rebound by refocusing the debate on Obama's stewardship of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stung by the court's decision to uphold the law, the GOP zeroed in on the portion of the ruling that justified the constitutionality of the individual mandate by casting it as a tax, within Congress's authority. Republicans argue that the measure represents a massive tax hike on the middle class that will stunt job growth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court has declared that President Obama can have the federal government use its powers of taxation to compel behavior, and that's one of the most frightening legal aspects of this decision,&quot; Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said in a conference call with reporters that was arranged by the Republican National Committee. &quot;It really raises the question, what's next? Taxes on people that refuse to eat tofu or refuse to drive a Chevy Volt?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks drew a sharp response from the White House. In a memo to Capitol Hill Democrats, titled &quot;Winning the Middle Class Tax Battle,&quot; Obama's senior adviser, David Plouffe, insisted that the health-care law will lower costs for millions of families. He cited projections estimating that less than 1 percent of the population would forgo health insurance and may be subject to federal penalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans in Washington are trying to deliberately misrepresent the President's record of cutting taxes for the middle class,&quot; Plouffe wrote. &quot;We welcome this debate . . . and we urge you to seize this opportunity to go on offense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The back-and-forth suggested that health care will continue to resonate into the fall, with both sides rallying their troops with extensive fundraising appeals and new television advertisements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney's presidential campaign reported that it raised more than $4 million in the 24 hours after the ruling, which has mobilized grass-roots conservative activists who had been cool on Romney in the GOP primary. And American Crossroads, a conservative super PAC, announced that it will launch a national ad campaign on cable television hitting Obama on the health-care ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now it's official: Obama increased taxes on struggling families. The middle class takes another hit,&quot; the ad says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party is betting that November 2012 will be a redux of November 2010, when backlash against the health-care law helped sweep a wave of tea party Republicans into the House, delivering the speakership to Rep. John A. Boehner (Ohio).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the Supreme Court's ruling may have awakened a sleeping giant,&quot; said Ron Christie, a Republican strategist. &quot;Obama may have won the battle in the Supreme Court, but the war is yet to be waged for November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said that the president's reelection team also enjoyed a surge in fundraising after the health-care ruling, though he declined to be specific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an fundraising e-mail on Friday, senior campaign adviser David Axelrod recalled his daughter Lauren's near-fatal battle with epilepsy that began 30 years ago and, he said, nearly bankrupted his family because of their &quot;lousy&quot; health insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was moved to tears when the Supreme Court affirmed the Affordable Care Act, because I know that other families won't have to face the terror and heartache we knew,&quot; Axelrod said. The seizures continued for 18 years, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate also resonated on the state level, with Jindal and several other Republican governors announcing that they would not move to implement parts of the law until after the election, in hopes that Obama would lose and the act could be repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to do everything we can here in this swing state to help elect a new Senate and help elect a new president in four months,&quot; Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell said during the RNC conference call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But swing-state Democrats said they would not shy away from engaging the GOP and did not fear losing votes among independents who might be cool to Obama's legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to be a great issue anytime you have such a clear contrast,&quot; said Chris Redfern, Democratic Party chairman of Ohio, where Obama will launch a two-day bus tour next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our side is standing up for breast cancer survivors and young people who have lost a job and do not have health care,&quot; Redfern said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats also said they would continue to remind voters that Romney, while governor of Massachusetts, authored a health-care law that was the template for Obama's legislation and included a penalty for those who choose not to purchase health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That will make it difficult for Romney to embrace the Republican attack line that the law represents a tax hike, Democrats said. On the campaign trail, Romney has called the legislation a &quot;job killer,&quot; hoping to wrap health care into his overall message on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think people recognize that if you want to replace Obamacare, you've got to replace President Obama, and the urgency of doing that is galvanizing people across the county,&quot; Romney said at a fundraiser in New York on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You look at his policies and ask whether they are helping the economy and helping the recovery or hurting it,&quot; he said. &quot;This piece of legislation, does it help create jobs or does it kill jobs? Ask employers, ask small employers in particular.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court has declared that President Obama can have the federal government use its powers of taxation to compel behavior, and that's one of the most frightening legal aspects of this decision,&quot; Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said in a conference call with reporters that was arranged by the Republican National Committee. &quot;It really raises the question, what's next? Taxes on people that refuse to eat tofu or refuse to drive a Chevy Volt?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks drew a sharp response from the White House. In a memo to Capitol Hill Democrats, titled &quot;Winning the Middle Class Tax Battle,&quot; Obama's senior adviser, David Plouffe, insisted that the health-care law will lower costs for millions of families. He cited projections estimating that less than 1 percent of the population would forgo health insurance and may be subject to federal penalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans in Washington are trying to deliberately misrepresent the President's record of cutting taxes for the middle class,&quot; Plouffe wrote. &quot;We welcome this debate . . . and we urge you to seize this opportunity to go on offense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The back-and-forth suggested that health care will continue to resonate into the fall, with both sides rallying their troops with extensive fundraising appeals and new television advertisements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney's presidential campaign reported that it raised more than $4 million in the 24 hours after the ruling, which has mobilized grass-roots conservative activists who had been cool on Romney in the GOP primary. And American Crossroads, a conservative super PAC, announced that it will launch a national ad campaign on cable television hitting Obama on the health-care ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now it's official: Obama increased taxes on struggling families. The middle class takes another hit,&quot; the ad says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party is betting that November 2012 will be a redux of November 2010, when backlash against the health-care law helped sweep a wave of tea party Republicans into the House, delivering the speakership to Rep. John A. Boehner (Ohio).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the Supreme Court's ruling may have awakened a sleeping giant,&quot; said Ron Christie, a Republican strategist. &quot;Obama may have won the battle in the Supreme Court, but the war is yet to be waged for November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said that the president's reelection team also enjoyed a surge in fundraising after the health-care ruling, though he declined to be specific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an fundraising e-mail on Friday, senior campaign adviser David Axelrod recalled his daughter Lauren's near-fatal battle with epilepsy that began 30 years ago and, he said, nearly bankrupted his family because of their &quot;lousy&quot; health insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was moved to tears when the Supreme Court affirmed the Affordable Care Act, because I know that other families won't have to face the terror and heartache we knew,&quot; Axelrod said. The seizures continued for 18 years, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate also resonated on the state level, with Jindal and several other Republican governors announcing that they would not move to implement parts of the law until after the election, in hopes that Obama would lose and the act could be repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to do everything we can here in this swing state to help elect a new Senate and help elect a new president in four months,&quot; Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell said during the RNC conference call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But swing-state Democrats said they would not shy away from engaging the GOP and did not fear losing votes among independents who might be cool to Obama's legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to be a great issue anytime you have such a clear contrast,&quot; said Chris Redfern, Democratic Party chairman of Ohio, where Obama will launch a two-day bus tour next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our side is standing up for breast cancer survivors and young people who have lost a job and do not have health care,&quot; Redfern said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats also said they would continue to remind voters that Romney, while governor of Massachusetts, authored a health-care law that was the template for Obama's legislation and included a penalty for those who choose not to purchase health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That will make it difficult for Romney to embrace the Republican attack line that the law represents a tax hike, Democrats said. On the campaign trail, Romney has called the legislation a &quot;job killer,&quot; hoping to wrap health care into his overall message on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think people recognize that if you want to replace Obamacare, you've got to replace President Obama, and the urgency of doing that is galvanizing people across the county,&quot; Romney said at a fundraiser in New York on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You look at his policies and ask whether they are helping the economy and helping the recovery or hurting it,&quot; he said. &quot;This piece of legislation, does it help create jobs or does it kill jobs? Ask employers, ask small employers in particular.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld President Obama's health care overhaul law, saying its requirement that most Americans obtain insurance or pay a penalty was authorized by Congress's power to levy taxes. The vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joining the court's four more liberal members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was a victory for Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats, affirming the central legislative achievement of Mr. Obama's presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Affordable Care Act's requirement that certain individuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax,'' Chief Justice Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. ''Because the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the court rejected the argument that the administration had pressed most vigorously in support of the law, that its individual mandate was justified by Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. The vote was again 5 to 4, but in this instance Chief Justice Roberts and the court's four more conservative members were in agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court also substantially limited the law's expansion of Medicaid, the joint federal-state program that provides health care to poor and disabled people. Seven justices agreed that Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority by coercing states into participating in the expansion by threatening them with the loss of existing federal payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who had been thought to be the administration's best hope to provide a fifth vote to uphold the law, joined three more conservative members in an unusual jointly written dissent that said the court should have struck down the entire law. The majority's approach, he said from the bench, ''amounts to a vast judicial overreaching.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court's ruling was the most significant federalism decision since the New Deal and the most closely watched case since Bush v. Gore in 2000. It was a crucial milestone for the law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, allowing almost all -- and perhaps, in the end, all -- of its far-reaching changes to roll forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama welcomed the court's decision on the health care law, which has inspired fierce protests, legal challenges and vows of repeal since it was passed. ''Whatever the politics, today's decision was a victory for people all over this country whose lives are more secure because of this law,'' he said at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans, though, used the occasion to attack it again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Obamacare was bad policy yesterday; it's bad policy today,'' Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in remarks near the Capitol. ''Obamacare was bad law yesterday; it's bad law today.'' He, like Congressional Republicans, renewed his pledge to undo the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The historic decision, coming after three days of lively oral arguments in March and in the midst of a presidential campaign, drew intense attention across the nation. Outside the court, more than 1,000 people gathered -- packing the sidewalk, playing music, chanting slogans -- and a loud cheer went up as word spread that the law had been largely upheld. Chants of ''Yes we can!'' rang out, but the ruling also provoked disappointment among Tea Party supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Loudoun County, Va., Angela Laws, 58, the owner of a cleaning service, said she and her fiance were relieved at the news. ''We laughed, and we shouted with joy and hugged each other,'' she said, explaining that she had been unable to get insurance because of her diabetes and back problems until a provision in the health care law went into effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of uncertainty about the law's fate, the court's ruling provides some clarity -- and perhaps an alert -- to states, insurers, employers and consumers about what they are required to do by 2014, when much of the law comes into force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration had argued that the mandate was necessary because it allowed other provisions of the law to function: those overhauling the way insurance is sold and those preventing sick people from being denied or charged extra for insurance. The mandate's supporters had said it was necessary to ensure that not only sick people but also healthy individuals would sign up for coverage, keeping insurance premiums more affordable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives took comfort from two parts of the decision: the new limits it placed on federal regulation of commerce and on the conditions the federal government may impose on money it gives the states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five justices accepted the argument that had been at the heart of the challenges brought by 26 states and other plaintiffs: that the federal government is not permitted to force individuals not engaged in commercial activities to buy services they do not want. That was a stunning victory for a theory pressed by a small band of conservative and libertarian lawyers. Most members of the legal academy view the theory as misguided,if not frivolous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''To an economist, perhaps, there is no difference between activity and inactivity; both have measurable economic effects on commerce,'' Chief Justice Roberts wrote. ''But the distinction between doing something and doing nothing would not have been lost on the framers, who were practical statesmen, not metaphysical philosophers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in an opinion joined by Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, dissented on this point, calling the view ''stunningly retrogressive.'' She wondered why Chief Justice Roberts had seen fit to address it at all in light of his vote to uphold the mandate under the tax power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akhil Reed Amar, a Yale law professor and a champion of the health care law, said that it was ''important to look at the dark cloud behind the silver lining.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Federal power has more restrictions on it,'' he said, referring to the new limits on regulating commerce. ''Going forward, there may even be laws on the books that have to be re-examined.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restrictions placed on the Medicaid expansion may also have significant ripple effects. A splintered group of justices effectively revised the law to allow states to choose between participating in the expansion while receiving additional payments or forgoing the expansion and retaining the existing payments. The law had called for an all-or-nothing choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expansion had been designed to provide coverage to 17 million Americans. While some states have indicated that they will participate in the expansion, others may be resistant, leaving more people outside the safety net than the Obama administration had intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the decision did not turn on it, the back-and-forth between Justice Ginsburg's opinion for the four liberals and the joint opinion by the four conservatives -- Justice Kennedy and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. -- revisited the by-now-familiar arguments. Broccoli made a dozen appearances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Although an individual might buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day, there is no certainty she will ever do so,'' Justice Ginsburg wrote. ''And if she eventually wants a car or has a craving for broccoli, she will be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nourishment. She will get no free ride or food, at the expense of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conservative dissenters responded that ''one day the failure of some of the public to purchase American cars may endanger the existence of domestic automobile manufacturers; or the failure of some to eat broccoli may be found to deprive them of a newly discovered cancer-fighting chemical which only that food contains, producing health care costs that are a burden on the rest of us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the justices agreed that their review of the health care law was not barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, which allows suits over some sorts of taxes only after they become due. That could have delayed the health care challenge to 2015. The conservative dissenters said that the majority could not have it both ways by calling the mandate a tax for some purposes but not others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That carries verbal wizardry too far, deep into the forbidden land of sophists,'' they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a general matter, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the decision in the case, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, No. 11-393, offered no endorsement of the law's wisdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some decisions, the chief justice said, ''are entrusted to our nation's elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Ginsburg, speaking to a crowded courtroom that sat rapt for the better part of an hour, drew a different conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In the end,'' she said, ''the Affordable Care Act survives largely unscathed.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no underestimating the importance of the Supreme Court decision upholding most of the health reform law -- politically, constitutionally and in terms of its practical effects on the nation and the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These effects were clear from the moment the decision was announced Thursday morning, but the constitutional picture was more complex. The way the decision was framed could make it harder for Congress to pass laws based on the Constitution's commerce clause, which has been at the foundation of some of the most momentous laws and court rulings in American history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLITICS AND PERSONALITY The court decision was a huge victory for President Obama at a critical time. The White House has been living for months in dread of the possibility that this increasingly conservative Supreme Court would reverse Mr. Obama's signature policy achievement just a few months before the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House will still be challenged by the inevitable Republican vote in the House to repeal the law outright, and by the need to counter the spin, which started developing within hours of the Supreme Court ruling, that the way the court framed its decision made it clear that the health care reform is just another tax on the middle class. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling was a loss for Mitt Romney, who was left fumbling for a cogent response, and will leave him even more vulnerable to attempts by Mr. Obama to remind Americans that, when he was governor of Massachusetts, he championed a health care reform that looks very much like Mr. Obama's law. Mr. Romney's argument, that his reform was right for one state but Washington does not have the power to impose it on the other 49, was refuted by the Supreme Court ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision also said a lot about Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., who was considered by many moderates and liberals to be a highly partisan actor dedicated not just to a conservative judicial philosophy but to the political aims of the right wing of the Republican Party. That image was changed in preliminary ways by a week that began with his unqualified agreement to the opinion striking down three provisions of Arizona's draconian anti-immigrant law and ended with the health care ruling, the most important decision by the court in many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE PRACTICAL IMPACT In general, the decision means that tens of millions more Americans will have access to affordable health insurance and that reforms in how medical care is delivered and paid for can be aggressively pursued to bring down the cost of health care. Most of the changes will take effect in 2014, like coverage for adults with pre-existing conditions. Many popular provisions are already in effect, including mandated coverage of pre-existing conditions in children and allowing parents to keep their children on their coverage until they are 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law covers preventive care without cost-sharing by Medicare patients and improves preventive care coverage in private plans. It bans insurers from imposing lifetime limits on how much they will pay for an individual's care. The law is already providing grants to carry out demonstrations and pilot projects to encourage hospitals, physicians and insurers to coordinate care, eliminate waste and reduce medical errors. These initiatives will now be accelerated in coming years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major exception to the strong legal endorsement of the law involves Medicaid. The law called for states to expand their Medicaid coverage to virtually everyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or up to $25,390 for a family of three. It encouraged states to expand their programs by having Washington pay 100 percent of the cost of newly eligible enrollees for three years, with the subsidy decreasing after that to 90 percent. But it also contained an implied threat to withdraw all federal financing for Medicaid if a state refused to expand. By a 7-to-2 vote, the court said that was too coercive and upheld only the provision of additional funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We disagreed with the court's legal reasoning on this point and believe that without the possibility of withdrawing federal funds, the reform law may fall short of ensuring near-universal coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE CONSTITUTIONAL FALLOUT When Congress was struggling to pass the health care bill, lawmakers refused to use the word tax to describe the proposed penalties on those who did not obtain insurance. Instead, they used the words ''mandate'' and ''penalty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration went along with this purely political pretense but made a cogent argument to the Supreme Court that the taxing power was a strong ground for the law, and it sensibly carried the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Justice Roberts deserves substantial credit for joining the court's moderate-liberals in finding the mandate constitutional on that basis -- and for sparing the country a spasm of outrage. Had he gone the other way, the ruling would have been seen as an endorsement of Mr. Romney. Chief Justice Roberts can hardly be painted as an Obama partisan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when he summarized his opinion from the bench on Thursday, he explained that he found the individual mandate unconstitutional under the commerce clause -- like the four other conservatives whose joint dissent said they would have struck down the law entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His said that rather than regulating ''existing commercial activity,'' the mandate ''compels individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product.'' Upholding the provision under the commerce clause would ''justify a mandatory purchase to solve almost any problem,'' he wrote, and that would change ''the relation between the citizen and the federal government.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg answered the chief justice in a dissent on this issue for the four moderate liberals. ''Unlike the market for almost any other product or service,'' she wrote, ''the market for medical care is one in which all individuals inevitably participate.'' Virtually everyone has a need for care eventually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventy-five years of commerce-clause precedent dictated a presumption that the law was constitutional on that basis -- without a ''plain showing'' that Congress acted irrationally in passing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Ginsburg was right that the chief justice relied ''on a newly minted constitutional doctrine'' to strike down the mandate under the commerce clause, one with no ''home in the text of the Constitution or our decisions.'' An individual who chooses not to buy health insurance can be seen as choosing to self-insure -- clearly an activity in the marketplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics deluged the court's consideration of health care reform in the many briefs attacking the mandate and other parts of the law and in the intense three-day oral argument, when conservative justices asked questions that brought partisan politics sharply into the nation's highest courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, that did not keep the court from reaching the right result because Congress's taxing power is even greater than its power under the commerce clause. But the change gives conservatives a major -- if not fully understood -- tool in their campaign to limit Congress's efforts to solve problems with social and economic programs. This week's victory carries the potential of defeat in the future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama and his Democratic allies love to tweak Mitt Romney with unflattering quotations from his rivals in the primaries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Mr. Romney has returned the favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ad running in Ohio attacks the president for lying about Mr. Romney's record, and uses a clip of Hillary Rodham Clinton from the 2008 Democratic presidential primary race to drive home the point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's Barack Obama. He also attacked Hillary Clinton with vicious lies,&quot; the narrator says. The ad then shows a 2008 clip of Mrs. Clinton complaining about the negative ads Mr. Obama ran against her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He continues to spend millions of dollars perpetuating falsehoods,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said. &quot;So shame on you, Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Kantar Media, which tracks ad spending, the spot is running in the Dayton, Ohio, area - where Mrs. Clinton trounced Mr. Obama in the state's 2008 primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a classic version of an old political technique: using criticisms from members of a candidate's own party. In the case of Mrs. Clinton - now Mr. Obama's secretary of state - it could be particularly effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the ad is part of a broader effort by Mr. Romney's campaign to try to undermine the edge that the president has in likability. Aides to Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, are eager to suggest that Mr. Obama's campaign is ruthless and that the candidate will say anything to get elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will it work? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign is hoping to capitalize on the fact that Mrs. Clinton is popular with women and swing voters - two groups that Mr. Romney will need to win the White House in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama has the ultimate defense if the ad starts gaining traction. Having made Mrs. Clinton a member of his cabinet - and her agreeing to join - makes it harder to argue that she still holds a grudge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And despite her role in a traditionally nonpartisan job, she might be moved to respond to the ad in a way that could undermine its effectiveness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1303 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy issues don't spark much excitement among voters, ranking below health care, education and the federal budget deficit - not to mention jobs and the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet those same voters are being flooded this year with campaign ads about energy policy. Particularly in presidential swing states, the airwaves are laden with messages boosting oil drilling and natural gas and hammering President Obama for his support of green energy. The Cleveland area alone has seen $2.7 million worth of energy-related ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disconnect between what voters say they care about and what they're seeing on TV lies in the money behind the ads, much of it coming from oil and gas interests. Those funders get the double benefit of attacking Obama at the same time they are promoting their industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats also have spent millions on the subject, defending the president's record and linking Republican candidate Mitt Romney to Big Oil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, more than $41 million, about one in four of the dollars spent on broadcast advertising in the presidential campaign, has gone to ads mentioning energy, more than a host of other subjects and just as much as health care, according to ad-tracking firm Kantar Media/Cmag.          Much to gain or lose          In a campaign focused heavily on jobs and the economy, all of this focus on energy seems a bit off topic. But the stakes are high for energy producers and environmentalists, who are squared off over how much the government should regulate the industry. And attention has been heightened by a recent boom in production using new technologies such as fracking and horizontal drilling, as well as a spike in gas prices this spring just as the general-election campaign got underway.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked whether energy is important, more than half of voters say yes, according to recent polls. But asked to rank their top issues, fewer than 1 percent mention energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, so much spending focused on a topic low on the public agenda should not be a surprise, given the interest of the ad sponsors, said Bob Biersack, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's always been true that people's financial involvement in politics tends to reinforce their self-interest,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy debate coincides with a flurry of criticism of the Obama administration's loan guarantee for Solyndra, a solar-power company that became bankrupt and defaulted on more than $500 million. Among the company's investors was the family foundation of a major donor to Obama.&quot;Half a billion in taxpayer money gone, and Obama said this was a model of growth,&quot; says an ad from the conservative group Americans for Prosperity. &quot;Tell President Obama that workers aren't pawns in your political games.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt said the campaign welcomed the fight over the administration's energy policies, saying the president can win on the merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This debate has offered us the chance to highlight the success of the president's all-of-the-above energy strategy - domestic oil production at a 12-year high and our dependence on foreign oil at a 16-year low, domestic natural gas production at an all-time high and doubling our renewable energy production,&quot; LaBolt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are also attacking Obama for rejecting permits for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry oil from tar sands in Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Romney opened the general-election  campaign with an ad prominently featuring the Keystone issue, with the candidate saying he would reverse Obama and approve the pipeline on his first day in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Attacking the backers          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans for Prosperity, one of the major funders of the ads, has sponsored five television spots against Obama, two of them focused on Solyndra and another critical of government spending on clean energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization, which has promoted tea party candidates, has devoted more than 90 percent of its ad spending to energy-related commercials, according to Kantar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign and other Democrats have been critical of the group, saying, among other things, that its billionaire backers, brothers Charles and David Koch, are using it to promote the interests of the chemical conglomerate they own. David Koch is a founder and chairman of the organization. A Koch spokesman declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama answered Americans for Prosperity's message in his first ad of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secretive oil billionaires attacking President Obama with ads fact checkers say are not tethered to the facts,&quot; a narrator says in the spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, said the group focused on Solyndra because the firm's federal loan guarantee exemplifies cronyism and big government, with bureaucrats choosing economic winners and losers in the way they dole out public money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To us, Solyndra encapsulates everything that's wrong with the economic policies of President Obama,&quot; Phillips said. &quot;It's not just the energy, although the energy is important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also ran millions of dollars of advertising in 2009 and 2010 opposing the president's health-care plan, Phillips said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          'An agenda-setting effect'          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of these messages could very well do what their funders have in mind and shape public opinion, tarring renewable energy as a government boondoggle, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ads can create an agenda-setting effect and frame an issue,&quot; she said. &quot;If renewable energy comes to be seen as Solyndra, that's a problem for that sector, not simply for future government investment in that sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Energy Alliance, an advocacy group that pushes for less government regulation of the industry, spent $3.6 million this spring on an ad attacking Obama over gas prices, Solyndra, the Keystone pipeline and his opposition to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The ad includes a 2008 quote from Energy Secretary Steven Chu saying that, to drive down consumption, U.S. gas prices need to climb to the higher levels of Europe, comments he later reversed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Cole, a spokesman for the group, said it received most of its funding in its last tax year from individual families, including many with newfound wealth from domestic drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're now receiving impressive royalty checks because of the energy that's being produced on their land,&quot; Cole said, &quot;Those people are happy that organizations like ours are keeping the pressure on federal regulators in Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the groups whose singular focus in campaign ads has been energy is the American Petroleum Institute, a trade organization for oil companies. One of the ads depicts Obama on screen saying he will do &quot;whatever it takes to put this economy back on track.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He promised,&quot; a narrator says. &quot;Now's his chance. The Keystone XL pipeline is ready to be built. . . . It's all up to the president. Will he say yes to new jobs? Yes to economic growth?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the group, Eric Wohlschlegel, said the ad was not an attack on Obama but was meant to urge the president and Congress to approve the pipeline. He said his group is running &quot;nonpartisan, noncandidate ads to encourage Americans to make energy a ballot box issue in 2012.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent groups supporting Obama have joined the fight, linking Romney to the spending by energy interests. The League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, and the super PAC Priorities USA Action have spent $1 million on that effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big Oil has pledged $200 million to help Mitt Romney, and Romney's pledged to protect their profits and billions in special tax breaks,&quot; their ad states. &quot;So when you fill up your tank, remember who's in the tank for Big Oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Bain Capital's investments in companies that outsourced jobs used as a weapon against Mitt Romney.&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outsourcing has never been a popular term in the Western countries that lose jobs to emerging markets, but it has become positively toxic in the current United States presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new attack ad by President Barack Obama's campaign calls his presumptive opponent, Mitt Romney, the &quot;Outsourcer in Chief,&quot; The New York Times's Caucus blog writes. &quot;Romney's companies were pioneers at shipping U.S. jobs overseas,&quot; the ad says, &quot;investing in firms that specialized in relocating jobs done by American workers to new facilities in low-wage countries like China and India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The role of Bain Capital, the private equity firm Mr. Romney led, in the outsourcing business came into sharp focus after a Washington Post article last week listed various investments Bain made in companies that moved jobs out of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the nearly 15 years that Romney was actively involved in running Bain, a private equity firm that he founded, it owned companies that were pioneers in the practice of shipping work from the United States to overseas call centers and factories making computer components, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,&quot; the article said. While the article's first sentence mentions moving jobs to &quot;low-wage countries like China and India,&quot; it makes no further mention of India and refers mostly to manufacturing, not the services jobs in which India's outsourcing companies specialize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a fund-raiser in Atlanta, Mr. Obama derided Mr. Romney's advisers for trying to distinguish between 'off-shoring' and outsourcing,&quot; The New York Times wrote Tuesday.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll released on Wednesday suggests that in key swing states, President Obama's&nbsp;ad campaign against Mitt Romney is working. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While nationally the two rivals are locked in a dead heat, in 12 expected battleground states - Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin - Obama leads by eight points in the survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, what gives?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The obvious conclusion here is that the negative TV ads pummeling Romney in the battleground states . . . are having an impact,&quot; NBC's political unit wrote in its &quot;First Read&quot; morning briefing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data in the NBC-WSJ poll certainly back up that sentiment. A month ago in those same 12 swing states, Romney averaged a 36 percent favorable and 36 percent unfavorable rating. Now, he is at 30 percent favorable and 41 percent unfavorable. Attitudes about Romney's business background, a target of numerous ads run by the pro-Obama Priorities USA Action super PAC, are more negative in swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this attitude change seems to be happening despite the fact that Obama and his allies are being outspent by Romney and his allies on the air right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro-Obama groups are spending more than $9 million this week while pro-Romney groups are spending about $12 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notably, however, the bulk of the Democratic spending comes from Obama himself, whose campaign is spending nearly $8 million on ads this week. The rest comes from Priorities USA Action, which is spending about $1.2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's campaign, on the other hand, is spending a little under $3 million on ads while the rest of the GOP spending is spread among a multitude of outside groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future is spending about $4 million. The American Energy Alliance is spending $325,000 in Nevada to attack Obama's energy policy. The Koch-brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity is putting $2.85 million behind ads this week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means Romney can save his own cash for later in the race. But for now, Obama's&nbsp;ad blitz appears to be working.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany has been too cautious about putting its wealth behind the euro zone, World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick said Wednesday, warning that Berlin's reluctance is raising the risk that the region's financial problems will escalate into a wider crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoellick has consistently criticized European leaders as a group for failing to fix the problems in the 17-member currency union. But on the eve of his departure this week as head of the World Bank, he singled out Germany for criticism and said he worries that support for European integration is eroding in a country essential to the euro's success. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I take the German leaders at their word. I think they are sincere that their object is not to let [the euro] fail,&quot; Zoellick said. But &quot;the biggest risk is of miscalculation. So as Germany deals with the problem incrementally or plays brinksmanship or negotiates . . . that the snowball starts getting so big going down the hill that you can't stop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Germans have been too cautious. . . . They need to show they would be willing to provide assurances that Spain and Italy can fund themselves at reasonable rates,&quot; Zoellick said. He said efforts to stabilize the euro zone have proven &quot;ephemeral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoellick took over the World Bank five years ago as the agency was reeling from the departure of former president Paul Wolfowitz amid a controversy over his romantic relationship with a World Bank staffer. Soon after, Zoellick had to craft the bank's response to the world financial meltdown, which pushed the agency into less familiar territory, such as helping backstop European economies at risk of being pulled down by problems emanating from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a wide-ranging interview, Zoellick, 58, drew a stark contrast between the &quot;pragmatism&quot; he found among leaders of developing nations such as China and Brazil and the gridlock in Europe and the United States over both major and minor issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States &quot;there was a missed opportunity&quot; when leaders failed to act on the far-reaching recommendations of a bipartisan committee set up by President Obama to address the country's debt problems. He blamed Obama for the lack of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It won't happen unless the president of the United States does it,&quot; said Zoellick, a ranking trade and foreign policy official under Republican presidents who is considered a possible member of a Romney administration. &quot;The U.S. missed a moment, and if we had done something then, frankly we would have more standing internationally to help with Europe now. To be a key player we have get our own foundation in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also noted how smaller-bore policies that have been quickly taken up in developing countries - from job training strategies to devising programs for private money to build public infrastructure - have not found favor in richer nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I find around the world is a huge interest in education, training, workforce development. . . . In this country it is all locked down to student loans and who is ripping things off as opposed to let's see what models work,&quot; Zoellick said. &quot;The developing world is more pragmatic about using what works. . . . That does not mean they have it all right. They have their own challenges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoellick will be succeeded next week by former Dartmouth University president Jim Yong Kim.The World Bank announced Wednesday that Zoellick had accepted positions as a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, and as a visiting fellow at the D.C.-based Peterson Institute for International Economics.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he hopes to write and research the links between economics and global security problems, and to advise lawmakers on the country's longer-term budget problems.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the eve of the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's health-care law, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney predicted Wednesday that &quot;they're not sleeping real well at the White House tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the court's decision is a constitutional one, but that &quot;one thing we already know, however, we already know it's bad policy and it's gotta go.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's comments marked a shift in focus after several days in which his campaign  sought to deflect attacks from the Obama campaign over the role that Bain Capital, his former firm, played in the overseas outsourcing trend that accelerated in the 1990s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, Vice President Biden and top campaign operatives have seized on a Washington Post article published Friday that said Bain Capital invested in companies that specialized in moving work overseas. The Obama team released tough ads in the swing states of Iowa, Ohio and Virginia on the subject. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The language in the commercials went beyond the Post article by calling Romney himself an &quot;outsourcing pioneer&quot; and suggesting that the former Massachusetts governor would be the &quot;outsourcer in chief&quot; if elected. The article described some companies Bain invested in as &quot;pioneers in the practice of shipping work from the United States to overseas call centers and factories.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign has criticized the Post article, saying that none of the companies cited sent jobs overseas during Romney's tenure at the private-equity firm. He left in 1999. In material distributed to reporters on Wednesday, the campaign said that those companies added American jobs while Romney was at Bain and that their expanded overseas operations were aimed at supporting U.S. exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of the Romney campaign met with Post editors and asked for a retraction, but Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli said after the meeting that The Post is &quot;confident of its reporting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post article was based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which showed that Bain had invested in several firms that described their businesses as helping other companies shift work to or expand overseas. The practice of shifting some processes to other companies or countries that can do them more efficiently has become widespread in recent decades as firms seek to become more competitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The companies cited in the article - including Corporate Software, Stream International and Modus Media - emerged in the 1990s as specialists in the outsourcing of work and logistics for companies worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By investing in these companies, Bain was prescient. It caught an outsourcing wave that would transform the global economy, prove highly profitable for many firms and reduce prices for many consumers. But work opportunities for Americans in some industries would diminish as the trend accelerated, making the practice politically unpopular in many places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has spent the past two days in Virginia, a state that he said will pick the White House winner in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After speaking in Sterling, Romney met with Jim Wilson, a Virginia &quot;super fan&quot; who has spent the past year trailing the Republican's campaign. Wilson's white GMC pickup truck burst into flames last week, and the campaign donated a new white truck. Romney also gave Wilson an accessory for his travels: a fire extinguisher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he stood next to Romney, Wilson - in his trademark shorts and white socks - said: &quot;That's the trophy!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It won't happen unless the president of the United States does it,&quot; said Zoellick, a ranking trade and foreign policy official under Republican presidents who is considered a possible member of a Romney administration. &quot;The U.S. missed a moment, and if we had done something then, frankly we would have more standing internationally to help with Europe now. To be a key player we have get our own foundation in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also noted how smaller-bore policies that have been quickly taken up in developing countries - from job training strategies to devising programs for private money to build public infrastructure - have not found favor in richer nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I find around the world is a huge interest in education, training, workforce development. . . . In this country it is all locked down to student loans and who is ripping things off as opposed to let's see what models work,&quot; Zoellick said. &quot;The developing world is more pragmatic about using what works. . . . That does not mean they have it all right. They have their own challenges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoellick will be succeeded next week by former Dartmouth University president Jim Yong Kim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank announced Wednesday that Zoellick had accepted positions as a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, and as a visiting fellow at the D.C.-based Peterson Institute for International Economics.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he hopes to write and research the links between economics and global security problems, and to advise lawmakers on the country's longer-term budget problems.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the eve of the Supreme Court decision on President Obama's health-care law, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney predicted Wednesday that &quot;they're not sleeping real well at the White House tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the court's decision is a constitutional one, but that &quot;one thing we already know, however, we already know it's bad policy and it's gotta go.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's comments marked a shift in focus after several days in which his campaign  sought to deflect attacks from the Obama campaign over the role that Bain Capital, his former firm, played in the overseas outsourcing trend that accelerated in the 1990s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, Vice President Biden and top campaign operatives have seized on a Washington Post article published Friday that said Bain Capital invested in companies that specialized in moving work overseas. The Obama team released tough ads in the swing states of Iowa, Ohio and Virginia on the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The language in the commercials went beyond the Post article by calling Romney himself an &quot;outsourcing pioneer&quot; and suggesting that the former Massachusetts governor would be the &quot;outsourcer in chief&quot; if elected. The article described some companies Bain invested in as &quot;pioneers in the practice of shipping work from the United States to overseas call centers and factories.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign has criticized the Post article, saying that none of the companies cited sent jobs overseas during Romney's tenure at the private-equity firm. He left in 1999. In material distributed to reporters on Wednesday, the campaign said that those companies added American jobs while Romney was at Bain and that their expanded overseas operations were aimed at supporting U.S. exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of the Romney campaign met with Post editors and asked for a retraction, but Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli said after the meeting that The Post is &quot;confident of its reporting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post article was based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which showed that Bain had invested in several firms that described their businesses as helping other companies shift work to or expand overseas. The practice of shifting some processes to other companies or countries that can do them more efficiently has become widespread in recent decades as firms seek to become more competitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The companies cited in the article - including Corporate Software, Stream International and Modus Media - emerged in the 1990s as specialists in the outsourcing of work and logistics for companies worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By investing in these companies, Bain was prescient. It caught an outsourcing wave that would transform the global economy, prove highly profitable for many firms and reduce prices for many consumers. But work opportunities for Americans in some industries would diminish as the trend accelerated, making the practice politically unpopular in many places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has spent the past two days in Virginia, a state that he said will pick the White House winner in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After speaking in Sterling, Romney met with Jim Wilson, a Virginia &quot;super fan&quot; who has spent the past year trailing the Republican's campaign. Wilson's white GMC pickup truck burst into flames last week, and the campaign donated a new white truck. Romney also gave Wilson an accessory for his travels: a fire extinguisher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he stood next to Romney, Wilson - in his trademark shorts and white socks - said: &quot;That's the trophy!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATLANTA -- President Obama escalated his campaign's latest line of attack on Mitt Romney's business career on Tuesday, telling audiences at a series of fund-raising events that when it came to job creation, the former Massachusetts governor excelled more at creating them overseas than in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A news article last week about how Mr. Romney's old private equity firm moved jobs overseas prompted a carefully parsed response from the Romney camp. Seeking to capitalize on it, Mr. Obama -- and a team of campaign aides, operatives and surrogates -- took to the airwaves, microphones and the Internet to call his rival out of touch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a fund-raiser in Atlanta, Mr. Obama derided Mr. Romney's advisers for trying to distinguish between ''off-shoring'' and outsourcing. The president added cheerfully, ''I'm not kidding, that's what they said.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the audience laughed, he delivered his punch line: ''Those workers who lost their jobs, they don't know the difference.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over in the Romney camp, the response was swift and scathing. ''If President Obama had even half of Mitt Romney's record on jobs, he'd be running on it,'' Andrea Saul, a Romney spokeswoman, said in an e-mail statement. ''But President Obama has the worst record on jobs and the economy of any president in modern history, which is why he is running a campaign based on distractions, not solutions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney has been hurt by this line of attack in the past. During the early nominating contests, he struggled against criticisms like these on his record at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he co-founded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney aides vigorously dispute many of the assertions published in The Washington Post, which called Bain Capital ''pioneers'' of outsourcing, and are meeting with the newspaper on Wednesday to ask for a retraction. The campaign has said the ''fundamentally flawed'' article failed to distinguish between jobs outsourced to companies within America, jobs sent overseas and jobs created overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately, Romney aides said they were not too worried about the assaults on Bain. Their plan is to welcome any discussion that deals with Mr. Romney's business background, and simply refocus the conversation on what they believe is his strength: that his time in the private sector has prepared him to fix the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The backhanded side of this is a compliment -- that Romney's business acumen and history is relevant and is a legitimate credential,'' said an adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to talk more freely about the campaign's internal thinking. ''They're saying that his business background is something you ought to pay attention to, and on that level, we like it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Obama campaign seems to be scenting blood on the outsourcing issue, and Obama aides were hard at work calling attention to it. In Waterloo, Iowa, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called Mr. Romney ''a job creator -- in Singapore. And China. And India.'' His remarks were quickly posted on Twitter by the Obama campaign. Mr. Biden's attack prompted a quick rebuke from the Romney campaign, which sent an e-mail to reporters saying that Mr. Biden was trying to ''distract voters from the president's disastrous economic record.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign also unveiled new TV ads in three swing states, which accuse Mr. Romney of being a possible ''Outsourcer in Chief.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the 30-second ads, showing in Iowa and Virginia, focus on the Washington Post article. The third ad, in Ohio, takes a page out of Mr. Romney's playbook by demonizing China, much as Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, has been doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Romney's never stood up to China,'' the ad says. ''All he's done is send them our jobs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama was closing out a two-day, high-intensity fund-raising swing that took him to four states and that should raise up to $5 million, aides said. In Atlanta, he attended two fund-raisers before flying to Miami for two more, including one featuring the Latin music star Marc Anthony. But even as Mr. Obama was hauling in the cash to Democratic coffers, he warned Democrats that they were facing a fund-raising behemoth in the form of Republican ''super PAC'' donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one event, the president began, ''You've got Mr. Romney,'' only to be interrupted by boos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''No,'' Mr. Obama continued, as if he did not like the idea of people booing the man he was about to criticize, ''Mr. Romney is a patriotic American, he's got a beautiful family, he's been very successful all his life.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, having dispensed with the perfunctory praise, Mr. Obama launched into all the reasons not to vote for Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, appearing Tuesday in Salem, Va., kept the focus on the president's record, and offered a preview of his likely responses when the Supreme Court rules later in the week on Mr. Obama's health care law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If Obamacare is not deemed constitutional, then the first three and a half years of this president's term will have been wasted on something that has not helped the American people,'' Mr. Romney said. ''If it is deemed to stand, then I'll tell you one thing: We're going to have a president, and I'm that one, that's going to get rid of Obamacare. We're going to stop it on Day 1.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has been one of Mr. Romney's most reliable applause lines, and his comments underscored that he plans to attack Mr. Obama on health care, regardless of the court's ruling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Brooks and Collins on the Supreme Court, Arizona and the Affordable Care Act. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Brooks: Gail, let's praise the Supreme Court! I find it an endlessly impressive institution. Here are people who disagree on large issues with large consequences, and as far as I can tell they preserve an attitude of friendship and generosity toward one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail Collins: David, I'm sorry. There's no way you're getting me to say anything positive about this court until I hear what they have to say about the health care law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: They are also impressively loyal to their institution. They have known the health care decision for weeks - and at least some of their clerks have - and there hasn't been a single leak. What other body could do that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: I can appreciate the desirability of nonleakage but it's never been on my list of top 10 institutional virtues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: It's not just the institution that's impressive. I've also had the chance to meet many of the justices and I've found them to be remarkably kind, humble and fun to be around. I was at the N.Y.U. commencement this year and watched Sonia Sotomayor walk into the stadium to deliver her address. The students bombarded her with love and admiration - she's a kid from the Bronx who made good - and she remained modest and charming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had the chance to talk with Justice Kennedy recently - no, not about that - and found him intellectually alive, curious and informative about new findings in physics and neuroscience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I once was at a conference and I made some comment about a question I thought would be interesting to explore. Justice Breyer happened to hear the comment and said, &quot;I don't know the answer to that question, but here's one way to think about it&quot; and he handed me a flow chart of how the problem might be broken down. It was awesomely impressive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, these are some of the most trustworthy people in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: David, these are all great qualities for guests at a party! Also possibly for co-workers. You're pretty modest and charming yourself. But when it comes to the court, I'm waiting to see whether a majority of the justices decide to make a wild overreach and impose their political preferences on the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you remember a couple of years ago when the health care law was teetering in the Senate and the Democrats lost Ted Kennedy's seat in Massachusetts? We were conversing then and I was in a hotel somewhere. Don't remember the location but I do remember that I was typing while curled on the floor in a fetal position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, I'm in a hotel. This one's in Houston, where I'm waiting for the health care decision and prepared to resume the fetal position. If this law is thrown out it will be a disaster socially, politically and economically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: I'm hopeful the court will make a sensible decision because normalIy I find their decisions sensible. O.K., I'll make an exception for Citizens United. I wasn't that alarmed about it when the decision was first handed down, but I've become increasingly alarmed now. It will make it impossible to do tax reform if every loophole can be protected with hundreds of million dollars of &quot;super PAC&quot; ad buys. Conservatives should hate Citizens United because it protects state-capitalism, the incestuous relationships between business and government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: And you may have noticed that they reaffirmed their terrible decision this week by the same 5-to-4 margin that marks all their worst moments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: Otherwise, though, the court decisions seem prudent. I thought that Arizona immigration decision was sensible and balanced. They made it clear that immigration is a federal issue. At the same time they didn't totally trample's each state's ability to do law enforcement. In government you have to leave discretion to the people on the ground even if you can imagine ways they might abuse it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: Did you see Justice Scalia's opinion? It could have been written by John Boehner. Actually, John Boehner would have been less partisan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: But if you look over the span of their rulings, they seem quite rational. This is not an excessively ideological court. The percentage of 5-to-4 decisions has not increased over the Rehnquist court. This is a particularly modest court. It has been overturning statutes at a lower rate than earlier courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, this is a more conservative court than the previous ones, but not a sharply more conservative court. Our colleague Adam Liptak reported on data in 2010 that suggested that the Burger and Rehnquist courts ruled on the &quot;conservative&quot; side of an issue (favoring prosecutors and that sort of thing) 55 percent of the time. In its first five years, the Roberts court favored the &quot;conservative&quot; side 58 percent of the time, though in the individual term of 2009-10, that number rose to 65 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a difference, but not a stark difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: Once again, David, if they uphold the health care law, I will be prepared to listen to any amount of analysis about how this court isn't nearly as partisan as it seems to this perhaps slightly paranoid observer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: I have no idea how they will rule on health care. The law seems to me more disastrous the more I hear about the problems of implementation. I'm creeped out by the notion that the government can order you to buy a private good from a private company even if that transaction makes no sense for you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: This is the argument that always seems to lead to a discussion of whether the government can make you buy broccoli. That makes sense only if we were, as a civilized society, required to take you into an extremely expensive public institution and give you costly infusions of broccoli if you didn't eat it yourself. As long as we decline to allow sick uninsured people to just lie down and die on the side of the road, everybody has to have insurance for the health care system to work sanely. It's a conservative position. Just ask the 2006 version of Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: I'd rather see Obamacare reversed by an election than by a court decision. I worry about the turmoil that would follow if the mandate was struck and the rest of the law was preserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: You should also worry about what happens to the economy. I know you're concerned about the cost of health care insurance for businesses and the impact on the deficit of Medicare. The only way we get control of that is through a national health care program. And if this one goes down there will never be another attempt at major health care reform in my lifetime or yours or your future grandchildren's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: All my liberal friends down here in Washington are working themselves up into a pre-froth of pre-emptive rage. But I'm copacetic. I'd rather trust the court than most other bodies around this place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: Sign me up for the pre-froth program. But if my worries turn out to be blessedly unfoundedand the law is upheld, we can have another conversation about the virtues of the current court, and you will find me a changed woman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&quot;What we've seen in all of our research is the creative has got to be upbeat,&quot; said Seth Winter, the head of advertising sales for NBC's Olympics coverage. &quot;It's got to be empowering. It's got to be positive.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the news that the Obama campaign has purchased $5.5 million in commercial time during the coverage of the London Olympics, an NBC executive had advice for both presidential candidates: Don't go negative during the three weeks' worth of thrills of victory and agonies of defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive, Seth Winter, the head of advertising sales for NBC's Olympics coverage, on Wednesday confirmed the ad purchase by the Obama campaign and said that during the Games it should be all about accentuating the positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we've seen in all of our research is the creative has got to be upbeat,&quot; Mr. Winter said. &quot;It's got to be empowering. It's got to be positive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was a lesson learned in the 2008 election, Mr. Winter said: &quot;In the prior election, one of the candidates took another tack and I don't think it served him well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That candidate, Mr. Winter said, was John McCain. &quot;His creative was a little bit on the negative side,&quot; Mr. Winter said. &quot;And I don't think it did well. Our research showed it didn't do well for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The specific ad that the McCain campaign ran during the Beijing Olympics was one known as &quot;Celebrity,&quot; which mocked his opponent, Barack Obama, as being more of a shallow celebrity performer than a capable leader. It was the only one of four McCain ads during the Olympics that qualified as an attack ad, but was particularly criticized for running during the Parade of Nations march in the opening ceremonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as often happens with negative ads, it was the most memorable - and arguably the one with the most impact. At the time, some analyses of the political commercials during the Olympics indicated that the &quot;Celebrity&quot; ad was effective, at least in breaking through with viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report at the time in the trade publication Adweek indicated that &quot;Celebrity&quot; had a higher effectiveness rating than any of Mr. Obama's Olympics commercials, all of which were of the gauzy, positive variety. However, the McCain ad also turned off a lot of viewers. While 22 percent said they would be more likely to vote for Mr. McCain based on the ad, 27 percent said they would be less likely, Adweek reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Winter said NBC did not step in about the content of political ads unless they were based on false information. But he did say he would recommend that the campaigns recognize the Olympic television environment is almost uniformly upbeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The specifics of when and where the Obama ads will appear during the games - which begin July 27 - have yet to be settled, but they are expected to be placed across several platforms, including the NBC network, as well as its cable sister channels, MSNBC, CNBC, Bravo and NBC Sports Network. The purchase does not include digital ads on the sites that will carry some of the coverage live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is not likely to have the Olympic environment to himself. Mr. Winter said he expected to be making a deal soon with the Mitt Romney campaign. And despite healthy sales for the Games, Mr. Winter said each campaign would have opportunities to augment its commercial buys as the three weeks of coverage go along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We never sell out the Olympics,&quot; Mr. Winter said. &quot;If someone wants more time, we'll figure it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The attack is the latest iteration of President Obama's attempts to demonize Mitt Romney.&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's campaign is welcoming Mitt Romney to Virginia on Tuesday with an ad accusing Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, of sending American jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ad calls Mr. Romney the &quot;outsourcer in chief&quot; and asks whether Virginia voters want to send him to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney's companies were pioneers at shipping U.S. jobs overseas,&quot; the ad says, &quot;investing in firms that specialized in relocating jobs done by American workers to new facilities in low-wage countries like China and India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack is the latest iteration of Mr. Obama's efforts to demonize Mr. Romney's time at Bain Capital, the private-equity firm he led. But unlike the first attacks, which focused on workers who were fired by Bain-owned companies, the new ad targets jobs that were moved overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the president mocked Mr. Romney's campaign for trying to draw a distinction between outsourcing jobs and &quot;off-shoring&quot; jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're a worker whose job went overseas, you really don't need somebody explaining you the difference between outsourcing and offshoring,&quot; Mr. Obama said at a campaign event in Boston. &quot;What you need is somebody who is going to wake up every day fighting to make sure that investments and jobs are happening here in Massachusetts, and here in the United States of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, called the accusations in the new ads &quot;false and discredited attacks&quot; that are intended to &quot;divert attention from his abysmal economic record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If President Obama had even half of Mitt Romney's record on jobs, he'd be running on it,&quot; Ms. Saul said. &quot;But President Obama has the worst record on jobs and the economy of any president in modern history, which is why he is running a campaign based on distractions, not solutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mr. Romney's comments Tuesday underscored the fact that his campaign plans to use health care as an issue regardless of the Supreme Court's ruling. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SALEM, Va. - Mitt Romney's campaign is eagerly awaiting the Supreme Court's decision on President Obama's health care law, which is expected on Thursday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Tuesday, at a machinery company here, Mr. Romney offered a preview of the possible responses he has been readying for when the ruling finally comes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Obamacare is not deemed constitutional, then the first three-and-a-half years of this president's term will have been wasted on something that has not helped the American people,&quot; Mr. Romney said. &quot;If it is deemed to stand, then I'll tell you one thing: We're going to have to have a president, and I'm that one, that's going to get rid of Obamacare. We're going to stop it on Day 1.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Mr. Romney's most reliable applause lines has been his promise to repeal what he calls &quot;Obamacare,&quot; and his comments Tuesday underscored the fact that the Romney team plans to use health care as a campaign issue regardless of the court's ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney also  remarked on the court's decision Monday, to uphold a key provision of Arizona's controversial 2010 immigration law. Though Mr. Romney and his campaign had studiously avoided the specifics of the ruling on Monday - his traveling press secretary, Rick Gorka, went so far as to hold a seven-minute news conference that did not answer a single question - he began his remarks Tuesday by calling the situation &quot;a muddle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After criticizing Mr. Obama for failing to push through sweeping immigration reform, Mr. Romney said, &quot;The Supreme Court had to step in because states had to step in, states looking to find a way to solve the problems he didn't address, tried to address it in their own ways, and now the Supreme Court's looked at it, and what we're left with is a bit of a muddle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continued: &quot;But what we know is, the president failed to lead. He failed to do what he said he'd do. And so instead of focusing on immigration, and of course on the big issue, which was the economy and getting the economy going, he instead focused on putting in place his health care reform called Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, as a presidential race heads into the general election battle, the campaigns find themselves engaged in a call and response over the issue of the moment. One side attacks, the other responds, and vice versa. But Tuesday was a departure from that rhythm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign sought to keep the focus on the news of the day - the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on health care, which is a topic Mr. Obama's team would prefer to avoid. And the Obama campaign, in contrast, returned to Mr. Romney's record as a titan of private equity, releasing a new television ad and line of attacks that portray Mr. Romney as an &quot;outsourcer-in-chief.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new line of attack - on a subject that the Romney campaign would also prefer to avoid - seeks to demonize Mr. Romney's time at Bain Capital, and pulls from a Washington Post  last week that alleges that Mr. Romney's private equity firm invested in a series of firms that relocated jobs overseas to places like India and China.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mitt Romney's past Swiss bank account seems to be gaining favor as Democrats' metaphor for depicting the Republican candidate as out of touch with average Americans. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Tuesday joined President Obama in decrying Mitt Romney's investment record at Bain Capital, but Mr. Romney's past Swiss bank account seems to be gaining favor as Democrats' metaphor for depicting the Republican candidate as out of touch with average Americans.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A prospective president with a Swiss bank account and a retirement investments in the Cayman Islands?&quot; Mr. Biden said with mock incredulity in Waterloo, Iowa. &quot;Did you ever think you'd be choosing between two people running for president, one of whom had a Swiss bank account? He's out of touch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Biden, speaking to about 400 people at a United Auto Workers union hall, was beginning a two-day trip through the battleground state that the Obama campaign billed as a &quot;Strengthening the Middle Class Tour.&quot; Later he stopped in three other eastern Iowa towns, for treats and glad-handing at a deli in Independence, a drugstore ice cream counter in Manchester and a grocery store in Dubuque. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like Mr. Obama, who was campaigning Tuesday in Atlanta and Miami at fund-raisers, Mr. Biden seized on a recent Washington Post story to slam Mr. Romney for Bain's reported role as a &quot;pioneer&quot; in investing in and managing companies that sent jobs overseas.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You got to give Romney credit:  He's a job creator -- in Singapore, and China, and India,&quot; Mr. Biden said in Waterloo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amplifying the theme, the Obama campaign released separate 30-second ads in Iowa and two other swing states. The Iowa ad ended, &quot;Does Iowa really want an outsourcer-in-chief in the White House?&quot;    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Romney spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, issued a statement objecting that &quot;Vice President Biden today doubled down on the Obama campaign's same misleading attacks in an effort to distract voters from the president's disastrous economic record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the back-and-forth about Bain has gotten much of the attention, Mr. Biden is hardly the first Obama surrogate to use Mr. Romney's Swiss bank account against him. A financial manager for Mr. Romney has said the account was closed in 2010, between Mr. Romney's two runs for president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, for example, raises the issue at almost every stop as he campaigns for Mr. Obama around his state. &quot;Why would a man who wants to be president of the United States of America and has known he had that goal for years and years and years, why would he take his wealth and put it in a Swiss bank account?&quot; Mr. Strickland said recently in New Philadelphia, in eastern Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean that says something about his judgment as well as his values. What if all Americans did that? What if you and I took our meager resources out of the local bank here and decided to send them to Switzerland, what would that do to our economy?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, notification from the Russian government comes into the U.S. Nuclear Risk Reduction Center located at the State Department. Word arrives of any change for each of Moscow's nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles, each land- and sub-based launcher, or each strategic bomber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington sends similar information on U.S. nuclear forces to Russia's Nuclear Risk Reduction Center. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)  began on Feb. 5, 2011, &quot;we have exchanged over 2,500 [such] notifications,&quot; Rose Gottemoeller, acting undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Databases exchanged every six months detailing where each strategic nuclear weapon system is located, whether deployed, undergoing maintenance or being retired, provides &quot;a truly real-time look at what is going on inside the Russian strategic forces,&quot; Gottemoeller reported as part of an update on the treaty's implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, one of 13 Republicans who in December 2010 voted to ratify the treaty, requested the session. At the time of the vote, Mitt Romney, now the Republican presidential challenger, opposed the treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corker is up for reelection, and Tennessee's Republican primary is Aug. 2. His main opponent is a tea party member. More about that later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One critical part of the new treaty is its inspections, which take place when there are fewer sites to see and inspectors have a wider area of viewing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gottemoeller said there have been &quot;up to 25 short-notice inspections since the treaty entered into force.&quot; They included, she said, &quot;inspections that are designed to confirm the exact number of reentry vehicles, or warheads, on individual missiles selected for inspection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Gottemoeller said, &quot;We are now able to confirm the exact number of warheads on any randomly selected Russian ICBM and SLBM [sub-launched ballistic missile], something that we were not able to do under the 1991 START treaty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspectors also got their first good look at the new Russian RS-24 mobile ICBM and its launch vehicle, something not possible under the old treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madelyn Creedon, assistant secretary of defense for global strategic affairs, explained how the United States planned to get down to the new START limits of 1,550 deployed warheads on 700 delivery systems, as well as another 100 delivery platforms not deployed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also described plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to modernize the nation's triad of delivery systems, a critical part of the debate over the treaty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas D'Agostino, administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which runs the nation's nuclear weapons building complex, had the toughest time with the panel. The administration had fallen behind in getting Congress to approve increases in funding to rebuild the aging nuclear weapons complex - one basis for Corker and other Republicans  supporting the treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama requested the promised amount for the current fiscal year, but Congress, led by Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee, cut it. That means the administration's request for fiscal 2013 lags behind the 2010 promised amounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While requesting more money, the administration cut out advanced funding for what is to become a $6 billion major chemistry and metallurgy replacement (CMR) facility to deal with plutonium research at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Nonetheless, D'Agostino said that life extension programs are underway for 80 percent of the deployed nuclear systems and that a new $167 million radiological laboratory at Los Alamos could handle some plutonium research previously thought safe to do only in the postponed CMR building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corker told D'Agostino that he was &quot;highly disappointed in the follow-through on modernization [of the nuclear weapons complex]. . . . You know that you're still not living up to the commitments that have been made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corker focused particularly on plutonium pits, the nuclear triggers that ignite thermonuclear weapons, and the need to produce 50 or more a year in the future. Although the nation has several thousand pits taken from older warheads that have been retired, the major facility that built them at Rocky Flats, Colo., has been closed. A much smaller facility at Los Alamos provides about 20 pits a year, the number currently needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics have tied the delay of the CMR facility to the pits issue, but the facility has nothing to do with their production. D'Agostino explained to Corker that a new way to reuse pits is being planned but could be discussed only in closed session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An annoyed Corker noted that before the treaty &quot;the reuse of plutonium pits was not acceptable. Now, all of a sudden, it's acceptable. I just find that to be fascinating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corker closed his questioning by saying, &quot;For what it's worth, this one United States senator would be most reticent to agree to any treaty with this administration on any topic until something changes as it relates to the commitments on the START treaty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zach Poskevich, Corker's tea party electoral challenger, has criticized the senator's vote for the treaty, saying it &quot;extremely reduces the United States' capability to defend ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I expect some of Corker's statements Thursday to show up in a political ad on Tennessee TV sometime before Aug. 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treaty may not have helped make Corker's Senate seat more secure, but it certainly has made the nation safer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, notification from the Russian government comes into the U.S. Nuclear Risk Reduction Center located at the State Department. Word arrives of any change for each of Moscow's nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles, each land- and sub-based launcher, or each strategic bomber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington sends similar information on U.S. nuclear forces to Russia's Nuclear Risk Reduction Center. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)  began on Feb. 5, 2011, &quot;we have exchanged over 2,500 [such] notifications,&quot; Rose Gottemoeller, acting undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Databases exchanged every six months detailing where each strategic nuclear weapon system is located, whether deployed, undergoing maintenance or being retired, provides &quot;a truly real-time look at what is going on inside the Russian strategic forces,&quot; Gottemoeller reported as part of an update on the treaty's implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, one of 13 Republicans who in December 2010 voted to ratify the treaty, requested the session. At the time of the vote, Mitt Romney, now the Republican presidential challenger, opposed the treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corker is up for reelection, and Tennessee's Republican primary is Aug. 2. His main opponent is a tea party member. More about that later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One critical part of the new treaty is its inspections, which take place when there are fewer sites to see and inspectors have a wider area of viewing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gottemoeller said there have been &quot;up to 25 short-notice inspections since the treaty entered into force.&quot; They included, she said, &quot;inspections that are designed to confirm the exact number of reentry vehicles, or warheads, on individual missiles selected for inspection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Gottemoeller said, &quot;We are now able to confirm the exact number of warheads on any randomly selected Russian ICBM and SLBM [sub-launched ballistic missile], something that we were not able to do under the 1991 START treaty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspectors also got their first good look at the new Russian RS-24 mobile ICBM and its launch vehicle, something not possible under the old treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madelyn Creedon, assistant secretary of defense for global strategic affairs, explained how the United States planned to get down to the new START limits of 1,550 deployed warheads on 700 delivery systems, as well as another 100 delivery platforms not deployed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also described plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to modernize the nation's triad of delivery systems, a critical part of the debate over the treaty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas D'Agostino, administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which runs the nation's nuclear weapons building complex, had the toughest time with the panel. The administration had fallen behind in getting Congress to approve increases in funding to rebuild the aging nuclear weapons complex - one basis for Corker and other Republicans  supporting the treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama requested the promised amount for the current fiscal year, but Congress, led by Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee, cut it. That means the administration's request for fiscal 2013 lags behind the 2010 promised amounts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corker focused particularly on plutonium pits, the nuclear triggers that ignite thermonuclear weapons, and the need to produce 50 or more a year in the future.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;What ever happened to the Rose Garden strategy? <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In running for re-election, Barack Obama commands the most powerful democratic platform in world history and the greatest backdrop, the White House. A seemingly casual announcement in a TV interview can trigger a political earthquake, as Obama did when he endorsed gay marriage. But the president's magnificent residence can also be what Harry Truman called the Great White Jail.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidents are handcuffed by their power. Presidential statements can crash financial markets or start wars. The dignity of the presidency also inhibits, even in today's brutal political environment. Obama's campaign ad attacking Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital made some Democrats squirm as Republicans labeled the president &quot;another gut-punching politician from Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambivalence about presidents politicking goes back to the nation's founding. George Washington liked &quot;going on tour,&quot; getting &quot;huzzahed&quot; north and south - but, reflecting his contemporaries' distaste for democracy, he avoided explicit political talk. When the less popular President Martin Van Buren toured before his 1840 re-election campaign, his fellow Democrats feted him. Nevertheless, the new partisanship polarizing American politics had Whig Party critics denouncing Van Buren's activities as &quot;undignified&quot; and &quot;insulting,&quot; while mocking &quot;His Majesty, King Martin the First.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1864, Abraham Lincoln said he was too busy to campaign for reelection - a common presidential posture. Still, &quot;Honest Abe&quot; was a crafty pol, who was &quot;too busy looking after the election to think of anything else,&quot; according to his treasury secretary, William Pitt Fessenden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This posture of&nbsp;presidential passivity&nbsp;persisted, even after William Jennings Bryan's 18,000 mile 1896 stumping tour ended the charade for challengers, who now campaigned openly and vigorously. The hyperkinetic President Theodore Roosevelt chafed under the restrictions in 1904, comparing it to &quot;lying still under shell fire&quot; when he was a Rough Rider. Still, T.R. understood that no matter what he did his election would be a &quot;referendum on Roosevelt,&quot; as one aide said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impression of energetic politicking Theodore Roosevelt conveyed - even while he felt constrained - propelled presidents more explicitly into politics.&nbsp;In the 1930s and 1940s, Franklin D. Roosevelt perfected the presidential techniques of campaigning by governing and scoring political points by pretending to be nonpolitical. Roosevelt showered voters with governmental goodies while parrying reporters' political questions by saying &quot;I don't know nothin' about politics.&quot; Critics wondered how to criticize him as he saved starving children. Opponents &quot;could only talk,&quot; the&nbsp;Times&nbsp;columnist Arthur Krock marveled, as Roosevelt announced new initiatives in his campaign addresses.&nbsp;&quot;The president acted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, F.D.R.'s act reinforced the traditional impression that politicking besmirched the president. Even while presiding over his party as adeptly as he presided over the nation, even while understanding how to sell policies not just develop them, Roosevelt disrespected the democratic dialogue. He treated the sacred act of soliciting voters' support as a profane act of crass self-promotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1964, Lyndon Johnson, despite being a Roosevelt prot&eacute;g&eacute;, could not keep up the charade of acting presidential for long. &quot;Get in your cars and come to the speakin',&quot; he yelled as he motorcaded - and showered farm aid, disaster relief, food stamps and pay raises on the communities he visited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight years later, Richard Nixon took Roosevelt's public prudishness and private ruthlessness to such extremes that he ruined his presidency. In 1972, President Nixon said that he would win re-election simply by &quot;doing my job.&quot;&nbsp;White House staffers froze out reporters who dared treat Nixon as a candidate, even as he privately called the campaign &quot;a fight to the death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Watergate revelations made all politicians look crooked. Nixon's defense that every president acted ruthlessly resonated with the post-1960's adversary culture epitomized by the hypercritical news media. Conflict-oriented stories emphasized politicians' moral failings and the brutality of American politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Watergate debacle prompted a new presidential primness. Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter each followed a&nbsp;&quot;Rose Garden strategy&quot;&nbsp;while running for re-election, obscuring their political calculations in moralistic claims that the nation needed them working in the White House. This return to a nineteenth-century delicacy culminated in Michael Dukakis's 1988 campaign. Dismissed by one reporter as &quot;just a brain in the jar,&quot; the&nbsp;bloodless Massachusetts technocrat who was not even yet president was so busy declaiming what was and wasn't&nbsp;&quot;worthy of a presidential campaign,&quot;&nbsp;he blew a 20-point summertime lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As both candidate and president, Bill Clinton combated the growing perception that the Democrats had become the party of high-minded, long-winded, weak-chinned wimps who could not take a political punch. Clinton combined a Rooseveltian charm and duplicity with a shameless Nixonian ruthlessness that reassured Democrats after so many Reagan-era losses.&nbsp;&quot;I find it appalling that a lot of well-established people don't understand how important political skills are to governing,&quot; James Carville, Clinton's chief strategist, complained. If you don't win, &quot;you are never going to get anything done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before he became President, Barack Obama struggled with these mixed messages. In 2008, some aides welcomed stories that this high-minded philosopher-politician could be the&nbsp;tough Chicago pol&nbsp;when necessary.&nbsp;Now, Obama's supporters are using the recent backlash against his Bain ads to emphasize that Obama &quot;didn't survive and triumph in battles with Chicago politicians, some of whom resembled dockside thugs, because he's made of cotton candy,&quot; as the Democratic consultant Donna Brazile&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's image is a hologram, sometimes hovering above the fray, sometimes plunging into the political muck.&nbsp;With his Dream Act-like executive order halting the&nbsp;deportation&nbsp;of illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children, Obama is campaigning by governing as F.D.R. did, approaching the shamelessness of L.B.J. and the desperation of Clinton, banking on Americans' appetite for presidential remorselessness. No president can govern effectively without being a consummate politician, which includes knowing how to sell yourself, push your agenda, trim, spin, compromise, build coalitions, punish enemies and trash opposing ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While presidents also need to act proportionately and be statesmen-like, the presidential primness that began with George Washington was antidemocratic, reflecting the founders' fears of mob rule. In our more democratic era, we still should fear demagogues while cherishing popular politics.&nbsp;The challenge is particularly difficult these days when politics seems so poisonous and presidents shrewdly seek insulation from the toxicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treating politics as disreputable demeans democracy. The expanded involvement of voters in politics and the increased pressure on presidents to communicate with voters are among America's greatest democratic achievements of the last two centuries.&nbsp;Political skills in the White House are like guns in Dodge City. You want your guys to have them but worry when the bad guys wield them.&nbsp;Perhaps it's time to resurrect the 1964 complaint of the historian James MacGregor Burns, as the White House yet again becomes a &quot;round-the-clock, round-the-year campaign headquarters.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri has been a bellwether state for more than 100 years, with presidential candidates lavishing attention on Show Me State   voters and spending millions on field operations, glossy campaign mailers,  and TV ads. But this election? Not so much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, Missouri isn't on the list of top swing states -- those vote-rich battlegrounds that political experts and campaign strategists say will determine who wins the White House on Nov. 6. Most political handicappers instead have Missouri in the &quot;leans Republican&quot; column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So even though Barack Obama lost Missouri by fewer than 4,000 votes in 2008, the president's re-election campaign isn't expected to make a major investment in Missouri this time around. And Mitt Romney probably won't be tromping through the state  either. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other states  have bumped Missouri aside as an electoral battleground, because of demographic changes and political shifts within their borders. Virginia, for example, has seen a spike in affluent and politically moderate residents, particularly in the suburbs  outside Washington. And Colorado and Nevada have seen increases in their Hispanic populations, giving those Western states a purple hue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent TV ad spending, tracked by Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group, illustrates just how far off the political screen Missouri has fallen. From April 10 to May 29, ad spending clocked in at $8.4 million in Ohio; $4.3 million in Virginia; and almost $4.1 million in Pennsylvania. Down the list were Nevada, North Carolina, Iowa, and Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Missouri is not on the presidential TV radar screen right now,&quot; says Elizabeth Wilner, who conducted the analysis and is vice president at CMAG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri hasn't undergone any major demographic changes, but has seen a few subtle political shifts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly it's slightly more right-of-center today than it has been over the past 20 years,&quot; says Richard Martin, who ran Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill's  2006 Senate race. &quot;More and more Missourians who are concerned about their own balance sheet are also concerned with the country's balance sheet, and that just tends to shift voters&quot; rightward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still,  several statewide Democratic candidates, including incumbent Gov. Jay Nixon,  are expected to win in November, and Missouri's U.S. Senate contest is in the &quot;tossup&quot; column on most political pundits' lists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some political experts even say that Obama and Romney's advisers are making a mistake in bypassing Missouri, arguing the outcome on election night could be a nail-biter. Polls taken so far, on average, give Romney only a 3-percentage-point edge, according to RealClearPolitics,  a website that tracks  polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Missouri is probably more competitive than a lot of the pundits think,&quot; says Peverill Squire, a political science professor at the University of Missouri. &quot;The electorate that shows up in 2012 won't be very different from the electorate that showed up in 2008.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that election, Obama and Republican nominee John McCain competed fiercely for Missouri, and the Arizona senator eked out a win with only 49.4% of the vote, to Obama's 49.2%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in 2010, Republican Vicky Hartzler ousted Rep. Ike Skelton -- a 17-term incumbent Democrat -- and Republican Roy Blunt trounced his Democratic opponent, Robin Carnahan, in the U.S. Senate contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not that Missouri is a tremendously Republican state,&quot; says Jeff Roe, a Missouri-based GOP political consultant who worked for Rick Perry's presidential campaign. But &quot;Obama can't afford to spend any time in a state that he didn't win last time, so that alone takes Missouri off the map,&quot; he said. <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has built an overwhelming lead among Latino voters, a nationwide USA TODAY/Gallup Poll of Hispanics finds, as Republican challenger Mitt Romney faces a difficult path ahead to make inroads among what has been the nation's fastest-growing ethnic group for a generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president leads Romney 66%-25% among more than 1,000 Latino registered voters surveyed April 16 to May 31, matching his muscular showing in the 2008 election among Hispanics. Romney is in the weakest position among Latinos of any presidential contender since 1996 -- and in those intervening 16 years their percentage of the electorate has doubled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the poll was taken, Obama has fortified Hispanic enthusiasm by announcing he would block the deportation of an estimated 800,000 undocumented young Latinos who were brought to the United States as children. In a subsequent USA TODAY/Gallup survey, taken Wednesday-Saturday, more than eight in 10 Latinos approved of the president's action, most of them strongly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've seen that affect a lot of families, so that's actually something I'm pretty much in favor of,&quot; says Jonny Rozyla, 22, a college student from Anoka, Minn., a poll respondent who was interviewed by phone.  His mother was born in the United States and his father emigrated from Mexico. Rozyla says he &quot;strongly disagrees&quot; with Romney's statements about a controversial Arizona immigration law. &quot;I don't think he's for the people, mostly,&quot; he says of Romney. &quot;He's more for the rich than the poor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's troubles with Hispanic voters are likely to be spotlighted this week if the Supreme Court, as expected, rules on the constitutionality of the Arizona law, which requires police to check a person's immigration status when there is reasonable doubt about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Republican primaries, Romney endorsed the right of Arizona and other states to pass laws on immigration. And in recent days, he has sidestepped questions about whether he would overturn Obama's action blocking some deportations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a positive sign for the GOP over the long term, the poll finds a generational shift among Latinos that could open the door for Republicans as this immigrant group, like the ones that went before it, deepens its roots in the United States. But for the next four months of this election year, Romney's path is steeply uphill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has the most conservative position on immigration reform of any nominee of our lifetime,&quot; Obama campaign manager Jim Messina says. &quot;It's not the only issue Latino voters care about, but it is an important issue that shows people whose side they are on, and it's clear that Mitt Romney's against them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney campaign pollster Neil Newhouse says the economy is the top issue for Latinos, as for other voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's last-minute pandering to Hispanics can't make up for his record of failed policies that have resulted in Hispanics comprising fully one-third of Americans who are living in poverty,&quot; Newhouse says. &quot;Once Hispanic voters realize the president's broken promises to their community, Gov. Romney will win more than his share of their votes. This is why our campaign has been ramping up efforts to get our message to Americans of Hispanic descent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Romney announced Hispanic &quot;Juntos con Romney&quot; (&quot;Together with Romney&quot;) teams in 15 states, and his campaign has begun airing more TV and radio ads on Spanish-language stations.  In a  speech to a convention of Hispanic officials in Orlando on Thursday, he took a softer tone on immigration than he had  when  battling for the Republican nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He received a friendly reception from NALEO, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. But Obama, who spoke Friday, got a jubilant one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's comments during the GOP primaries are creating serious obstacles for him now. He promised to veto a proposal  that would provide a path to citizenship for young Latinos brought here illegally as children, and he said he wouldn't have voted to confirm the woman who became the first Hispanic  Supreme Court justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Running an ad that says, 'I would never vote for Sonia Sotomayor,' 'I would veto the DREAM Act' -- those are really easy things to crystallize and repeat,&quot; says Sylvia Manzano, a political scientist at Texas A&amp;M University who studies Hispanic politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A generational shift?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USA TODAY Poll's findings offer encouragement  for Republicans down the road. Among second-generation Latinos -- that is, those whose parents were born in the United States -- attitudes about the role of government shift significantly and openness to conservative policies expand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't mean Republicans are guaranteed to gain  Hispanic support over time, but it does mean there will be more opportunities for them to do so. That raises questions about the argument by some analysts that the nation's changing demographics all but ensure Democratic majorities in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider: On a list of a half-dozen issues, Latino registered voters who immigrated to the U.S. themselves rate immigration policies, a particular sore point with the GOP, as their highest priority. Latinos whose parents were born here rank immigration last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parker Maldonado, 43, a financial adviser from Goddard, Kan., who was called in the poll, is more concerned about pocketbook issues and argues that other Hispanics should be, too. His grandmother came  from Puerto Rico and his grandfather emigrated from Spain. &quot;Immigration is not going to mean anything if our economy doesn't improve,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the issues most important to him, Joel Gomez, 31, who emigrated from Mexico 10 years ago, praises Obama's recent step for young Hispanics. &quot;That's a relief for Latinos,&quot; says the Maryland construction worker, who was surveyed in Spanish. &quot;We can walk without fear through the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomez, who became a U.S. citizen three years ago, is inclined to cast his first presidential vote for Obama. Maldonado says he is likely to vote for  Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the USA TODAY survey, Latino registered voters who immigrated  say by almost 5-to-1 that the government should do more to solve our country's problems (a generally liberal view) rather than saying the government is trying to do too many things that should be left to individuals and businesses (a generally conservative view).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among registered Hispanic voters who are the U.S.-born children of immigrants,  that ratio  narrows to nearly 2-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And among those whose parents were born in the U.S., the split is about even.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings are based on a nationwide poll of 1,753 Hispanic adults, including 1,005 registered voters, taken in English and Spanish from April 16 to May 31. The margin of error is +/- 3 percentage points for the full sample and +/- 4 for  registered voters only. The poll was supplemented by a survey Wednesday through Saturday  of 424 Hispanics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama scores a wide lead among all three Hispanic groups, supported by 72% of Latino registered voters who immigrated themselves and by 69% of those with  at least one immigrant parent. Among those whose parents were born in the USA,  58% support the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Romney does twice as well among second-generation Latinos compared with immigrants. Among immigrant voters, just 18% support Romney. That number rises to 22% among the children of at least one immigrant parent and to 35% among Hispanics whose families have been in the U.S. for two generations or more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic pollster Margie Omero says she heard threads of &quot;generational movement and shift&quot; in a focus group of Hispanic women in Las Vegas this month that she helped run with Republican pollster Alex Bratty. The session was part of a series sponsored by Wal-Mart on middle-income women seen as swing voters and dubbed &quot;Wal-Mart Moms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They talked about what their parents went through and how different that was from what they were going through, and their children,&quot; she says. &quot;That's what we've seen with immigrant communities over our history. Each generation faces a different type of struggle, a different kind of interaction with the American community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama pollster Joel Benenson cautions, though, that what he calls a &quot;damaged&quot; relationship between the GOP and many Hispanic voters at a time Latino political power is rising will make those negative attitudes hard to reshape, even decades from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's the defining dynamic politically at the point at which you become engaged in voting and politics?&quot; he asks. &quot;We've gone through people who came in through the anti-war movement or the women's movement or the civil rights movement in the late '60s, early '70s. You had Reagan Democrats  who were in the early formative years of their politics when they voted for Reagan in the '80s. Those things that are really vibrant at the time you come into the political system can shape your thinking for a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A growing advantage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the long-term prospects for the GOP, in this election year Obama is solidifying the big gains he scored among Hispanics in 2008. Surveys of voters as they left polling places then found that 67% of Latinos voted for him, up by double digits from Democrat John Kerry's share four years earlier and  about the same level of support he has now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That advantage is increasingly powerful. An analysis of U.S. Census data by Mark Lopez of the non-partisan Pew Hispanic Center shows that the proportion of Latino eligible voters grew from 2008 to 2010 in seven of the 12  battleground states likely to determine November's outcome -- potentially a critical margin in a close election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Republican share of the Latino vote continues to erode, from 44% for George W. Bush in 2004 to 31% for John McCain in 2008 to 25% in the survey for Romney. &quot;We've seen a sharp drop-off  between 2004 and 2008,&quot; acknowledges Ed Gillespie, a senior Romney adviser and former Republican Party national chairman. &quot;It was a factor, obviously, in the margin of President Obama's win. We do need to do better with Hispanic voters, and I think we can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP strategist Leslie Sanchez estimates Romney needs the votes of  35% of Latinos to be competitive in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior Obama campaign official who was willing to speak about strategy only on condition of anonymity puts the bar higher in some key states. He calculates Romney needs to get a bit more than 40% of the Hispanic vote to win the battlegrounds of Florida and Nevada, where Latinos make up a significant share of the electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harsh rhetoric and hard-line policies toward illegal immigrants have soured many Latinos toward the GOP, even those who aren't particularly concerned about immigration for themselves and their families. &quot;It's the lens by which Hispanic voters view the Republican Party,&quot; says Sanchez, author of Los Republicanos: Why Hispanics and Republicans Need Each Other. &quot;It's the tinted lens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the roundtable discussion in Las Vegas, nine Latinas talked about their lives, their families and the election. The focus group was streamed live to  a small group of reporters in Washington, D.C.  They saw their votes as mattering: &quot;We're a community, and we want our voice to be heard,&quot; Karla Luarte, the mother of three, said as heads nodded around the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six of the women had voted for Obama in 2008, but several expressed disappointment in him now. Some have seen family members struggle to find a job; others have had trouble holding on to their houses. They note he has failed to enact the comprehensive immigration legislation he promised during the 2008 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They didn't know much about Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, though his business experience impressed some.  The aspirational message of the American dream, which is what many Republicans say they offer, struck a chord as they talked about their hopes for their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, asked which candidate they trusted more on immigration, eight hands went up for Obama and one for Romney.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARK CITY, Utah --They schmoozed with Mitt Romney at a barbecue cookout at the Olympic Park, pressing him on labor regulations and the threat of a nuclear Iran as downhill skiers performed midair flips behind them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They rubbed elbows with Beth Myers, who is running Mr. Romney's vice-presidential search, in the packed lobby bar of the Chateaux at Silver Lake, over $15 glasses of Scotch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they mingled with Mr. Romney's wife, Ann, during an intimate ''Women for Romney victory tea,'' held on an umbrella-shaded patio in this resort town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign, whose fund-raising prowess has defied assumptions about President Obama's financial advantages, offered wealthy donors and bundlers an extraordinary level of access to the candidate, his staff members, advisers and family this weekend at a three-day retreat that even seasoned political contributors said dwarfed previous presidential powwows. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's political operation seemed to all but shut down and relocate to the mountains of Utah. At least 15 senior campaign figures flew in for what blue-blazered guests from Texas, North Carolina and New York dubbed Republicanpalooza, delivering briefings on the effectiveness of Mr. Romney's and Mr. Obama's&nbsp;commercials and spinning them through the latest polling data, which they said showed the race as a dead heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Everybody was completely accessible,'' said Anthony Scaramucci, a New York financier and Romney fund-raiser who said the candidate took the time to warmly greet and thank him by his nickname, Mooch, at a dinner on the first night of the retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet for all the political and financial firepower assembled here, the Romney confab was not the only, or necessarily the most exclusive, gathering of ultrarich Republicans this weekend. In a simultaneous demonstration of the party's fund-raising might, the industrialist billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch held a conference for conservative megadonors at a resort outside San Diego. Over the past few years, their high-dollar strategy sessions have been the marquee events of the Republican campaign finance set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Koch conference touched off an unexpected -- and for the Romney campaign, somewhat unwelcome -- competition for top-flight moneyed supporters. While Mr. Romney's campaign officials have made it clear that they appreciate the efforts of wealthy backers like the Kochs, there was consternation among some on his finance team that the brothers decided to move forward with their conference after Mr. Romney scheduled his for the same weekend. As one fund-raiser noted, Mr. Romney is, after all, the candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign offered donors who gave $50,000 or raised $100,000 intimate seminars and discussions featuring leading Republican lights, past and present: Karl Rove, Condoleezza Rice, James Baker III, John McCain and Jeb Bush, whose presence represented a symbolic embrace of a candidate who struggled to win over the disparate elements of his party in the bruising primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Everyone is coming here to rally around the Romney flagpole,'' said Cheryl Halpern, a filmmaker who attended with her husband, Fred, a real estate developer from New Jersey. The pair went to a special Sabbath dinner at the retreat featuring kosher fare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, the scene here at a compound of high-altitude ski lodges seemed like an imitation Republican National Convention. In the span of a few moments, William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, greeted Michael Chertoff, George. W. Bush's secretary of homeland security, at an outdoor cafe as Mary Matalin, the conservative commentator, whizzed by in an extended-cab golf cart and Mr. Romney's brother, Scott, approached in a pair of shiny black pants from Prada. (Guests noted that Scott Romney's current and ex-wives were in attendance.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brenda LaGrange Johnson, a former United States ambassador to Jamaica who previously attended donor retreats held by President George W. Bush in Texas, said there was no comparison with Mr. Romney's event here. ''This is much more thorough,'' she said. ''This is much more extensive.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donors were unabashed about their desire to have face time with those who might constitute the brain trust in a Romney White House. David A. Wish, a Florida doctor and Romney fund-raiser, said that in order to sell the candidate to potential contributors, ''we need one-on-one time with the people who make decisions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after, Mr. Wish cornered Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser, for a brief chat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, of course, is not alone in granting his donors special treatment. Mr. Obama has invited major contributors to state dinners, put them on his Job Council and, as visitor logs show, allowed them into the White House for meetings with advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign took pains to personalize the experience. Arriving guests received beige Vineyard Vines canvas bags embroidered with the campaign slogan ''Believe in America.'' Inside was a Romney-branded navy blue baseball cap and pins that designated donation levels. The campaign's fund-raising chief, Spencer Zwick, signed 450 welcoming letters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donors attended policy discussions and round tables (like ''Innovation in America'' co-hosted by Ken Langone, a founder of Home Depot) that were tailored to their interests, both political and financial. Representative Connie Mack of Florida spoke at a session on energy policy. Ms. Matalin talked about the media, humorously recalling her conversation with Vice President Dick Cheney after he accidentally shot a friend on a hunting trip. And Ms. Rice addressed the need for renewed American leadership around the world, in a speech several guests called ''electrifying.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, the discussions took on a partisan tone, as when Mr. McCain scolded the Obama administration for security leaks and its foreign policy toward Russia, attendees said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mr. President, how many times are you going to hit that reset button on Russia?'' Mr. Scaramucci, the New York fund-raiser, quoted Mr. McCain as saying in a speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At another seminar, Mr. Romney's pollster, Neil Newhouse, disputed a recent Bloomberg News poll that said Mr. Obama had pulled well ahead of Mr. Romney, telling donors to look at different surveys instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney mixed with guests at an elaborate dinner at the foot of steep ski jumps and a winding bobsled course used in the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. Over barbecued beef, chicken and salmon, guests whispered advice on swing states and asked him about his chances against Mr. Obama, whose name was employed in an acronym by several attendees -- ''A.B.O.,'' anybody but Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Baker, the secretary of state under the first President George Bush, said the retreat reminded him of a conference that Gerald Ford held in Vail, Colo., as he laid the groundwork for his campaign against Jimmy Carter in 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That's what I see going on here,'' Mr. Baker said in an interview. ''We are going to have a different result. This year we are going to win.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday night, Mr. Rove held court on a hotel balcony with about a half-dozen financial executives, who peppered him with questions about Mr. Romney's chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You have to focus on Northern Virginia,'' a donor advised Mr. Rove, who is not working on the Romney campaign but has helped raise tens of millions of dollars and map out strategy for a pair of political groups attacking Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rove playfully mocked a Wall Street banker for his casual wardrobe: a baseball cap, gray hooded sweatshirt and a pair of worn bluejeans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You're the most underdressed banker I've ever met,'' Mr. Rove told him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. Rove walked away, the gaggle of men excitedly recounted the conversation, reveling in their access.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That's the price of admission right there,'' one donor said to another. ''Your six minutes with Rove.''</SPAN></P>

Now he has created a precipice of his own: The Fed on June 20 extended its Operation Twist program to swap $267 billion in short-term securities with longer-term debt through December. That end date coincides with reductions in federal spending, a halt to payroll-tax cuts and expiration of income-tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush. &para; The timing of Bernanke's easing raises the stakes for the Fed's four remaining policy meetings this year as investors focus on whether the central bank will provide stimulus for 2013, said Vincent Reinhart, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. &para; Policymakers this week cut their expectations for growth in 2012 to a range of 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent, down from an April prediction of 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent. The forecasts have been lowered in five of the six economic projections since January 2011.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not too surprising that Americans for Prosperity, a group founded with support from the billionaire Koch brothers, has cut a TV ad against U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, the power conservative group has ties to Kaine's opponent, Republican George Allen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles and David Koch, their political action committees and their employees have given more than $120,000 to Allen over his career, including $25,000 in this campaign, according to campaign finance records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are other connections, as well: They co-hosted a fundraiser for him and, when Allen was a senator, the Koch brothers PAC paid for Allen and a staffer to fly to Palm Springs to address an event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans for Prosperity advocates lower taxes and smaller government and has long involved itself in tax issues in Virginia and across the nation. The organization, which has its national headquarters in Arlington County and a state chapter in Richmond, played a significant role in the Republican takeover of the U.S. House in 2010 and has aired anti-Obama TV ads costing $7 million during this election cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Virginia taxpayers are calling Tim Kaine out: your tax and spending policies were bad for Virginia, and they are bad for America,&quot; said Audrey Jackson, the group's state director. &quot;It's time Kaine learned that you can't spend your way to prosperity or tax your way to economic freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group is embarking on a tour across the state Tuesday to tell Virginians that Kaine hurt families by &quot;saddling the state with debt and proposing higher taxes.&quot; The ad will air statewide for two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not surprising that special interest groups run by Washington lobbyists are rushing to bail out George Allen's reelection effort with false attacks,'' said Kaine spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine. &quot;In Washington, George Allen reliably did the bidding of a few wealthy special interests, while Virginia families and businesses paid the price. As he runs for reelection, Allen pledges to solve our fiscal challenges by asking seniors, students, businesses, and families to pay more out of their own pockets so that he can keep his promise to Washington lobbyists like Grover Norquist and his allies in the oil industry, like the Koch brothers, who are funding this ad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ad, titled &quot;First 100 Days: Virginia,&quot; the Republican presidential hopeful and former Massachusetts governor promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act and reverse President Obama's ban on offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">&quot;Running for governor, Mitt Romney campaigned as a job creator. But as a corporate raider, he shipped jobs to China and Mexico. As governor, he did the same thing: outsourcing state jobs to India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">- voiceover of new Barack Obama campaign </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign apparently loves to ding former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney with the charge of &quot;outsourcing.&quot; On _blankseveral             _blank occasions, we have faulted the campaign for its claims, apparently to little avail.            Now, all of the claims have been combined in one 30-second ad, with the added incendiary charge that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was a &quot;corporate raider.&quot; Let's look anew at this material.          The Facts           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phrase &quot;corporate raider&quot; has a particular meaning in the world of finance. Here's the _blankdefinition on Investopedia:              &quot;An investor who buys a large number of shares in a corporation whose assets appear to be undervalued. The large share purchase would give the corporate raider significant voting rights, which could then be used to push changes in the company's leadership  and management. This would increase share value and thus generate a massive return for the raider.&quot;In other words, this is generally an adversarial stance, in which an investor sees an undervalued asset and forces management to spin off assets, take the company private or break it up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a previous life, The Fact Checker covered renowned corporate raiders such as Carl Icahn and his ilk. We also have closely studied Bain Capital and can find no examples that come close to this situation: Its deals were done in close association with management. Indeed, Bain generally held onto its investments for four or five years, in contrast to the quick bust-em-ups of real corporate raiders. So calling Romney a &quot;corporate raider&quot; is a real stretch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how does the Obama campaign justify this phrase? It cites _blanka single Reuters story from last August about a campaign stop in New Hampshire, written by a stringer. Buried in the article is a reference to Romney as a &quot;former corporate raider.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          &quot;Reuters typically refers to Romney as a 'former private equity executive' or something along those lines,&quot; said Ros Krasny, the news service's Boston bureau chief. &quot;Of the hundreds of times we have referenced Romney over the past year or more, honestly, that example from [the stringer] must have just slipped through the net - 10 months ago.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A better source for Romney's behavior as an investor might be someone who actually worked on Wall Street, such as former Obama auto czar Steven Rattner. &quot;Bain Capital is not now, nor has it ever been, some kind of Gordon Gekko-like, fire-breathing corporate raider that slashed and burned companies, immolating jobs wherever they appear in its path,&quot; Rattner _blankwrote in Politico this year.Regarding the outsourcing claims, we have frowned on these before. The Obama campaign rests its case on three examples of Bain-controlled companies sending jobs overseas. But only one of the examples - involving Holson Burns Group - took place when Romney was actively managing Bain Capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the other claims, concerning Canadian electronics maker SMTC Manufacturing and customer service firm Modus Media, the Obama campaign tries to take advantage of a gray area in which Romney had stepped down from Bain - to manage the Salt Lake City Olympics - but had not sold his shares in the firm. We had _blankpreviously given the Obama campaign three Pinocchios for such tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          The Modus Media case is also not an example of shipping jobs overseas. The company closed one plant in California and transferred the jobs to North Carolina, Washington and Utah. At the same time, it opened an unrelated plant in Mexico. The Obama campaign once _blanktrumpeted the fact that we had dinged a conservative super PAC for making the same leap in logic.          The claim that Romney outsourced jobs as governor is equally overblown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This concerns Romney's veto of a bill that would have prohibited Massachusetts from contracting with companies that outsourced the state's work to other countries. Lawmakers were especially concerned about a $160,000-a-month contract with Citigroup to operate a system of electronic food-stamp cards that included a customer phone service center in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the liberal editorial page of the Boston Globe and conservative editorial page of the Boston Herald urged Romney to veto the amendment, saying it would cost the state money. Romney agreed, _blanksaying the measure did not protect state jobs - the call center might have moved from India to another state - but &quot;had the potential of costing our citizens a lot more money.&quot; The Democratic-dominated Massachusetts legislature did not override his veto, even though it overturned 117 others, suggesting that there was little real support for the measure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the food-stamp contract expired, the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance insisted that those jobs be returned to the United States. But they ended up in a call center based in Utah - just as Romney had predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we mentioned, we recounted this ancient Massachusetts history before. So we were very surprised the Obama campaign cited that critical Fact Checker column as a source for the ad in its backup materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also cites as a source _blanka Boston Globe article from last month that merely reports on _blankan earlier ad making similar charges. That's highly circular reasoning - and is not fair play.Tom Hamburger of The Washington Post reported Friday that some Bain companies earned money in part by helping other companies subcontract work overseas. That is an interesting area for inquiry but not the same as saying he was &quot;a corporate raider&quot; who &quot;shipped jobs to China and Mexico.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney can't run from his record. At Bain and in Massachusetts, he had the chance to keep jobs in America and sent them overseas instead,&quot; said Kara Carscaden, deputy press secretary for the Obama campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">           The Pinocchio Test          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign fails to make its case. On just about every level, this ad is misleading, unfair and untrue, from the use of &quot;corporate raider&quot; to its examples of alleged outsourcing. Simply repeating the same debunked claims won't make them any more correct. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Four Pinocchios</SPAN></P>

Bush. &Acirc;&para; The timing of Bernanke's easing raises the stakes for the Fed's four remaining policy meetings this year as investors focus on whether the central bank will provide stimulus for 2013, said Vincent Reinhart, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. &Acirc;&para; Policymakers this week cut their expectations for growth in 2012 to a range of 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent, down from an April prediction of 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent. The forecasts have been lowered in five of the six economic projections since January 2011.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Business</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not too surprising that Americans for Prosperity, a group founded with support from the billionaire Koch brothers, has cut a TV ad against U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, the power conservative group has ties to Kaine's opponent, Republican George Allen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles and David Koch, their political action committees and their employees have given more than $120,000 to Allen over his career, including $25,000 in this campaign, according to campaign finance records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are other connections, as well: They co-hosted a fundraiser for him and, when Allen was a senator, the Koch brothers PAC paid for Allen and a staffer to fly to Palm Springs to address an event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans for Prosperity advocates lower taxes and smaller government and has long involved itself in tax issues in Virginia and across the nation. The organization, which has its national headquarters in Arlington County and a state chapter in Richmond, played a significant role in the Republican takeover of the U.S. House in 2010 and has aired anti-Obama TV ads costing $7 million during this election cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Virginia taxpayers are calling Tim Kaine out: your tax and spending policies were bad for Virginia, and they are bad for America,&quot; said Audrey Jackson, the group's state director. &quot;It's time Kaine learned that you can't spend your way to prosperity or tax your way to economic freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group is embarking on a tour across the state Tuesday to tell Virginians that Kaine hurt families by &quot;saddling the state with debt and proposing higher taxes.&quot; The ad will air statewide for two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not surprising that special interest groups run by Washington lobbyists are rushing to bail out George Allen's reelection effort with false attacks,'' said Kaine spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine. &quot;In Washington, George Allen reliably did the bidding of a few wealthy special interests, while Virginia families and businesses paid the price. As he runs for reelection, Allen pledges to solve our fiscal challenges by asking seniors, students, businesses, and families to pay more out of their own pockets so that he can keep his promise to Washington lobbyists like Grover Norquist and his allies in the oil industry, like the Koch brothers, who are funding this ad.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ad, titled &quot;First 100 Days: Virginia,&quot; the Republican presidential hopeful and former Massachusetts governor promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act and reverse President Obama's ban on offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Day One, President Romney moves to repeal Obamacare and attacks the deficit, starting with $20 billion in savings,&quot; the voice-over says. &quot;By Day 100, President Romney reverses Obama's offshore drilling ban, creating thousands of new jobs for Virginians. . . .

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Running for governor, Mitt Romney campaigned as a job creator. But as a corporate raider, he shipped jobs to China and Mexico. As governor, he did the same thing: outsourcing state jobs to India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - voiceover of new Barack Obama campaign ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign apparently loves to ding former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney with the charge of &quot;outsourcing.&quot; On _blankseveral_blank occasions, we have faulted the campaign for its claims, apparently to little avail.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, all of the claims have been combined in one 30-second ad, with the added incendiary charge that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was a &quot;corporate raider.&quot; Let's look anew at this material.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The Facts</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phrase &quot;corporate raider&quot; has a particular meaning in the world of finance. Here's the _blankdefinition on Investopedia: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An investor who buys a large number of shares in a corporation whose assets appear to be undervalued. The large share purchase would give the corporate raider significant voting rights, which could then be used to push changes in the company's leadership  and management. This would increase share value and thus generate a massive return for the raider.&quot;In other words, this is generally an adversarial stance, in which an investor sees an undervalued asset and forces management to spin off assets, take the company private or break it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a previous life, The Fact Checker covered renowned corporate raiders such as Carl Icahn and his ilk. We also have closely studied Bain Capital and can find no examples that come close to this situation: Its deals were done in close association with management. Indeed, Bain generally held onto its investments for four or five years, in contrast to the quick bust-em-ups of real corporate raiders. So calling Romney a &quot;corporate raider&quot; is a real stretch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how does the Obama campaign justify this phrase? It cites _blanka single Reuters story from last August about a campaign stop in New Hampshire, written by a stringer. Buried in the article is a reference to Romney as a &quot;former corporate raider.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reuters typically refers to Romney as a 'former private equity executive' or something along those lines,&quot; said Ros Krasny, the news service's Boston bureau chief. &quot;Of the hundreds of times we have referenced Romney over the past year or more, honestly, that example from [the stringer] must have just slipped through the net - 10 months ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A better source for Romney's behavior as an investor might be someone who actually worked on Wall Street, such as former Obama auto czar Steven Rattner. &quot;Bain Capital is not now, nor has it ever been, some kind of Gordon Gekko-like, fire-breathing corporate raider that slashed and burned companies, immolating jobs wherever they appear in its path,&quot; Rattner _blankwrote in Politico this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the outsourcing claims, we have frowned on these before. The Obama campaign rests its case on three examples of Bain-controlled companies sending jobs overseas. But only one of the examples - involving Holson Burns Group - took place when Romney was actively managing Bain Capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the other claims, concerning Canadian electronics maker SMTC Manufacturing and customer service firm Modus Media, the Obama campaign tries to take advantage of a gray area in which Romney had stepped down from Bain - to manage the Salt Lake City Olympics - but had not sold his shares in the firm. We had _blankpreviously given the Obama campaign three Pinocchios for such tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Modus Media case is also not an example of shipping jobs overseas. The company closed one plant in California and transferred the jobs to North Carolina, Washington and Utah. At the same time, it opened an unrelated plant in Mexico. The Obama campaign once _blanktrumpeted the fact that we had dinged a conservative super PAC for making the same leap in logic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim that Romney outsourced jobs as governor is equally overblown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This concerns Romney's veto of a bill that would have prohibited Massachusetts from contracting with companies that outsourced the state's work to other countries. Lawmakers were especially concerned about a $160,000-a-month contract with Citigroup to operate a system of electronic food-stamp cards that included a customer phone service center in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the liberal editorial page of the Boston Globe and conservative editorial page of the Boston Herald urged Romney to veto the amendment, saying it would cost the state money. Romney agreed, _blanksayingthe measure did not protect state jobs - the call center might have moved from India to another state - but &quot;had the potential of costing our citizens a lot more money.&quot; The Democratic-dominated Massachusetts legislature did not override his veto, even though it overturned 117 others, suggesting that there was little real support for the measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the food-stamp contract expired, the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance insisted that those jobs be returned to the United States. But they ended up in a call center based in Utah - just as Romney had predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we mentioned, we recounted this ancient Massachusetts history before. So we were very surprised the Obama campaign cited that critical Fact Checker column as a source for the ad in its backup materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also cites as a source _blanka Boston Globe article from last month that merely reports on _blankan earlier ad making similar charges. That's highly circular reasoning - and is not fair play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Hamburger of The Washington Post reported Friday that some Bain companies earned money in part by helping other companies subcontract work overseas. That is an interesting area for inquiry but not the same as saying he was &quot;a corporate raider&quot; who &quot;shipped jobs to China and Mexico.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney can't run from his record. At Bain and in Massachusetts, he had the chance to keep jobs in America and sent them overseas instead,&quot; said Kara Carscaden, deputy press secretary for the Obama campaign. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> The Pinocchio Test</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign fails to make its case. On just about every level, this ad is misleading, unfair and untrue, from the use of &quot;corporate raider&quot; to its examples of alleged outsourcing. Simply repeating the same debunked claims won't make them any more correct. Four Pinocchios</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today: Mitt Romney and immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you know, American Hispanics are an important and fast-growing voting bloc. Romney has long had a strategy for winning them over. The key, he explained last year, is to tell them ''what they know in their heart, which is they or their ancestors did not come here for a handout.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hard to get more appealing than that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was Primary Mitt, who had a long history of whacking his Republican opponents with soft-on-illegal-immigrants charges. In the 2008 campaign, he accused Rudy Giuliani of making New York a ''sanctuary city'' and Mike Huckabee of supporting ''in-state benefits for illegal immigrants.'' One of his ads called John McCain a champion of ''amnesty for illegals.'' The Romney news release that accompanied the ad's debut mentioned ''amnesty'' 17 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It didn't work. McCain won the nomination anyway. That was the earlier version of John McCain, before he lost the presidential race and was abducted by space aliens who took him off to a distant planet and substituted a cranky android with an obsession about border fences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Romney tried the same tactics on Rick Perry. ''I got to be honest with you. I don't see how it is that a state like Texas -- you go to the University of Texas, if you're an illegal alien, you get an in-state tuition discount,'' he complained during one of the debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perry suggested that when it came to undocumented students who had been brought to the country as children, Romney had no heart. Also, he tried to get some mileage out of the fact that Mitt had once employed illegal immigrants to tend his yard. But it was, you know, Rick Perry, so, of course, nothing worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Romney is the inevitable Republican nominee, and this week there he was, speaking to a large group of prominent Hispanics. It was his first chance to try out his strategy, but astonishingly, Romney did not tell the audience what they knew in their hearts about in-state tuition and other handouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the word ''handout'' never came up. Romney did tell the inspiring story of his father's emigration from Mexico at the age of 5, although not the part about how the family had gone down there in the first place to avoid American laws against polygamy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there was quite a bit about the economy. You certainly can't blame Romney for mentioning it every chance he gets. But not everybody would choose to follow ''liberty's torch can burn just as brightly for future generations of immigrants'' with a call to lower the corporate tax rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plus, standard Mittspeak. We are going to have a lot of this in the coming months, people. Let's pause for a minute while you test your ability to be a Mitt Romney speechwriter:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O.K., the Ds. And not the most stirring speech in the history of the world. Obama, who followed up on Friday, got a warmer reception. But let's try to figure out what Romney actually said. Except when it came to certain lawn-mowing episodes, he's always talked very tough on illegal immigration. Now that he's sniffing around for Hispanic voters, is he going to change his tune?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer: Romney vowed to address the problem ''in a civil and resolute manner.'' That was a surprise. I really thought he'd go for ''impolite yet wishy-washy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many of our big policy debates, immigration reform has dwindled away to an argument about something less than sweeping. In this case, it's the Dream Act, the popular plan to let people who were brought here illegally as kids become citizens if they get a college degree or serve in the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Primary Mitt was going to veto it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Election Mitt will take the military service part, ''and if you get an advanced degree here, we want you to stay here.'' (Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses bearing Ph.D.'s and master's degrees in civil engineering or computer science. ...)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the mere college graduates, whom Obama has now announced he will protect from deportation under an executive order, Romney was, um, vague. But whatever he does will be ''long-term.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, he seems to have banished ''self-deportation'' and ''amnesty'' from his vocabulary. Unless it looks as if they'll come in handy somewhere down the line.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In what amounted to the general election campaign's first immigration debate, President Obama told a Latino audience that had heard from Mitt Romney that they should not trust Mr. Romney's shifting rhetoric. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. - President Obama assailed Republicans on Friday as obstacles to fixing the nation's immigration system and said his opponent would block efforts to let young immigrants stay if they were brought into the United States illegally by their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what amounted to the general election campaign's first debate on immigration policy, Mr. Obama appeared before the same Latino audience that heard from his challenger, Mitt Romney, a day earlier and told them they should not trust Mr. Romney's shifting rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama touted his own decision last week to stop kicking many young immigrants out of the country, saying he was &quot;lifting the shadow of deportation&quot; from those who deserved to stay in the United States. By contrast, he pointed to Mr. Romney's opposition to legislation known as the Dream Act intended to offer a path to legal status for many of the same young people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's long past time we gave them a sense of hope,&quot; Mr. Obama said of those spared by his action. &quot;Now, your speaker from yesterday has a different view. In his speech, he said when he makes a promise he'll keep it. Well, he's promised to veto the Dream Act and we should taken him at his word. I'm just saying. I believe that would be a tragic mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama noted that Republican opposition blocked passage of the Dream Act in 2010 and lamented that Republicans who supported more expansive legislation just a few years ago have now abandoned the issue. &quot;Those same Republicans have been driven away from the table by a small faction in their own party,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's camp focused on economic issues in their response on Friday. &quot;No election year speech can cover up the president's job-killing policies that have led to 11 percent Hispanic unemployment and millions of Hispanics living in poverty,&quot; Amanda Henneberg, a Romney spokeswoman, said in a statement. &quot;On Day 1, Mitt Romney will take our country in a new direction and get our economy back on the right track.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's speech to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials was framed to capitalize on last week's decision, bolstering support from a critical constituency that leans strongly in his direction but has been disappointed that he has not taken stronger action to liberalize immigration rules. Mr. Obama has deported more illegal immigrants than any other president, while in the face of Republican resistance he has done relatively little to push broader legislation providing a path to legal status for millions more in the country without permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress still needs to come up with a comprehensive immigration solution, rather than argue that we did this the wrong way or for the wrong reasons,&quot; he said. &quot;To those who say Congress should be the one to fix this, absolutely. To those who say we should do this in a bipartisan way, absolutely. My door's been open for 3 1/2 years. They know where to find me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama received a warmer response from the audience than Mr. Romney did on Thursday, with those in attendance at times standing to give him ovations. But a conservative Hispanic leader said the president's words rang hollow to him given the lack of progress in forging a bipartisan solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where is the leadership?&quot; asked Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles. He said that President George W. Bush did a better job of working across the aisle on immigration and argued that Mr. Romney would be more likely to find a solution with a Republican Congress next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a better chance of getting something constructive done in immigration with Romney than Obama,&quot; Mr. Aguilar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his remarks, Mr. Obama left for Tampa, where he planned to make a campaign speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three $1 million contributions in May sharply increased the fortunes of the Democratic ''super PAC'' backing President Obama even as his campaign stepped up spending amid concerns expressed by top advisers about being wildly outspent this fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priorities USA Action, which is run by two former White House aides, reported raising $4 million in May, more than a twofold increase over its collections a month earlier. Officials at the group said fund-raising in June had already exceeded May's haul. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven-figure contributions came from Barbara Stiefel, a longtime Democratic fund-raiser from Florida; Franklin L. Haney, a real estate developer from Tennessee, and Steve Mostyn, a trial lawyer in Texas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three helped Priorities draw almost even -- at least for the month -- with Restore Our Future, the primary super PAC backing Mitt Romney, which reported raising about $5 million in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spike in donations comes as top campaign officials for Mr. Obama traveled to Washington to give reporters an update on the race. The advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity so that they could frankly discuss their strategy, predicted that Mr. Romney and groups backing him would spend $1.25 billion on television advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Republicans are betting they can win this thing on the air,'' one senior adviser said. ''Make no mistake, we will be outspent.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That worry was underscored by the groups backing Mr. Romney's presidential bid, who on Wednesday reported large hauls in May. Restore Our Future reportedly received a $10 million pledge in June from Sheldon Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate who donated millions to Newt Gingrich's presidential bid during the primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also is facing millions of dollars in advertisements against him from American Crossroads, a super PAC, and its sister organization, Crossroads GPS, an advocacy group that does not disclose its donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign filed a complaint on Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission demanding that Crossroads GPS disclose its donors, citing a recent court case. In response, a spokesman for Crossroads noted that Priorities USA also has a sister organization that does not disclose its donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of disclosure has hampered fund-raising on the Democratic side in the past. For much of 2011, Priorities USA Action operated without the blessing of Mr. Obama, who had repeatedly lambasted the flow of undisclosed money into campaigns after the Citizens United Supreme Court Case in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign altered course in February, embracing the Democratic super PAC and sending some of its top advisers to help with fund-raising. Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for Mr. Obama's campaign, said Wednesday that the campaign helps raise money only for Priorities USA Action, the part of the group that discloses its donors, though he acknowledged that the group has a sister organization that does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We were 100 percent clear that we weren't supporting any'' group that does not disclose, Mr. LaBolt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two campaigns revealed their May fund-raising totals this month. Mr. Romney and the Republican National Committee raised about $78 million in contrast to $60 million from Mr. Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, the campaigns provided details about their fund-raising in filings with the Federal Election Commission. The D.N.C. totals included a virtual who's who from Hollywood, including: Kirk Douglas, Billy Crystal, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, Salma Hayek and Burt Bacharach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign increased spending, particularly in advertising but also in polling and focus groups. Mr. Obama's campaign detailed its spending on television commercials, including a $25 million ad campaign it had announced earlier. The reports show Mr. Obama spent $28.9 million on television ads in May and an additional $5.4 million on online ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney more than doubled his fund-raising total from April by collecting $23.4 million in May, and he ended the month with $17 million in cash on hand. A joint committee with the Republican National Committee brought in $7.1 million of Romney's total.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Far more money has gone into attacking the A.C.A. than defending it. Maybe it's not surprising that people neither understand it nor like it. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times's Abby Goodnough reported today that right-wing groups have spent $235 million on ads attacking President Obama's health-care law - and seem to have gotten their money's worth. People hate the law, they don't understand it, they think it's something that will hurt, oppress and bankrupt them - even when it won't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People like Erika Losse, a part-time worker in her mid-30s with no health insurance, who pays out of pocket for care and would probably qualify for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. She told Abby, &quot;I'm positive I can't afford it.&quot; Actually, what she can't afford is insurance  the ACA.<BR><BR>The article explains that spending on the other side has been minuscule - that there are very few ads sticking up for the law, and those that try to do so are lame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know with your health insurance, you may now have some preventive benefits with no co-pays or out-of-pocket costs?&quot; asks one ad from the Department of Health and Human Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using such tentative, even-keeled language is the equivalent of pulling out a knife in a gunfight. The pro-health care side talks of &quot;some preventive benefits&quot; while the antagonists call Obamacare a socialist-rationing-Canadian scheme to destroy freedoms, bankrupt society and hasten early death. Wasn't that why Natasha Richardson died in a skiing accident - because it happened in CANADA?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of the law, which has been the signature domestic achievement of Mr. Obama's presidency. But opponents of health care reform have always seen this as two battles - for the opinions of judges and for the opinions of voters. It looks like they may already have won the second.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting to keep his job, President Obama spent more money than he raised in May, and ended the month with a $109.7million in cash reserves -- a more than 6-to-1 advantage over his Republican rival Mitt Romney, federal reports filed Wednesday show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who has been able to  accumulate cash as Romney fended off primary challengers, spent three times more in May than he did in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That reflects new investments in staff -- a total of 703 campaign workers in May, up from 631 a month earlier -- and the barrage of television commercials in battleground states that have touted his  record and slammed presumptive GOP nominee  Romney's business career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly half of the contributions to Obama's main campaign account last month came from donors who gave $200 or less. He will need to tap those contributors again as he tries to match Romney's fundraising, which surged ahead of Obama's last month for the first time. A quarter of Romney's May donations came in small amounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney and the Republican Party reported collecting $76.8 million in May, nearly $17 million more than Obama and the Democratic National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bulk of that, however, went to party and joint fundraising committees. Romney's campaign raised $23.4million, records show, while Obama's raised $39.1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee, now an extension of Romney's campaign, ended May with $60.8million in the bank -- cash reserves it can deploy to build a get-out-the-vote effort for the former Massachusetts governor. That's twice the amount of cash reserves held by the DNC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign  has raised the specter of being outspent by Romney and his supporters, as wealthy Republicans continue to write  checks to  super PACs and non-profit advocacy groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restore Our Future, a super PAC helping Romney, took in nearly $5million in May, besting the $4 million that a pro-Obama group, Priorities USA Action, said it collected last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly $1 out of every $5 Restore Our Future collected in May came from three Dayton companies that share an address. <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fresh off the best fundraising stretch of his presidential campaign, Mitt Romney plans to spend this weekend strategizing and fraternizing with his biggest bundlers at a posh resort in Park City, Utah.          The presumptive Republican nominee and his senior advisers and aides are hosting two days of policy sessions and campaign strategy discussions at the Deer Valley resort for more than 100 top fundraisers and their spouses. Those who raised more than $100,000 are expected to attend.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a dozen Republican heavy-hitters are scheduled to join the private retreat as special guests. According to a fundraiser who is attending, they include some GOP stars thought to be in contention to be Romney's vice presidential running mate: Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.), Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Sen. John Thune (S.D.). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George W. Bush strategist Karl Rove, who helps run American Crossroads, the well-funded GOP super PAC, is planning to speak at the retreat, said the fundraiser, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the event and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Rove's appearance could raise questions because of laws barring any coordination between super PACs and campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), the party's 2008 presidential nominee, also is scheduled to attend, according to the fundraiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other expected guests include former secretaries of state Condoleezza Rice and James A. Baker III, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, strategist Mary Matalin, and commentators Bill Kristol and Fred Barnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting coincides with good news for Romney's campaign, which for the first time last month raised more money than President Obama. The campaign and the Republican National Committee jointly raised $77 million in May, outpacing the $61 million that Obama and the Democratic National Committee reported collecting.In a report to the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday, the Romney campaign said it spent $15.6 million in May. Obama campaign officials reported spending nearly three times that, $44 million, shelling out cash faster than they could raise it. That allowed Romney to begin catching up in the cash he has on hand - $107 million for his campaign and the RNC, compared with $147 million for Obama and the DNC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama officials predicted Wednesday that they will be badly outspent on television ads, suggesting that Republicans and allied groups would invest $1.2 billion in airtime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Restore Our Future, a super PAC founded by former Romney aides to boost his candidacy, told the FEC that it raised nearly $5 million in May and spent nearly all of it, mostly on ads. That report did not include $10 million donated by casino magnate Sheldon Adelson this month. The PAC launched a $7 million ad buy in eight battleground states this week.          Also planning to attend the Park City gathering are many of Romney's top aides and advisers, including former Utah governor Mike Leavitt, whom the candidate has tapped to begin planning his transition to the White House should he win in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's finance officials have touted the retreat as a way to reward top-performing bundlers, who make their own donations and then raise many times that from their networks of friends and associates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The retreat, which will be closed to the news media, is set to begin Friday with policy question-and-answer sessions with Romney. The donors will be briefed on campaign strategy and will spend considerable time planning ways to build on the initial general-election fundraising success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a May fundraiser, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, chairman of Romney's New York finance operation, called the retreat &quot;very, very important&quot; for the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event is to be a sort of homecoming for Romney, who lived in Park City for three years when he helmed the 2002 Winter Olympics. Two of his sons, Josh and Ben, live in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receptions and dinners with Romney and his guests are planned for Friday and Saturday night, with dessert and dancing on the agenda for Saturday evening. The festivities continue Sunday with golf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You get to go home and tell your friends and family and colleagues, 'I just spent the weekend with Mitt Romney,' and all of that is really good for morale,&quot; said a second fundraiser who will be there and who also was not authorized to speak publicly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1396 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the country, something is missing from the campaign ads of men and women running for Congress: the word &quot;Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, &quot;Senate,&quot; &quot;senator&quot; and &quot;representative&quot; are making only rare cameos in these campaign ads. The absence is especially pronounced in the case of incumbents who are  asking voters to reelect them  in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you go from working in a family seed business in Iowa to fighting for Iowans at the highest levels?&quot; a narrator intones in an ad for Rep. Tom Latham (R-Iowa).          The highest levels of what, exactly? The ad notes that Latham took &quot;Iowa common sense&quot; to Washington and voted against the stimulus package - but never exactly spells out that he has served at the highest levels of the U.S. government - in Congress - since 1995.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are years when incumbents can tout their experience and legislative achievements as they seek reelection. This is not one of those years, as the approval ratings of the gridlocked Congress have begun to approach the popularity of pond scum among an increasingly disenchanted electorate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is that consultants and strategists who run congressional campaigns appear to be employing some artful ad copy to avoid mentioning that their candidates are  members of Congress. &quot;They don't use their title. They don't refer to their years of service. They don't show pictures of themselves in committee meetings,&quot; said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan congressional analyst, explaining the incumbent-as-outsider strategy.  &quot;They have to acknowledge the anger, the frustration. They've got to run as agents of change,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Rick Berg (R-N.D.), who is running for the Senate, appeared in a campaign ad earlier this year with his mother, Francie.          &quot;I want to tell you about my son, Rick Berg,&quot; she said, seated at a kitchen table next to him. She said that he had grown up on a farm, working cattle, bailing hay and learning the value of a dollar. She vouched for his knowledge of &quot;the North Dakota way.&quot;           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She declined to mention that he also knows at least something about the Washington way, having served as North Dakota's only member of Congress since 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign officials generally deny that their candidates are ducking the congressional label, and it is hard to deny or obscure membership in that body. But after more than a year of bitter disputes on Capitol Hill - a handful of near government shutdowns, a showdown over raising the nation's legal borrowing limit last summer, the utter failure of a special deficit-reduction &quot;supercommittee&quot; - it's clear that this year, even the incumbents are running as outsiders who say they will shake the place up. Although this is not an entirely new strategy, more incumbents may be forced to embrace it, given the political climate.           Congressional approval ratings, once as low as 10 percent, have lifted to a comparatively rosy 17 percent. But they have not been above 20 percent all year, making Congress the least popular branch of government by far.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Congress has at best a 20 percent approval rating, it's pretty hard to run as an incumbent,&quot; said Mark McKinnon, a Republican strategist and admaker. &quot;The best and only thing candidates can do is to vigorously point out every reason why you are not like the rest of your colleagues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Massachusetts, Boston television correspondent Gail Huff does not mention that her husband, Scott Brown, has served in the Senate for 21 / 2 years in a pair of ads now running in Massachusetts praising Brown (R) as a supportive husband and attentive father.                    &quot;Scott did all the morning routine - get the girls up, get them fed, get them dressed, get them off to school,&quot; she says, as an image of Brown doing the laundry flashes on the screen.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incumbents know that they can run only so far from their congressional affiliations. In addition to his wife's testimonials, Brown is airing a separate ad that mentions Senate votes he has taken, but he has focused his campaign on separating himself from the partisan gridlock in Washington by talking about what he is doing to end it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when they talk about Washington, it is often to disdain the Congress in which they serve: &quot;If you're looking for Martin Heinrich on weekends, you won't find him here,&quot; opens an ad for the Democratic Senate candidate from New Mexico, as a picture of the U.S. Capitol flashes on the screen. &quot;You'll find Martin in New Mexico.&quot;          But why would viewers even think to look for Heinrich in Washington? The ad assumes that they already know that his weekday job has been as a congressman since 2009. The ad ends with the lawmaker declaring: &quot;Our problems won't be solved by the powers-that-be in Washington, but by the hard-working people of New Mexico.&quot;           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Playing down a congressional history is a particularly vexing problem for House members, such as Heinrich, who are hoping for a promotion to the Senate, and troublesome for tea party freshmen who helped Republicans win the House in 2010 and now find themselves forced to run as influential members of the body they once railed against. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Michigan, a new billboard from the National Republican Congressional Committee for Rep. Dan Benishek, a physician, shows the freshman in hospital whites and encourages voters to &quot;trust a doctor to fix Washington,&quot; according to the Detroit Free Press. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             &quot;Meet Bobby,&quot; reads one tab on the campaign Web site for Rep. Bobby Schilling (R-Ill.), who had never held elected office before he won his House seat in two years ago.          Underneath is a 300-word biography of Schilling that includes information about his high school and college years, his 10 children and the pizza parlor he owns in Moline, Ill. It does not mention that he is already a congressman.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An oversight, Schilling said in a recent interview, arguing that his constituents may think Washington is broken but are pleased with his work on their behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll have that addressed,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm proud to tell people I'm a member of Congress. It's humbling to tell people that I go to Washington to work for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ReelectBobby.com does mention elsewhere that Schilling serves in Congress. But a week later, his biography remained unchanged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Iowa's Latham also said admakers did not purposely leave out the congressman's job title in the campaign ad. Because of redistricting, Latham is facing fellow Rep. Leonard L. Boswell (D), which could neutralize incumbent kryptonite for either man.          &quot;I don't think we're under any illusion that people aren't aware or won't be aware that this is a race between two sitting members of Congress,&quot; said Latham campaign manager James Carstensen, noting that Latham's campaign has sent mailers bragging that a local newspaper named him Iowa's most effective congressman.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Carstensen said, the anger in the country is very real - less targeted toward incumbents specifically and more at Washington for not tackling the nation's biggest problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got to share your frustration as an American and an Iowan with the institution you're serving in,&quot; he explained. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In North Dakota, a spokesman for Berg said he has no qualms about discussing his service in Congress in his campaign against former state attorney general Heidi Heitkamp, as the two compete to replace Sen. Kent Conrad (D), who is retiring.North Dakotans are concerned primarily with Democrats in the Senate, said spokesman Chris Van Guilder, who they believe have not cut spending and have blocked reasonable bills passed by House Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People know he's a congressman - a hard-working one at that,&quot; Van Guilder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But campaign consultants might do well to examine one recent New Jersey race. Because of redistricting, the Democratic primary this month pitted two congressmen - both first elected in 1996 - against each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          One, Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., billed himself as a &quot;100 percent New Jersey fighter.&quot;          The other, Rep. Steven R. Rothman, advertised that he was &quot;our congressman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guess who won.              heldermanr@washpost.com          </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, &quot;Senate,&quot; &quot;senator&quot; and &quot;representative&quot; are making only rare cameos in these campaign ads. The absence is especially pronounced in the case of incumbents who are  asking voters to reelect them  in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you go from working in a family seed business in Iowa to fighting for Iowans at the highest levels?&quot; a narrator intones in an ad for Rep. Tom Latham (R-Iowa).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highest levels of what, exactly? The ad notes that Latham took &quot;Iowa common sense&quot; to Washington and voted against the stimulus package - but never exactly spells out that he has served at the highest levels of the U.S. government - in Congress - since 1995.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are years when incumbents can tout their experience and legislative achievements as they seek reelection. This is not one of those years, as the approval ratings of the gridlocked Congress have begun to approach the popularity of pond scum among an increasingly disenchanted electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is that consultants and strategists who run congressional campaigns appear to be employing some artful ad copy to avoid mentioning that their candidates are  members of Congress. &quot;They don't use their title. They don't refer to their years of service. They don't show pictures of themselves in committee meetings,&quot; said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan congressional analyst, explaining the incumbent-as-outsider strategy.  &quot;They have to acknowledge the anger, the frustration. They've got to run as agents of change,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Rick Berg (R-N.D.), who is running for the Senate, appeared in a campaign ad earlier this year with his mother, Francie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to tell you about my son, Rick Berg,&quot; she said, seated at a kitchen table next to him. She said that he had grown up on a farm, working cattle, bailing hay and learning the value of a dollar. She vouched for his knowledge of &quot;the North Dakota way.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She declined to mention that he also knows at least something about the Washington way, having served as North Dakota's only member of Congress since 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign officials generally deny that their candidates are ducking the congressional label, and it is hard to deny or obscure membership in that body. But after more than a year of bitter disputes on Capitol Hill - a handful of near government shutdowns, a showdownover raising the nation's legal borrowing limit last summer, the utter failure of a special deficit-reduction &quot;supercommittee&quot; - it's clear that this year, even the incumbents are running as outsiders who say they will shake the place up. Although this is not an entirely new strategy, more incumbents may be forced to embrace it, given the political climate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional approval ratings, once as low as 10 percent, have lifted to a comparatively rosy 17 percent. But they have not been above 20 percent all year, making Congress the least popular branch of government by far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Congress has at best a 20 percent approval rating, it's pretty hard to run as an incumbent,&quot; said Mark McKinnon, a Republican strategist and admaker. &quot;The best and only thing candidates can do is to vigorously point out every reason why you are not like the rest of your colleagues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Massachusetts, Boston television correspondent Gail Huff does not mention that her husband, Scott Brown, has served in the Senate for 21 / 2 years in a pair of ads now running in Massachusetts praising Brown (R) asa supportive husband and attentive father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scott did all the morning routine - get the girls up, get them fed, get them dressed, get them off to school,&quot; she says, as an image of Brown doing the laundry flashes on the screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incumbents know that they can run only so far from their congressional affiliations. In addition to his wife's testimonials, Brown is airing a separate ad that mentions Senate votes he has taken, but he has focused his campaign on separating himself from the partisan gridlock in Washington by talking about what he is doing to end it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when they talk about Washington, it is often to disdain the Congress in which they serve: &quot;If you're looking for Martin Heinrich on weekends, you won't find him here,&quot; opens an ad for the Democratic Senate candidate from New Mexico, as a picture of the U.S. Capitol flashes on the screen. &quot;You'll find Martin in New Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But why would viewers even think to look for Heinrich in Washington? The ad assumes that they already know that his weekday job has been as a congressman since 2009. The ad ends with the lawmaker declaring: &quot;Our problems won't be solved by the powers-that-be in Washington, but by the hard-working people of New Mexico.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Playing down a congressional history is a particularly vexing problem for House members, such as Heinrich, who are hoping for a promotion to the Senate, and troublesome for tea party freshmen who helped Republicans win the House in 2010 and now find themselves forced to run as influential members of the body they once railed against. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Michigan, a new billboard from the National Republican Congressional Committee for Rep. Dan Benishek, a physician, shows the freshman in hospital whites and encourages voters to &quot;trust a doctor to fix Washington,&quot; according to the Detroit Free Press. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meet Bobby,&quot; reads one tab on the campaign Web site for Rep. Bobby Schilling (R-Ill.), who had never held elected office before he won his House seat in two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underneath is a 300-word biography of Schilling that includes information about his high school and college years, his 10 children and the pizza parlor he owns in Moline, Ill. It does not mention that he is already a congressman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An oversight, Schilling said in a recent interview, arguing that his constituents may think Washington is broken but are pleased with his work on their behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll have that addressed,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm proud to tell people I'm a member of Congress. It's humbling to tell people that I go to Washington to work for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ReelectBobby.com does mention elsewhere that Schilling serves in Congress. But a week later, his biography remained unchanged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Iowa's Latham also said admakers did not purposely leave out the congressman's job title in the campaign ad. Because of redistricting, Latham is facing fellow Rep. Leonard L. Boswell (D), which could neutralize incumbent kryptonite for either man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think we're under any illusion that people aren't aware or won't be aware that this is a race between two sitting members of Congress,&quot; said Latham campaign manager James Carstensen, noting that Latham's campaign has sent mailers bragging that a local newspaper named him Iowa's most effective congressman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Carstensen said, the anger in the country is very real - less targeted toward incumbents specifically and more at Washington for not tackling the nation's biggest problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got to share your frustration as an American and an Iowan with the institution you're serving in,&quot; he explained. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In North Dakota, a spokesman for Berg said he has no qualms about discussing his service in Congress in his campaign against former state attorney general Heidi Heitkamp, as the two compete to replace Sen. Kent Conrad (D), who is retiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Dakotans are concerned primarily with Democrats in the Senate, said spokesman Chris Van Guilder, who they believe have not cut spending and have blocked reasonable bills passed by House Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People know he's a congressman - a hard-working one at that,&quot; Van Guilder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But campaign consultants might do well to examine one recent New Jersey race. Because of redistricting, the Democratic primary this month pitted two congressmen - both first elected in 1996 - against each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One, Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., billed himself as a &quot;100 percent New Jersey fighter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other, Rep. Steven R. Rothman, advertised that he was &quot;our congressman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guess who won.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dimon, Testifying Before House, Stays on Message &nbsp;|&nbsp; Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, tussled with lawmakers on Tuesday in his second showdown in Washington since JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, disclosed a multibillion-dollar trading loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, members peppered Mr. Dimon, once considered Washington's favorite banker, with pointed questions about the bank's aggressive lobbying, its failures in risk management and its focus on complex bets in the credit markets instead of lending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike their Senate counterparts, who accorded Mr. Dimon more deferential treatment last week, House lawmakers demanded answers. At one point, Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who helped write the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, told Mr. Dimon to &quot;stop filibustering&quot; and said that he was frankly &quot;disappointed&quot; with some of the banker's answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing was the latest chapter of the trading debacle, which has drawn new cries from lawmakers for tougher oversight of the nation's banks and spurred wide-ranging inquiries by regulators and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<BR>DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Thiel Opens a New Venture Capital Firm &nbsp;|&nbsp; Peter Thiel is putting his Facebook proceeds back to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The billionaire investor, best known for his contrarian views and his early bet on the social network, has opened a new venture capital firm, Mithril Capital Management, with a $402 million fund. While it's unclear how much Mr. Thiel, who sold some $640 million worth of shares in Facebook's I.P.O., contributed to the pot, he is the fund's largest investor, according to a statement issued on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The San Francisco-based firm will fit somewhere between Mr. Thiel's other investment firms, Founders Fund, which tends to focus on earlier stage investments and Clarium Capital, a global macroeconomic hedge fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mithril, led by Mr. Thiel and former Clarium managing director Ajay Royan, will seek &quot;growth&quot; opportunities - start-ups that have already raised some venture capital and are looking to ramp up significantly. According to Mr. Royan, the firm is looking globally but it is not interested in pre-I.P.O. companies, or companies on the verge of going public. He predicts Mithril's average investment will be north of $20 million. <BR>DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dimon, Testifying Before House, Stays on Message &nbsp;|&nbsp; Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, tussled with lawmakers on Tuesday in his second showdown in Washington since JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, disclosed a multibillion-dollar trading loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, members peppered Mr. Dimon, once considered Washington's favorite banker, with pointed questions about the bank's aggressive lobbying, its failures in risk management and its focus on complex bets in the credit markets instead of lending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike their Senate counterparts, who accorded Mr. Dimon more deferential treatment last week, House lawmakers demanded answers. At one point, Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who helped write the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, told Mr. Dimon to &quot;stop filibustering&quot; and said that he was frankly &quot;disappointed&quot; with some of the banker's answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing was the latest chapter of the trading debacle, which has drawn new cries from lawmakers for tougher oversight of the nation's banks and spurred wide-ranging inquiries by regulators and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<BR>DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Thiel Opens a New Venture Capital Firm &nbsp;|&nbsp; Peter Thiel is putting his Facebook proceeds back to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The billionaire investor, best known for his contrarian views and his early bet on the social network, has opened a new venture capital firm, Mithril Capital Management, with a $402 million fund. While it's unclear how much Mr. Thiel, who sold some $640 million worth of shares in Facebook's I.P.O., contributed to the pot, he is the fund's largest investor, according to a statement issued on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The San Francisco-based firm will fit somewhere between Mr. Thiel's other investment firms, Founders Fund, which tends to focus on earlier stage investments and Clarium Capital, a global macroeconomic hedge fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mithril, led by Mr. Thiel and former Clarium managing director Ajay Royan, will seek &quot;growth&quot; opportunities - start-ups that have already raised some venture capital and are looking to ramp up significantly. According to Mr. Royan, the firm is looking globally but it is not interested in pre-I.P.O. companies, or companies on the verge of going public. He predicts Mithril's average investment will be north of $20 million. <BR>DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama and several conservative groups are going head-to-head in a flurry of new attack ads, trading accusations over mishandled economic policies and inattention to the plight of struggling Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next week and a half, viewers in 10 battleground states will be hit with $33 million in advertising, part of an aggressive effort by Mr. Obama, Mitt Romney and three conservative advocacy groups to define their opponent before undecided voters make up their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign released two television commercials on Wednesday that condemn Mitt Romney as a &quot;corporate raider&quot; who shipped jobs overseas, cut taxes for the wealthy and raised fees on the middle class. Both ads end with the campaign's latest attack slogan, an attempt to turn Mr. Romney's financial experience as a private equity executive into a liability: &quot;Romney economics: it didn't work then, and it won't work now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new advertising from Mr. Romney and the conservative groups - a $20 million offensive - takes aim at the president on two issues: his economic leadership and his health care overhaul plan, which the Supreme Court is set to rule on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One ad that is running in six states as part of a $5 million effort by the Concerned Women for America features a female doctor who worries that the new health care law will force her to stop seeing some of her patients. &quot;I've looked at this law. &nbsp;I know the consequences: delayed care and worse yet, denied care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No fewer than three new ads turn Mr. Obama's recent verbal misfire&nbsp; - &quot;the private sector is doing fine&quot; - back on him. There are minor variations in style, but the ads all contain the same message: the president is out of touch. All three also have the same title, &quot;Doing Fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign, which has committed $3.4 million to television advertising through early next week, started its version of &quot;Doing Fine&quot; last week, a twist on a 2008 commercial from the Obama campaign that mocked Senator John McCain for uttering the ill-timed phrase &quot;the fundamentals of our economy are strong&quot; as the stock market was plummeting and the economy was collapsing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restore Our Future, the pro-Romney &quot;super PAC,&quot; started running its version this week as part of a $7.2 million buy, as did Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers-affiliated group, with a $4.6 million buy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 10 states included in the latest spate of advertising are&nbsp;Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. </SPAN></P>

But those of us who bothered to get off the bus and talk to voters back then -- voters who weren't part of a captive audience rounded up for McGovern -- knew that the little ditty was not just rhetorical. McGovern would get 38% of the Ohio vote that November to nearly 60% for Richard Nixon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those kinds of blowouts are rare -- Ronald Reagan repeated it in 1984 -- but normally elections here are much closer. Regardless of the size of the victory, no Republican has ever made it to the White House without winning Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So here we are again, with another tight race. I now live at Ground Zero, bombarded by ads for President Obama and Mitt Romney, both of whom were in Ohio speaking on the economy last week. Having lived in 11 states and every region of the country, and having covered or closely observed presidential elections since 1968, I should be some kind of political sage. But the contradictory attitudes of voters captured by pollsters here and across the nation are testing my sagacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On average, almost 60% of Americans think the country is on the &quot;wrong track.&quot; According to Gallup, 64% fear that big government is the &quot;biggest threat&quot; to the nation. Almost three-fourths of Americans say they favor a free market over a government-managed economy. A lopsided majority want Obama's health care reform plan struck down. Yet, Obama continues to hold his own against  Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independents decide</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I understand the math on party loyalty. What doesn't compute for me is how this could be a close election. But I have a scary theory: While some independents, who are growing in numbers and will decide this thing, understand instinctively what's at stake, not nearly enough do -- or care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I never imagined that a president, in only one term, could set up such a stark choice for voters. We can recommit ourselves to free enterprise as the creator of prosperity for all who are willing to work for it, or embrace an entitlement society represented in the incredible Obama  cartoon ad that promises cradle-to-grave government support for a girl named &quot;Julia.&quot; That ad, like the one attacking Romney's past affiliation with the &quot;vultures&quot; at Bain Capital, is simply a proxy for the real issue: Which way do we want the country to go?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not about taxing the super-rich more, or maintaining a safety net for the truly needy, or locking up a bunch of Wall Street crooks. I'm for all those things. And it's not about gay marriage or contraceptives or too much fat in our diets. It's about preserving American capitalism or gravitating to a form of European democratic-socialism. And about the kind of country we want to be, or reclaim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most interesting book I've read this year is Charles Murray's Coming Apart, which documents what happened to white Americans culturally and economically in the  period of 1960 to 2010. Murray's writings are often controversial, but some of his conclusions in this book are not what you'd expect from a libertarian conservative. Most notably, he contends that the roughly 20% of white Americans in the upper-middle and upper classes have used their education, work ethic, family focus and inbreeding to segregate themselves, to the detriment of the rest of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plight of lower class</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the 30% of whites in the lower class have become increasingly dysfunctional, with more single mothers, less education, and more unemployed or underemployed adults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know enough people in both groups to agree with Murray, although he gives too much credit to the presence or absence of the &quot;founding virtues&quot; and not enough credit to a changing American economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the relevance of all this to the presidential campaign  is?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owing to various economic forces, (outsourcing, illegal immigration, bankruptcies and technological efficiencies), the middle class is being pulled in two directions.  Unfortunately, the downward pull is stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama solution is to have the federal government heavily subsidize those caught in the downdraft, which is why the number of people on government assistance is at an all-time high. That's a political strategy you'd expect from a liberal Democrat who gets caught saying the private sector is in fine shape (and has to rebuke himself for his fleeting moment of candor) while bemoaning the loss of government jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney solution, on the other hand, is to create an environment where entrepreneurialism can thrive, with the risks that entails: less government regulation, targeted tax breaks (including on more than $1 trillion in U.S. profits parked in foreign banks) and incentives for investment that have a real punch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a clear choice. Capitalism isn't perfect, but it's better than any other economic system ever devised. Swing state Ohio needs more of it. And if Romney wants to win, he needs to keep coming back to Ohio, singing that tune.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking on Apple's iPad would seem to be a tough task, but Microsoft on Monday took up the challenge, introducing a new tablet computer called Surface. The new product marks a foray into making hardware for a company known mostly for its software, but it is an acknowledgement, writes Nick Wingfield, that the company needed to depart from its regular way of doing business to maintain its dominance in computing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like all forms of entertainment, public radio needs revitalization from time to time.  NPR, with many of its core shows showing their age, is on the lookout for fresh new programs that will appeal to younger, more diverse audiences, writes Elizabeth Jensen. The question is whether station programmers will make a bet on the new offerings or retreat to safe choices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Mitt Romney finishing up a six-state bus tour on Tuesday, Sarah Wheaton looks at the bus excursion as a relatively recent phenomenon in presidential campaigns. Noting that John McCain's &quot;Straight Talk Express'' helped popularize the naming of candidate tours, she looks at some other lively names, including Newt Gingrich's &quot;Jobs and Growth'' tour that some of his staff referred to as &quot;Newt Talk Express.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still going to big electronics stores for your televisions, DVDs and CDs? Still even using DVDs? It's a dwindling consumer group, Stephanie Clifford reports, which is why Best Buy has been battling financial woes, and other big box retailers like Walmart and Target are trying to find ways to lure customers back into their stores. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRIENDSHIP brings such blessings. And such bargains! Only because of our closeness was President Obama willing to drop his asking price and offer me a picture and a moment with him on the cheap. At least that's what my invitation to a fund-raiser last Thursday night said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't mean the Thursday night fund-raiser: that vaunted din-din at Sarah Jessica Parker's crib in Greenwich Village, where 50 glitterati paid 40 grand each. (I'll multiply: that's a $2 million haul.) I mean a second, follow-up fund-raiser, headlined by Mariah Carey at the Plaza, to which the president and first lady quickly zipped, double-dipping in Manhattan's lucrative waters to maximize their catch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Plaza event was for a ''small group of friends,'' said the invitation, which came to me by mistake. (Like most journalists, I don't give political donations.) The invitation also said that in light of those friendships, the ''contribution amount has been kept low.'' How low? I had to open up an attachment to find out: a mere $10,000 for one person, $15,000 for a couple. Pocket change! Since 250 ''friends'' reportedly ended up in this ''small group,'' that's another $2 million haul, give or take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, Obama opted out of public financing for the general election, which would have given him $84 million for the September-to-November phase of the race but prevented additional fund-raising. He raised many times that -- his total, stretching back to the start of his primary campaign, was about $750 million -- and hugely outspent John McCain, who took public financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years later the Supreme Court, in the disastrous Citizens United ruling, cleared the way for unlimited donations to -- and expenditures by -- ''super PACs'' that could promote a given candidate so long as they didn't coordinate with him or her. Republican bigwigs got to furious work, determined to put Obama at the financial disadvantage this time around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And here we are, in an age of austerity surreally contradicted by the hundreds of millions being poured into campaigns. By some estimates Election 2012 will be a $2 billion affair, the majority of that probably amassed and put into play on the Republican side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are indeed two Americas and two economies: one in which a conservative titan like Sheldon Adelson and his relatives blithely funnel $21 million toward the lost cause of Newt Gingrich, and another in which the median net worth of an American family has dropped to $77,300, which is roughly where it was in the early 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign spending skyrockets while government spending is under siege. Political ad makers get rich while infrastructure crumbles. And presidential candidates have been turned into platinum-level panhandlers. When they could and should be mulling the metastasizing challenges of a country on the ropes, they're begging: to crowds of more than 1,000 and klatches of just a few dozen; over breakfasts and lunches and dinners; in multiple states on single days. Obama traveled to Maryland and Pennsylvania on Tuesday and pulled off six fund-raisers in as many hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's office seekers present vague promises but a detailed pricing chart. For X amount you get a speech; for more, a photo; for even more, all of that plus banter over canapes. Politicians are like airlines. You can fly them economy, business or first class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or you can try to buy one of your own. Isn't that essentially what the Koch brothers and Adelson are doing? As Nicholas Confessore reported in The Times last week, Charles and David Koch lead a group of conservative donors who have pledged to raise some $400 million during this campaign cycle for issue groups, including their super PAC, while Adelson and his family have thus far given at least $35 million to super PACs that support Republicans. Of that, $10 million recently went to Restore Our Future, which backs Romney. Adelson has said that he might spend $100 million when all is said and done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That is a great deal of money,'' noted McCain, a longtime proponent of tighter regulations on money in politics, in an interview Thursday on ''PBS NewsHour.'' ''And, again, we need a level playing field.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT we have, instead, is a gaudy free-for-all, so loopy and unctuous as to defy belief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor, yukking it up on the phone with a blogger who successfully passed himself off as David Koch and said, ''I'll fly you out to Cali and really show you a good time.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Outstanding,'' Walker responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have Romney ignoring Donald Trump's attention-mongering tantrums about Obama's birthplace in return for fund-raising help, including a 63rd birthday lunch for Ann Romney on the 66th floor of Trump Tower in Manhattan. That was in April. The cynosure of the equestrienne-themed cake was an edible Ann on an edible horse. The tally was reportedly $600,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have both the Romney and Obama campaigns soliciting donations by promising to enter donors in lotteries for dinner with the candidate and one (or more) of his celebrity boosters, and we have e-mail subject lines from the Obama campaign like these: ''Clooney,'' ''George Clooney. Really'' and ''Throw Bo a bone.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo as in the First Dog. The money hunt enlists all creatures great and small.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have early, primary-season assessments of candidates that hinge largely on what sort of fund-raising chops they seem to have. It's a bizarre qualification for governing, but a transcendent one, and that's been true for a few nutty decades now. George W. Bush in 2000, Howard Dean in 2004, Rick Perry this time around: all generated excitement because all generated money. Before the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary comes the first fund-raising report. It's nearly as relevant a verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have difficulty taking anything at face value. Did Cory Booker, the Newark mayor, denounce the Obama campaign's attacks on Bain Capital because he was really all that nettled by the negativity, or was he pacifying Wall Street, whose largess, which he enjoys, can be essential to a New Jersey politician? It's impossible not to wonder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have a financial arms race, which leads to a barrage of negative attack ads, which turn an already incendiary partisanship positively sulfurous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, as the fund-raising frenzy came into more ghastly relief, there were calls for a constitutional amendment to dismantle super PACs and for the Supreme Court to revisit Citizens United.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also a speech by Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republican minority in the Senate, who likened the Obama campaign's complaints about conservative megadonors to President Nixon's so-called enemies list. McConnell praised Citizens United as a victory for free speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hearing the word ''free'' in this context was the most surreal wrinkle of all, because right now we're shackled to a system that demeans the people running for office, corrodes voters' trust in them and doesn't do any honor to this democracy of ours.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bob Kerrey left the Senate after two terms in 2001 -- mainly, he says now, so he could remarry and start a new family away from politics -- he was considered a statesmanlike and contemplative presence in a city that still valued both qualities. Kerrey had been a serious presidential candidate, a respected voice on health care and intelligence and co-chairman of one of those bipartisan commissions to reform entitlement programs. His closest friends included the small crowd of Vietnam veterans from both parties -- John McCain, John Kerry, Chuck Hagel, Chuck Robb, Max Cleland -- for whom party loyalty seemed well down the list of daily concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of that group, only the two failed presidential nominees remain, and McCain, once a symbol of independence, seems like a changed man, seething with partisan bitterness. A half-dozen of the Senate's other remaining centrists -- including Ben Nelson, the Democrat who took the Nebraska seat Kerrey vacated in 2001 -- are leaving voluntarily at the beginning of next year, and another, Richard Lugar, was just kicked to the curb in a divisive primary after 36 years of service. On the issues Kerrey says he cares most about, namely entitlements and debt reduction, efforts to find some bipartisan accord have gone nowhere, and those senators who try hardest to bridge the divide seem increasingly beaten down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet here is Bob Kerrey, as he approaches his 69th birthday, returning to Nebraska after a decadelong hiatus in Greenwich Village as the president of The New School, determined to reclaim his seat and his voice in the debate. It's a decision that puzzles most of Washington. Last month, as we traveled around Nebraska in a wobbly six-seat plane, I suggested to Kerrey that he was like a guy trying to angle his way back into a disaster zone while his like-minded colleagues were desperately seeking safe passage out. He laughed but didn't dispute the point. ''That's a disturbing metaphor,'' Kerrey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic leaders in Washington pleaded with Kerrey to run, because he is still the closest thing they have to a star attraction in Nebraska. Harry Reid, the majority leader, even promised to consider Kerrey's previous service when it comes time to dole out committee assignments. But ''just about everybody else who lives in Washington told me not to do it,'' Kerrey admitted. ''They just said the place has become too toxic and you can't get things done.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerrey insists he isn't seeking the Senate seat out of restlessness. (He was offered the chance to become the movie industry's top lobbyist in 2010 and recently became chairman of GlobalScholar, a for-profit education-software venture.) Nor is he mired in some late-life crisis, trying to reclaim his glory years. It is simply, Kerrey says, a calling to try to lead the Senate toward some consensus. ''It's not that nobody's doing it,'' he told me. ''It's just I feel the need to do it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This sounds plausible enough coming from a Medal of Honor recipient who spent the better part of two decades in public office. Still it makes you wonder whether Bob Kerrey is deluding himself about what he can achieve if he somehow is elected. There are moments when Kerrey himself seems uncertain of the answer. When a Democrat in North Platte pressed him on whether Washington could make any progress in a bipartisan way, Kerrey's thoughts seemed momentarily to slip past his internal censor. ''One of the concerns I've got, literally, is: Am I going to be miserable if I win?'' he said. But later, when we were discussing his decision, Kerrey sounded more hopeful. ''When you're standing somewhere else, things look different. It's good to come back if you can.'' He paused. ''And if you can't, that's fine too.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I met up with Kerrey in Omaha on the morning after he officially became the Democratic nominee, and we immediately set out on a nine-city tour across the state, mostly short stops where he could address local reporters in airport hangars or conference rooms before climbing back aboard the plane. He had lost the all-black get-up he sometimes wore in New York and had on a white shirt and conservative blue tie, blue blazer and gray slacks. Since his days in the Senate, Kerrey's hair has turned completely white, and he immediately brought to mind John Slattery's character from ''Mad Men,'' in his physical resemblance and in his impolitic brand of humor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walking into the tiny airport in Kearney, Kerrey was greeted by Sue Parsons, a former civics teacher. ''I want to ask you what we do about Social Security,'' she said as he extended his hand. ''I mean, it sounds like it's in the tank, and I'm 58.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Your Social Security's fine,'' Kerrey assured her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''But what about my son?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Oh, he's screwed,'' Kerrey said. Then he asked where the cookies were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time Kerrey was on the ballot, Tom Foley was the House speaker and ''Seinfeld'' was America's No. 1 show. That means he has never practiced politics in the age of Twitter, when every offhanded quip can and will be used against you, usually in the space of an hour. It also means that a large chunk of the state's voters, especially the younger ones who might be more inclined to vote for a Democrat, know very little about him. Most of Kerrey's energy at the moment is directed at reintroducing himself to Nebraska, along with his wife, the screenwriter Sarah Paley, and the couple's 10-year-old son, Henry, neither of whom have ever lived there. On a car ride through rural North Platte, Kerrey chatted with the Republican city administrator, happily sharing teenage memories of eating cow testicles and seeing ranch hands get their eyes gouged out by rampaging bulls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But reconnecting, even with friends from his former life, can be harder than Kerrey anticipated. ''You don't want to meet?'' he asked an apparently reluctant supporter on a phone call. He sounded hurt. ''O.K., but look, 40 percent of what I'm doing here is to meet with old friends, because I'm staying here, win or lose. I'm spending a lot of time with old friends, for no other reason than to spend time with old friends.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerrey's long absence from the state -- his supposed abandonment of so-called Nebraska values in favor of whatever elitist witchcraft you practice in a brownstone near Washington Square Park -- has predictably become a central talking point for his opponent, a little-known state senator named Deb Fischer. During her primary against two better-financed opponents, Fischer, a cattle rancher from rural Valentine, won late support from Sarah Palin and from the Nebraska-born billionaire Joe Ricketts, whose super PAC bought more than $250,000 worth of TV ads on her behalf. Even as I arrived in Nebraska on primary night, Americans for Prosperity, the group founded by the conservative businessmen David and Charles Koch, was running a TV ad in Nebraska accusing Kerrey of ''ditching our state'' and ''pushing an East Coast liberal agenda.'' (''I don't know whose prosperity the Koch brothers are interested in,'' Kerrey told one audience. ''My guess is it's their prosperity, and they already look pretty prosperous to me.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the election season hasn't quite begun in earnest, early public polls showed Fischer ahead by double digits, and most of the people who handicap Senate races for a living consider Kerrey a long shot. Only 32 percent of Nebraskans now call themselves Democrats, compared with 48 percent who self-identify as Republicans, and Barack Obama is as popular in the state as corn blight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, it's hard to imagine that Kerrey won't at least make a competitive race of it -- which is probably why Americans for Prosperity and Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS spent more than a combined $200,000 attacking him in the first two weeks after the primary, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks ad expenditures. The advantage in registration among Republicans in the state doesn't tell the full story; while the number of Republicans has stayed about constant and the number of Democrats has dropped sharply since Kerrey last ran, the percentage of independent voters has nearly doubled. Theoretically, at least, these are Kerrey's kind of voters. And while Mitt Romney should carry the state without displacing a single pomaded hair, Nebraskans have a pretty solid history of splitting their votes between parties. Kerrey, who served as governor in the mid-1980s, initially won his seat in 1988, the year that George H. W. Bush trounced Michael Dukakis. Nelson succeeded him in 2001, even as the second Bush carried the state by nearly 30 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, while Fischer may appeal to Tea Party types as a conservative insurgent, she is relatively untested and entirely new to national issues, which means Kerrey is not the only one who has something to fear from the twittering masses. I mentioned in passing to Kerrey, as we walked on a tarmac, that I wouldn't want to be a state senator debating him on the intricacies of Medicare and terrorism. ''Neither would I,'' he flatly replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Democrats win in Nebraska, it's generally by running as far as they reasonably can from the national party. During the time I watched Kerrey campaign, his stump speech was constantly evolving, but he never failed to praise George H. W. Bush, whom he called ''a wonderful president.'' And while he says he supports Obama, Kerrey is sharply critical of the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think he misjudged the nature of the 2008 election and misdiagnosed the economic problem we were facing,'' Kerrey told me. ''And I think he gave Congress too much authority on the stimulus, and way too much of that was wasted.'' Kerrey would preserve the president's health care law, but he's frustrated at having to defend it. ''I shouldn't be the one explaining to Nebraskans what's in the Affordable Care Act,'' he said. ''What's it been, two years? It's a sign of a problem created not by me but by the man who's the primary architect of the legislation. They just did a terrible job of explaining it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he favors raising taxes on the rich, while also lowering some corporate rates, Kerrey disdains the current populist rhetoric that pervades the left and praises the generosity of the rich. ''My view is that the jerks in our society are evenly divided among all income categories,'' he said. ''I think it's important for rich people, especially on the Democratic side, to hear someone say thank you.'' I found myself wishing someone would give Bob Kerrey a speaking slot at the Democratic convention, just so I could experience a packed arena going dead quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most striking, perhaps, is Kerrey's contempt for the leadership of both parties in Washington, which makes him sound like some 1920s prairie populist. One of his central proposals calls for a constitutional amendment that would ban party caucuses in Congress and establish nonpartisan elections for the House and Senate, much like the unusual system that has governed Nebraska's Legislature since 1934. The amendment, as Kerrey envisions it, would also eliminate the unlimited campaign donations made permissible by the Supreme Court. Practically speaking, what all of this would mean, he says, is that there would be no ''party line'' to follow but rather coalitions based on ideology or shared interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might think all of this would unsettle the Democratic leaders who lobbied Kerrey to run in the first place. It really doesn't, though, because the chief goal of both parties is to hold power. Control of the Senate after November's elections will most likely come down to a margin of one or two seats, and Republicans and Democrats are defending territory where they're at a natural disadvantage. Republicans, for instance, are trying to keep a tenuous hold on seats in Massachusetts and Maine. And in addition to Nebraska, Democrats are scrambling to defend seats in Missouri, Montana and North Dakota, all of which stand a better-than-even chance of falling into Republican hands. What party leaders care about is recruiting a candidate who's well known and who can raise a ton of money, so that even if that candidate doesn't win, he will at least force Republicans to spend precious time and resources on a state they'd rather be able to take for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of which means that Kerrey could run around Nebraska calling for a constitutional amendment to reinstate the British crown, and Harry Reid would probably shrug and go back to eating lunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you manage to get yourself elected, of course, those expectations tend to change. When I asked Kerrey if he was really serious about slashing trillions of dollars from entitlement programs or trying to start a movement to ban party caucuses -- given that proposals like that would surely sour his relationship with senior Democrats -- he blinked at me for a moment. ''My guess is they'll think my proposals are wrong,'' he said. ''So we have an argument, that's all. Nobody's going to die. Nobody's going to haul me across the river and shoot me, like Burr did Hamilton.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This more or less summarizes the attitude that Kerrey and his fellow veterans brought to the Senate in decades past. However divisive the rhetoric became, there was some sizable cadre of senators on each side of the aisle that brought a sense of perspective to the debate; they understood the difference between losing a vote, or even your seat, and losing your life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Kerrey seems not to fully grasp about the current Senate, no matter how many of his friends warn him, is how little perspective can be found in the place. Most lawmakers in both the House and Senate behave as if losing power and the perks that come with it really does amount to dying, and so they're wary of making concessions on any major issue that might irritate their most ideological activists and donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere is the resistance to old-school compromise more glaring than in the case of the so-called Gang of Six, which includes a member of the Democratic leadership (Richard Durbin) and one of the Senate's most conservative Republicans (Tom Coburn). The gang has a rough framework for reducing the debt by something like $4 trillion, both by cutting entitlement spending and by rewriting the tax code; it's not fully worked out, but it's enough to serve as a rallying point for the center. More than a dozen Republican senators were initially supportive of the plan, but when Obama embraced it and conservatives like Rush Limbaugh erupted, virtually all of them backed away. Democrats have been more open to making some painful trade-offs, but even so, the party's top senators have been mostly hostile to the gang's work, and only four Democrats have tentatively joined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerrey is adamant about enacting a bipartisan debt-reduction deal like the one the gang has proposed. When I asked him why he thought he could achieve what others have failed, he said, ''I've actually given this a fair amount of thought,'' and then he let me in on his theory of success. ''It's got to be somewhat larger. You've got to get it to the 10-, 12-senator range. At that point, you can start to have an impact. ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This didn't seem especially revelatory. I pointed out that the nominal leaders of the Gang of Six -- the Democrat Mark Warner and the Republican Saxby Chambliss -- had been working to enlist more senators since the beginning, against their parties' wishes, and so far had managed to expand the core group to eight, or maybe nine, senators, depending on the week. Did Kerrey think the gang had selected the number six because it had a nice, cozy feel to it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Well, look, you may have to use back-bench tactics,'' Kerrey said, undeterred. By this he presumably meant the kind of procedural hurdles more often deployed in the House, whereby lawmakers -- most famously Newt Gingrich in the 1990s -- get their way by holding up votes and paralyzing the body. ''You may have to be more militant. You may have to use the same tactics that the extremes are using in order to shut things down. It's got to be that people take you seriously, and it's either going to be that they take you seriously because they respect your views or because they're afraid of you. And frankly, I prefer the second when it comes to actually getting something done.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy enough to mock this vision of guerrilla moderates taking over the Capitol. (''We're going to act like children until you start cooperating like adults!'') And yet if Kerrey manages to get himself elected, his timing may not be as bad as it seems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few Democratic senators I spoke with expressed hope that, despite Lugar's defeat in Indiana, the Tea Party fervor that gripped Congress last year was ebbing, which would give Republicans more room to negotiate on cuts and taxes. In recent weeks, the two sides have come together to support measures on such issues as extending the Export-Import Bank and streamlining drug approvals. ''There has been a shift,'' New York's Charles E. Schumer told me. ''Is it on the most pressing issues of the moment, like debt and taxes? No. But it's not post-office namings, either.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if it turns out that more senators are willing to challenge their own parties' orthodoxies in the year ahead, then what a re-emerging center of the Senate will most likely need, even more than an expanded quorum or a specific agenda, is leadership -- an elder statesman with national standing to play something like the role McCain played in the early part of the last decade, someone who can threaten to ''shut things down'' and be taken seriously. ''Bob is, in the most constructive sense, an iconoclast,'' Michael Bennet, Colorado's junior senator and a friend of Kerrey's, told me. ''He would instantly be a leader of people who want to pull this place back together again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 2001, about four months after he left the Senate, Kerrey saw his darkest secret explode into public view. In this magazine, and in an accompanying segment on ''60 Minutes,'' the journalist Gregory Vistica reported that while in Vietnam, Kerrey led his SEAL team on a mission in which more than a dozen unarmed women and children were massacred. The revelation set off protests at the New School, and although Kerrey spoke about the issue at length and later served on the commission that investigated the terrorist attacks of 2001, it also seemed to preclude his return to elective office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toward the end of one of our conversations, I asked Kerrey if he thought Fischer or any of the outside groups would use his war record against him. Kerrey shrugged and said he was prepared if they did, and then to my surprise, he tried to explain, at some length, how he thought the episode had changed his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're not the worst thing we've ever done in our lives, and there's a tendency to think that we are,'' he said. We were sitting alone on a patio in back of a coffee shop in Fremont, accompanied by chirping birds. ''People now look at me differently. They look at me more for who I really am, as opposed to this glamorous war-hero, Medal-of-Honor-recipient narrative that I don't think is truthful. To see me as somebody who may have done something heroic but also did something that was terrible, I think helps people adjust in their own lives to their own attitudes about war and bad behavior. Because we're not perfect people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked if that meant he was at peace with what had happened at Thanh Phong in 1969, and he shook his head. ''No,'' he said, almost inaudibly. ''No. No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There are times when I'm overwhelmed by sadness. There are times when it's almost like I'm having a heart attack. Yeah, there are times when I still feel the pain of that night. It's been very difficult. And in some ways it's a motivation to run for Senate. It contributes to my wanting to be a candidate, as opposed to it being a deterrent. Because I haven't been able to do much about it since I talked about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When I say I feel like I have a duty to serve,'' Kerrey said, looking directly at me, ''I have a duty to serve.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spend enough time around politicians, and you will find that their personal motives are hard to discern or disentangle. Perhaps, as Kerrey seemed to be suggesting, he feels a need to ''do something'' about the past, to ensure that he is not remembered for the worst thing he ever did. There's no doubt, too, that Kerrey, like just about all aging politicians of a certain caliber, feels he has unfinished business, things he wanted to achieve in office but didn't. And unlike most aging politicians, he's being offered the chance -- begged, really -- to go back and finish what he started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a good bet, though, that had Kerrey hung around the Senate for another term or come back to Washington as Hollywood's lobbyist, he wouldn't be a candidate now. It's his very distance from the disillusionment that is driving so many of his former colleagues to leave, his detachment from their daily sense of futility, that makes him think he can matter again. Bob Kerrey runs not despite his long absence from Washington, but because of it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Speaking by video from Pennsylvania to a crowd gathered at the Faith and Freedom Coalition conference here on Saturday, Mitt Romney presented himself as the antithesis of President Obama and his policies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his comments, Mr. Romney relied on conservative positions popular with his audience, the loyal contingent of Republicans whose turnout will be crucial for him in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to a question about how he would address Israel as president, Mr. Romney, who is in the midst of a six-state bus tour, said, &quot;I think by and large you can just look at the things the president's done and do the opposite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, however, did not mention the major shift in immigration policy announced Friday by the president. On Friday, Mr. Romney told reporters that he thought the new immigration policy would make it &quot;more difficult to reach a long-term solution,&quot; but stopped short of a wholesale disagreement with the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In introducing Mr. Romney on Saturday, Ralph Reed, the coalition chairman, tried to reinforce that division between Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama, which he called the &quot;sharpest contrast&quot; between candidates in any recent presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are as far apart on the issues people care about as east is from west,&quot; Mr. Reed said, referring to Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the differences is the health care law, the fate of which will be decided by the Supreme Court later this month. On Saturday, Mr. Romney characterized the health care package as a measure that could make government spending balloon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I talk to businesses day in and day out, and they're just overwhelmed with the uncertainty that's associated with Obamacare,&quot; Mr. Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Santorum, a former rival of Mr. Romney's, was more direct about his position on the president's decision on immigration, which would enable young migrants to obtain work permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought it was an arrogant power grab,&quot; Mr. Santorum said of the policy after his prepared speech, according to The Washington Post.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUAKERTOWN, Pa. - It was hoagie interruptus for Mitt Romney on Saturday afternoon in this small town north of Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney had plans to stop by a Wawa store here to pick up some sandwiches and greet some voters. But before he and his motorcade could arrive, roughly 200 protesters - led by former Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania - descended on the convenience store, and the Romney campaign diverted his bus to a different (and protest-free) Wawa in the same town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the convenience store, along with Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, Mr. Romney used a self-service touch screen to order a meatball hoagie, first dismissing a local television reporter's question about why he had switched Wawa locations at the last minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just to get a good sandwich,&quot; Mr. Romney replied, hesitating slightly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But minutes later, as he headed over to the counter to pay for his sandwich, he doubled back with a more cheeky answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think you asked me, why we're at this Wawa, instead of the other Wawa?&quot; Mr. Romney said, returning to the question. &quot;I understand I had a surrogate over there already, so we decided to pick a different place. My surrogate is former Governor Rendell, who said we could win Pennsylvania. I'm happy to hear that, so we're happy to be here and see some folks here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLEVELAND -- Framing his re-election bid as a stark choice between government action to lift the middle class and a return to Republican economic policies that he said had caused a deep recession, President Obama on Thursday called the presidential decision facing Americans a clear-cut one that will determine the long-term trajectory of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This November is your chance to render a verdict on the debate over how to grow the economy, how to create good jobs, how to pay down our deficit,'' Mr. Obama told enthusiastic supporters at Cuyahoga Community College here. ''Your vote will finally determine the path that we take as a nation -- not just tomorrow, but for years to come.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The address, by a president who sounded as if he realized he was in a fight for his political life, represented a determined effort to stem two weeks of political and economic sliding that began with a grim jobs report. It came on a day of political gamesmanship in this crucial swing state, as Mitt Romney, the president's rival, scheduled a speech 250 miles away in Republican-friendly Cincinnati in an effort to overshadow Mr. Obama and pre-emptively attack him for failing to revive the economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking shortly before Mr. Obama in remarks that, like the president's, were carried on cable news programs, Mr. Romney said Mr. Obama's re-election campaign felt compelled to deliver a major address on the economy ''because he hasn't delivered a recovery for the economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Now, I know that he will have all sorts of excuses, and he'll have all sorts of ideas he'll describe about how he'll make things better,'' Mr. Romney said. ''But what he says and what he does are not always the exact same thing. And so if people want to know how his economic policies have worked and how they perform, why they can talk to their neighbor and ask if things are better.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his remarks, the president acknowledged that divergent views between him and Mr. Romney on how to revive the economy would define the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is one place I stand in complete agreement with Mr. Romney,'' Mr. Obama said. ''This election is about our economic future.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president offered no new policy prescriptions in his speech, which he instead used to try to regain the offensive by contrasting his agenda with his own detailed account of the Republican alternative. Mr. Obama said the nation was slowly ''digging out of a hole that is nine million jobs deep,'' and he blamed Republican policies over the previous decade for driving up the deficit and benefiting the rich at the expense of the middle class. He said a Republican victory in November would mean a return to the ''theory that the best way to grow the economy is from the top down,'' and he called the election ''the make-or-break moment for America's middle class.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Point by point, the president listed the Bush-era economic and policy choices -- embraced by Mr. Romney and Congressional Republicans -- that he said had led to the recession of 2008 and 2009: tax cuts for the wealthy, deregulation, spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that was added to the deficit. ''I don't believe that the government is the answer to all of our problems,'' Mr. Obama said. But, he said, ''what is holding us back is not a lack of big ideas, not a matter of finding the right technical solution.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What is holding us back is a stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views between what direction America should take,'' Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, whose staff hastily moved up his speech so he could beat the president to the podium, said that private enterprise, not government, was the key to expanding the economy, and that the Obama administration's policies on financial regulation, health care and energy had stifled that growth and had held back the recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think he's made it harder for the American enterprise system to work,'' Mr. Romney said. ''And I want to change that. I want to make it once again, America once again the most attractive place in the world for job creators.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cleveland, the crowd of about 1,500 at the community college was kept purposely low because this was a ''speech, not a rally,'' campaign aides said. (Mr. Obama was buttoned up in a suit, looking somber, and he struck a serious tone throughout the address.) But many in the crowd acted as if they were at a rally anyway, doing the wave, chanting the ubiquitous ''fired up, ready to go'' slogan from Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign and interrupting his speech with raucous cheers and expressions of agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's remarks came as he is grappling with running for re-election as the national jobless rate remains above 8 percent, a daunting level for any incumbent president to overcome, particularly during a hyperpartisan campaign season in which every misstatement is amplified in a 24-hour news cycle. The president, who was hammered by Republicans last week for his statement that the private sector was doing fine, acknowledged the difficult environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There will be no shortage of gaffes and controversies that keep both campaigns busy and give the press something to write about,'' he said. ''You may have heard I recently made my own unique contribution to that process. It wasn't the first time; it won't be the last.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign sought to take advantage of Mr. Obama's comment last week and released a campaign advertisement on Thursday titled ''Doing Fine.'' The ad features a series of sour statistics (''23.2 Million Americans Are in Need of Work''; ''Millions of Homeowners Underwater on Mortgages''), and then follows up, repeatedly, with video and audio of Mr. Obama telling reporters during a news conference that ''the private sector is doing fine.'' It closes with ominous text: ''How Can President Obama Fix Our Economy... if He Doesn't Understand It's Broken?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign fired back, releasing a Web video with a highlight reel of Mr. Romney's own off-key moments. ''Corporations are people too, my friend''; ''I like being able to fire people''; ''I'm also unemployed''; ''Some of my best friends are Nascar team owners'' -- all featured in a one-minute nonstop aria of political miscues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The simultaneous visits to Ohio showed just how crucial the state's 18 electoral votes are considered to be in the fall election. Polls show that the men are in a virtual dead heat in the state. For myriad reasons, Ohio tends to be a predictor of the presidential race, but the state is an outlier in some ways. The unemployment rate here, at 7.4 percent, is almost a point below the national rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Cleveland, Mr. Obama headed to New York on another money run, this one a fund-raiser at the home of Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick, co-hosted by the Vogue editor Anna Wintour.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney steals a trick from an unlikely source for his latest ad: President Obama. But in this case, imitation is more mockery than the sincerest form of flattery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new 30-second Romney campaign commercial called ''Doing Fine'' copies the music, pacing and script nearly verbatim from a 2008 Obama&nbsp;ad that took Senator John McCain to task for his well-known remark that ''the fundamentals of our economy are strong.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the new ad, the Romney campaign takes the president's recent statement - ''the private sector is doing fine'' - and uses it to make him appear out of touch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewers see a litany of depressing economic statistics: 23.2 million Americans looking for work; 40 straight months of over 8 percent unemployment; millions of homeowners with mortgages underwater. Then the president is shown behind the lectern in the White House briefing room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The text on screen asks incredulously: ''The private sector is doing fine? How can President Obama fix our economy if he doesn't understand it's broken?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2008 Obama&nbsp;ad, the setup was the same. Viewers were shown a raft of numbers and grim facts, although more devastating ones: 605,000 jobs lost; the collapse of Lehman Brothers; 9,800 home foreclosures a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the kicker? Sub Mr. McCain's name for the president's: ''How can John McCain fix our economy if he doesn't understand it's broken?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hong Kong Exchange to Buy London Metal Exchange for $2.1 Billion &nbsp;|&nbsp; Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing agreed on Friday to buy the London Metal Exchange for &pound;1.38 billion ($2.14 billion), as the Asian bourse outbid several American rivals for control of the 135-year-old London firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move by the Hong Kong exchange, one of the world's biggest financial bourses based on market capitalization, to buy the L.M.E. is another sign of the mounting importance of Asia in the world's commodities industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Asian exchange will pay &pound;107.60 for each share in the L.M.E. in a deal that will be presented to the London exchange's shareholders by the end of July, according to a statement from the Hong Kong-based company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 50 percent of the L.M.E.'s shareholders, who hold more than 75 percent of the firm's stock, must approve the deal. The acquisition could provide a windfall for JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which own a combined 20.4 percent stake in the London exchange, though the deal could face opposition from smaller investors, who may balk at a potential rise in trading fees after the deal is completed.<BR>DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt's Disarray Puts a Regional Investment Bank in Play &nbsp;|&nbsp; Yasser el-Mallawany and Hassan Heikal are accustomed to turmoil. In recent years, they have steered EFG-Hermes through political upheaval, economic pain and market volatility, transforming the Egyptian financial firm into the leading investment bank in the Arab world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the investment bankers face their own crisis. As deals dry up, Mr. Mallawany and Mr. Heikal are scrambling to sell a large piece of the business to a smaller rival in the gas-rich state of Qatar, which would give the firm capital to survive the current turbulence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We needed someone to support the investment banking business,&quot; Mr. Mallawany said in a telephone interview, predicting that the business climate would be difficult &quot;for the next two to three years.&quot;<BR>DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>

This time it would use money, not guns, to accomplish the goal. There is, let me hasten to note, no evidence of any such conspiracy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a set of dueling speeches Thursday in Ohio, President Obama and Mitt Romney highlighted the state's ongoing role as a political kingmaker and center of this year's election fight over the condition of the economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney opened up in Cincinnati, telling a crowd inside an equipment manufacturer that Obama's economic policies have made it harder for businesses to hire and made the economy worse. The president, Romney said at Seilkop Industries, was &quot;going to be delivering a speech on the economy  because he hasn't delivered a recovery for the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's going to be a person of eloquence as he describes his plans for making the economy better, but don't forget, he's been president for 3 years,&quot; Romney said. &quot;And talk is cheap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cleveland, Obama used his 54-minute speech to cast the upcoming presidential election as a choice between his defense of the middle class and Romney's plans to put the wealthy and businesses first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this election, you have two very different visions to choose from,&quot; Obama told about 1,500 supporters at Cuyahoga Community College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't some abstract debate. This isn't another trivial Washington argument,&quot; Obama said. &quot;This is a make-or-break moment for our middle class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's re-election campaign chose Cleveland for the speech because Ohio has benefited from administration policies, such as the bailout of the Big Three automakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama visited Ohio for official policy in his first 2 years in office more than any place other than the Washington, D.C., area. He also added numerous trips there in 2010 to campaign for then-governor Ted Strickland, a Democrat who lost to Republican John Kasich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and Romney poll neck and neck in Ohio, where the unemployment rate was 7.4% in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns, as well as PACs and interest groups that support them, have flooded the airwaves in the Buckeye State. Of the $11.3 million spent nationwide the week of May 28-June 3, more than $2 million was in Ohio media markets, according to data from The Washington Post and Campaign Media Analysis Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans conducted a conference call Wednesday afternoon to criticize Obama's policies and launched a TV ad Thursday morning that targeted Obama's comment last week that the private sector was &quot;doing fine&quot; in comparison to state and local governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama fired back at the criticism during his speech and acknowledged a series of frequent GOP attacks on his presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other side will spend over a billion dollars on ads that tell you the economy is bad, that it's all my fault  because I think everything and everybody is doing just fine,&quot; he said. &quot;Well, you know, that may be their plan to win the election, but it's not a plan to create jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the candidates did not cross paths, the relatively close proximity of the speeches gave way to mischief on the part of the Romney campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the hours before the president's speech, a Romney campaign bus was seen circling the venue and honking at Obama supporters as they waited in line to hear the president speak. <BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As McCain did in 2008, Obama and his campaign have argued that the remark should be placed in context.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Proud' JPMorgan Chief Apologizes &nbsp;|&nbsp; Jamie Dimon, the outspoken chief executive of JPMorgan Chase under scrutiny for a multibillion-dollar trading loss at his firm, apologized for the problems on Wednesday even as he mounted a fierce defense of his bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testifying at a much-anticipated hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Dimon said that he was &quot;proud&quot; of the bank, highlighting the firm's &quot;fortress&quot; balance sheet and its performance during the financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're doing what a bank is supposed to do,&quot; he told a panel of lawmakers, few of whom posed combative questions during the roughly two-hour hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing on Wednesday was the latest chapter of the trading debacle, which has stained the bank's reputation and prompted wide-ranging inquiries from regulators and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The concerns have centered on the bank's chief investment office, which placed a big bet tied to credit derivatives that eventually soured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the controversy plaguing the bank, Mr. Dimon on Wednesday navigated the hearing with relative ease, deflecting tough questions and fielding softball inquiries. He received a particularly warm welcome from Republican senators, who praised JPMorgan and allowed the chief executive to offer criticisms of forthcoming financial rules. <BR>DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>

One of the big questions is whether the loser trades were really, as Mr. Dimon claims, hedges intended to protect against potential losses on other of the bank's positions, or proprietary trades - speculative bets - placed for profit.&quot;<BR>NEW YORK TIMES&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The geographic terrain of the 2012 presidential campaign will narrow on Thursday to a 250-mile stretch in Ohio between Cleveland and Cincinnati, the two cities that will play host to dueling events by President Obama and Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men will give speeches in Ohio, an important swing state, just five minutes apart, creating a kind of political split-screen moment that will become more common in the months ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 1:45 p.m. Eastern time, Mr. Obama will speak at the Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, on what his campaign promises will be an effort to contrast two different visions for the country's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other side's plan is a $5 trillion tax cut that explodes the deficit while gutting the investments we need to grow,&quot; Jay Carney, the president's press secretary, told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr. Romney will be at Seilkop Industries in Cincinnati, where aides said he would continue laying out what he would do on Day 1 if elected. The list includes dismantling regulations and the health care law and approving the Keystone pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Really, at the end, the biggest difference is with Governor Romney you are going to have a president who won't be hostile to job creators,&quot; Russ Schriefer, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, told reporters on Wednesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrival of both presidential campaigns to Ohio underscores the importance of the state's 18 electoral votes in the fall election. Both camps are planning to pour resources into advertisements and voter-turnout efforts to ensure a victory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the messages in Ohio may be different than they are elsewhere in the country. Unlike some other parts of the economically struggling Rust Belt, Ohio is doing better: unemployment is below the national average. The natural gas industry in the state is booming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Romney, the turnaround in Ohio could complicate his efforts to portray the president as having failed to coax the country back to economic health. Voters in the state may be less inclined to view the president's tenure through the same grim lens as residents of other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But aides said on Wednesday that Mr. Romney will give credit for the improving local economic situation to John R. Kasich, Ohio's Republican governor, and not to Mr. Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you have Republican governors who encourage business, things are better,&quot; Mr. Schriefer said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem is they still have this weight of the White House and the Obama administration on top of them,&quot; he added. &quot;This weight of an uncertain future, of Obamacare, of what regulation are they going to think up next.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Obama, Ohio offers a test of his efforts to make the presidential election a stark choice between Mr. Romney's policies and his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to the president said Wednesday that Mr. Obama will use his speech in Cleveland to portray his Republican rival as the proponent of a trickle-down philosophy of economics in which lax regulations and lower taxes will help the free market solve everyone's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president believes the economy grows not from the top down, but from the middle class up, and he has an economic plan to do that,&quot; an adviser to the president's campaign said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge for the president,as noted by Helene Cooper in The Times Thursday morning, is to communicate that aggressive message while defending himself against charges that he is out of touch with those Americans who are struggling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more Mr. Obama goes to a place like Ohio and spotlights the economic recovery there, the more Mr. Romney and his allies will accuse the president of being blind to the serious troubles elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the trap that Mr. Obama found himself in last week when he tried to draw a distinction between the relative health of the private and public sector economies. Saying the &quot;private sector is doing fine,&quot; immediately opened himself up to charges that he didn't understand the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That will be the main argument on Thursday as the two men come about as close as they've ever been to an in-person debate about their economic ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At some point this fall, they will debate each other on three separate occasions, providing the best chance for the public to weigh their arguments side by side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until then, Thursday's long-distance face-off in Ohio will just have to do.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney steals a trick from an unlikely source for his latest ad: President Obama. But in this case, imitation is more mockery than the sincerest form of flattery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new 30-second Romney campaign commercial called &quot;Doing Fine&quot; copies the music, pacing and script nearly verbatim from a 2008 Obama&nbsp;ad&nbsp;that took Senator John McCain to task for his well-known remark that &quot;the fundamentals of our economy are strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the new ad, the Romney campaign&nbsp;takes the president's recent statement&nbsp;- &quot;the private sector is doing fine&quot;&nbsp;- and uses it to make him appear out of touch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewers see a litany of depressing economic statistics: 23.2 million Americans looking for work; 40 straight months of over 8 percent unemployment; millions of homeowners with mortgages underwater. Then the president is shown behind the lectern in the White House briefing room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The text on screen asks incredulously: &quot;The private sector is doing fine? How can President Obama fix our economy if he doesn't understand it's broken?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2008 Obama&nbsp;ad, the setup was the same. Viewers were shown a raft of numbers and grim facts, although more devastating ones: 605,000 jobs lost; the collapse of Lehman Brothers; 9,800 home foreclosures a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the kicker? Sub Mr. McCain's name for the president's: &quot;How can John McCain fix our economy if he doesn't understand it's broken?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who became a champion to conservatives after fending off a recall effort last week, offered a bit of advice to Mitt Romney: Refine your economic message and give people a reason to vote for you, rather than simply against President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know that voters are there yet with Governor Romney,&quot; Mr. Walker said on Thursday. &quot;It doesn't mean that he doesn't talk about it, it doesn't mean that he hasn't thought about it, but I think he's got to have a simple message of not only why we need to replace the current occupant in the White House, but also why he would be better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Walker, who has emerged as a leading voice in the Republican Party after becoming the nation's first governor to survive a recall, said Mr. Romney needed to broaden his appeal beyond Republicans to carry Wisconsin in November. He urged Mr. Romney to take a lesson from what voters demanded in his race and brand himself as someone who is committed to tackling government spending and other difficult issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Romney's going to have a shot in our state, you can't win with just Republican votes,&quot; Mr. Walker said, speaking at a breakfast sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor. &quot;He's got to get beyond the Republicans. He's got to be viewed as a reformer, somebody who is going to make life better and put our state and country back on track.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;He's got a shot, but my win alone is not enough, he's got to build off that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an hourlong session with reporters on Thursday during a visit to Washington, Mr. Walker said he believed Wisconsin would resume its role as a key battleground in the fall. Democrats have won the last six presidential elections in the state, but he said the 2012 race could be just as competitive as 2000 and 2004, when George W. Bush lost by a narrow margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our state is going to flip back and forth between now and November,&quot; Mr. Walker said. &quot;There will be polls one week that show Romney up and polls that show the president up the next week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Walker is the latest Republican to gently urge Mr. Romney to take a bolder approach in his campaign against Mr. Obama. The 10 electoral votes in Wisconsin, which Mr. Obama easily won four years ago, could be more competitive given the combustible political environment in Wisconsin after Democrats failed in their effort to recall Mr. Walker, who cut collective bargaining rights for most of the state's public workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney is visiting Wisconsin on Monday as part of a five-day tour through crucial swing states. His campaign is eager to encroach on the terrain that Mr. Obama carried four years ago, hoping to expand the battleground map of states that Democrats need to defend.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Speaking at a family-owned factory in Cincinnati, Mitt Romney tried to take the steam out of President Obama's economic speech. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CINCINNATI -- Mitt Romney, seeking to overshadow an appearance by the president in Ohio on Thursday, mocked President Obama as a candidate of words, not deeds, whose eloquent speechmaking abilities have not been matched by the effectiveness of his economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giving his own economic speech in the same state where Mr. Obama was presenting his, Mr. Romney said that the president's re-election campaign felt compelled to deliver a major address on the economy &quot;because he hasn't delivered a recovery for the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I know that he will have all sorts of excuses, and he'll have all sorts of ideas he'll describe about how he'll make things better,&quot; Mr. Romney said. &quot;But what he says and what he does are not always the exact same thing. And so if people want to know how his economic policies have worked and how they perform, why they can talk to their neighbor and ask if things are better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you look at the president's record, it is long on words and short on action that created jobs,&quot; Mr. Romney said during a speech here at a family-owned factory that manufactures industrial products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, whose staff hastily moved up the timing of his speech to beat Mr. Obama to the podium, assailed Mr. Obama's health care overhaul, financial regulation, energy policies and approach to international trade agreements as hostile to businesses and obstacles to an economic recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on Americans to judge the president on his record, not his rhetoric. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my experience in thinking about people who I want to have work for me, whether it's my doctor or the person that's going to be painting the house, I want to make sure they do a good job the first time,&quot; he said. &quot;And if they didn't, I want someone who can do a better job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he has in the past, Mr. Romney pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act, pursue punitive trade policies against China and approve a pipeline that would carry oil to the United States from Canada, which the Obama administration has delayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I have to build it myself to get it here, I'll get that oil into America,&quot; Mr. Romney said of the pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign is seeking to portray Mr. Obama as increasingly out of touch with the harsh economic reality facing ordinary Americans, deploying a critique that Democrats have long made against Mr. Romney. Aides argue that Mr. Obama has opened himself to such a line of attack by declaring that the &quot;private sector is doing fine,&quot; a line that Mr. Romney has repeated, daily, for the past week in assailing the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, his campaign issued its third advertisement featuring a clip of the president making the remark, which it juxtaposed with a litany of grim economic statistics and newspaper headlines. &quot;How can President Obama fix our economy,&quot; the ad asks, &quot;if he doesn't understand it's broken?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon has been a scourge of the Obama administration in recent months, but when he appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Republicans found the head of the country's largest bank to be alarmingly off-message.           Dimon had little interest in joining Republicans in complaining that President Obama's regulations  destroyed capitalism as they knew it. In fact, he even had some kind words for the Dodd-Frank financial reforms. And the banker's most passionate plea to the lawmakers was one that Republicans most emphatically don't want to hear: Enact the Simpson-Bowles debt proposal, a package of spending cuts and - gulp - increased tax revenue that was largely scuttled by House Republicans.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we had done something remotely like Simpson-Bowles,&quot; Dimon said in response to Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) at the end of the hearing, &quot;you would have increased confidence in America. You would have shown a real fix of the long-term fiscal problem. I think you would have had . . . a more effective tax system that is conducive to economic growth.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, he said, not enacting such a plan &quot;helped cause a downturn last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ostensibly, Dimon went to Capitol Hill to be grilled about his bank's loss of more than $2 billion on an investment strategy that amounted to a glorified game of craps. Members of the Senate banking committee were to determine whether stronger financial regulations would be needed to prevent such gambling. But tougher regulation is unlikely, given Wall Street's bankrolling of panel members' campaigns, and lawmakers acted as though they were wholly owned subsidiaries of JPMorgan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Dimon,&quot; said Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.), it &quot;occurs to me that an enterprise as big and powerful as yours, you've got a lot of firepower and you're - you're just huge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're obviously renowned, rightfully so, I think,&quot; contributed Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), &quot;as being one of the most, you know, one of the best CEOs in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats, perhaps worried that Wall Street has been shifting its campaign largess to Mitt Romney and the Republicans, joined the sycophancy sweepstakes. Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.) called JPMorgan Chase &quot;one of the nation's finest,&quot; and Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.) told Dimon: &quot;You guys know the industry better than anybody sitting up here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But who could keep pace with Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), who said, &quot;We can hardly sit in judgment of your losing $2 billion&quot;? The apparently awestruck senator stammered: &quot;I - I - I think we do need to recognize that you are a very big bank, the biggest in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all the affirmations of how very big and large and huge and great and powerful Dimon is, he declined to join their all-out assault on the Wall Street reforms. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Has Dodd-Frank more than marginally made our banking system safer?&quot; Corker asked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know we supported some elements - &quot; Dimon began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know what you supported,&quot; Corker snapped. &quot;Has it made our financial system safer?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think parts of it, in conjunction with higher capital liquidity,&quot; the executive replied. &quot;The financial system is safer today than it was in '07.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) asked if he could paraphrase Dimon's answer as &quot;the financial system is safer today, and you can't say that Dodd-Frank has helped at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dimon repeated his admission that &quot;Dodd-Frank and other things made it safer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He acknowledged that the &quot;Volcker rule,&quot; a proposed regulation that would sharply limit banks' trading, &quot;may very well have stopped parts&quot; of Morgan's losing bets. He conceded that regulators have made &quot;improvements in companies, including JPMorgan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johanns asked whether Dodd-Frank created red tape &quot;so hard to navigate&quot; that banks leave the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to be fine ourselves,&quot; Dimon replied. &quot;We'll be able to navigate all that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't as if the banker suddenly loved the regulatory state; he said the Volcker rule is &quot;unnecessary.&quot; And although his prepared remarks were stocked with contrition (&quot;We've let a lot of people down and we are very sorry&quot;), his trademark arrogance returned when confronted by the only tough questioner, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). Dimon, speaking over Merkley, said the senator was &quot;misinformed&quot; and relying on &quot;factually wrong&quot; analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this time, Dimon had a more deserving target for his criticism than Democrats and regulations: a demand to &quot;get our fiscal act in order&quot; before the election and before automatic tax increases take effect next year. The Simpson-Bowles plan &quot;is a road map which I like,&quot; he said, and the important thing is &quot;getting something like that done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Dimon is the senators' best friend, as their fawning suggests, perhaps they'll take this advice seriously. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A robust television ad campaign is a critical element in winning an election, which explains why the Obama and Romney campaigns and their parties and allies are in the midst of unleashing the most sustained and concentrated blitz of 30-second commercials in American political history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for all of the cash thrown at presidential TV ads - perhaps more than $1 billion between now and November - their impact has historically been relatively small in swaying large swaths of voters in the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most fundamental point about political advertising is that it matters at the margins,&quot; said Erika Franklin Fowler, director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks and analyzes campaign ads. &quot;It might help in a close election,&quot; but factors such as the state of the economy and partisan identification are much more influential, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if that is so, it raises a fundamental question: Why do presidential campaigns devote such resources to an effort that allegedly yields so little? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer may be that they can't afford not to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The risk of losing even a fraction of the vote by being outspent on advertising largely drives the relentless fundraising and spending of both parties, says Travis N. Ridout, a political scientist at Washington State University. &quot;You don't want to be left behind,&quot; Ridout said. &quot;No one is willing to unilaterally disarm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ask Al Gore if a small advantage matters,&quot; said Ken Goldstein, president of the ad-tracking firm Campaign Media Analysis Group of Washington, referring to Gore's 540-vote loss in Florida in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local TV advertising will consume about half of all the dollars raised by the candidates, their parties and the independent super PACs that are the wild card in this year's campaign, Goldstein estimates. That means at least $1 billion will be spent on TV spots in just a dozen or so swing states that could determine the election. Others guess more - lots more: Bill Burton, a former aide to President Obama, told New York magazine last month that the total raised this year could top $2.6 billion, with much of that total ticketed for advertising. with two-thirds of that ticketed for advertising. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fundraising figures released by Obama and Republican contender Mitt Romney last week haven't challenged the most-expensive-election-ever narrative. Romney and his party raised more than $76 million last month, outdrawing Obama and Democrats, who hauled in $60 million. Romney is also getting help from Republican-leaning super PACs that have raised far more than their Democratic-leaning counterparts. (Advertising strategists for Romney and Obama declined to comment for this article).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notion that all that TV money will buy relatively little is almost as old as TV itself. Dozens of academic examinations since the 1940s have shown that TV ads have limited persuasive effects on voters in general elections, often accounting for no more than a 1 or 2 percent difference, and often considerably less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, outspending a rival on advertising in a general-election campaign doesn't guarantee anything; John Kerry and his Democratic allies ran almost 200,000 more commercials than George W. Bush did in 2004 and lost in a close election. On the other hand, Obama had a narrower advertising advantage over Sen. John McCain in 2008 and won relatively easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political operatives and campaign media advisers don't dispute the general notion of limited impact. But only a few openly question the proliferating ad wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More money is spent on television advertising than any other element of presidential campaigns, and yet it provides the worst return on investment,&quot; said Mark McKinnon, the chief media adviser for Bush's presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004 and an early adviser to McCain in 2008. &quot;I think you could take 90 percent of the spending on television ads and flush it and still have the same net impact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One illuminating illustration came in a study of the 2008 race by researchers at Washington State and Bowdoin College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study compared the vote totals of the candidates in counties in &quot;battleground&quot; states with their totals in counties just across the border in safely red or blue states. People in the latter counties saw the same ads as voters in the battleground counties but weren't subjected to other kinds of campaign messages and activities, such as phone calls, mail or visits by home campaign workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On average, a candidate who dominated advertising in a region raised his vote total by just 0.5 percent in the control group of voters in non-battleground counties, Ridout and fellow researcher Michael M. Franz found. They concluded that advertising &quot;is responsible for only a small portion of the final result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A University of Texas study of the 2000 and 2004 races found that Bush improved his standing by just 0.1 percent under virtually similar circumstances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to say that an advertising blitz can't sometimes play a definitive role in some races - or in certain stages of races. Advertising, for example, appears to play a far bigger role in primary and local elections where the candidates aren't as well known to voters and where a well-funded campaign can overwhelm poorer rivals. Gregg Phillips experienced the phenomenon firsthand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phillips managed Winning Our Future, the super PAC that backed former House speaker Newt Gingrich in this year's Republican primaries. He points out that Romney and the independent group backing him all but buried his GOP opponents, particularly Gingrich, in the Florida primary in late January. Romney and his backers spent more than $11 million on TV ads, compared with less than $2 million by Gingrich. &quot;Newt said, 'I threw the kitchen sink at him, but Romney threw a bigger sink at me,' &quot; Phillips said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phillips and other strategists acknowledge that ads don't work the same way in a general election. By the summer and fall of an election year, the major candidates are usually well known, and TV advertising is just one way people form perceptions about them. There are many other sources of information: constant news coverage, campaign rallies, phone calls and home visits by campaign workers, as well as input from friends, family and co-workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign media advisers say that waging a modern presidential ad campaign is like swinging a giant hammer at a penny nail. Almost all of the commercials are aimed at a minority of a minority of voters: the few who haven't yet made up their minds in a handful of battleground states. A Gallup poll of likely voters in 12 such swing states in early May found that only 7 percent described themselves as undecided. And the number shrinks the closer it gets to Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TV ads affect &quot;a narrow sliver of voters in a very narrow segment of the country,&quot; says Steve McMahon, who directed former Vermont governor Howard Dean's primary advertising in 2004 and the Democratic National Committee's general-election ads in 2008. &quot;Those people receive information in lots of ways, and ads are just one way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McMahon says advertising is a key part of a candidate's communications strategy. &quot;All those [messages] create an orchestra. If your campaign is working, all the pieces come together,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMahon says the great danger for any campaign is to lose your &quot;share of voice&quot; - the ability to match or exceed an opponent's advertising. Such imbalances could crop up more frequently in this election because of unlimited spending by super PACs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the bulk of 30-second ads will be directed to a limited number of cities, broadcast stations and programs, the candidates have better ways than ever to target different sets of voters. Local cable stations make it possible to reach narrow subsets of voters, such as Latinos watching Telemundo in Tampa or African Americans watching BET in northern Ohio. Although the Internet is a growing source of targeted campaign advertising, it remains a distant second to traditional broadcasting, said Wesleyan Media Project's Fowler. In part, this is because TV ads are passive, whereas Internet ads require a viewer to click and play - a potential barrier, she notes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet there's little evidence that a memorable TV ad or series of ads can on their own change the dynamic of a presidential race. One of the most famous - Lyndon Johnson's &quot;Daisy&quot; commercial in 1964, in which Johnson implied that his Republican opponent, Sen. Barry Goldwater, would put the world at risk of nuclear war - didn't change Johnson's standing in the polls from the time the ad aired in early September until Election Day. Similarly, the four &quot;Swift Boat&quot; ads that attacked Kerry's war record and integrity in August 2004 had little prolonged impact. Kerry's poll numbers rose and fell before the ads began - and rose and fell right up until the election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon has been a scourge of the Obama administration in recent months, but when he appeared on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Republicans found the head of the country's largest bank to be alarmingly off-message. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dimon had little interest in joining Republicans in complaining that President Obama's regulations  destroyed capitalism as they knew it. In fact, he even had some kind words for the Dodd-Frank financial reforms. And the banker's most passionate plea to the lawmakers was one that Republicans most emphatically don't want to hear: Enact the Simpson-Bowles debt proposal, a package of spending cuts and - gulp - increased tax revenue that was largely scuttled by House Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we had done something remotely like Simpson-Bowles,&quot; Dimon said in response to Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) at the end of the hearing, &quot;you would have increased confidence in America. You would have shown a real fix of the long-term fiscal problem. I think you would have had . . . a more effective tax system that is conducive to economic growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, he said, not enacting such a plan &quot;helped cause a downturn last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ostensibly, Dimon went to Capitol Hill to be grilled about his bank's loss of more than $2 billion on an investment strategy that amounted to a glorified game of craps. Members of the Senate banking committee were to determine whether stronger financial regulations would be needed to prevent such gambling. But tougher regulation is unlikely, given Wall Street's bankrolling of panel members' campaigns, and lawmakers acted as though they were wholly owned subsidiaries of JPMorgan. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local TV advertising will consume about half of all the dollars raised by the candidates, their parties and the independent super PACs that are the wild card in this year's campaign, Goldstein estimates. That means at least $1 billion will be spent on TV spots in just a dozen or so swing states that could determine the election. Others guess more - lots more: Bill Burton, a former aide to President Obama, told New York magazine last month that the total raised this year could top $2.6 billion, with much of that total ticketed for advertising. with two-thirds of that ticketed for advertising. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fundraising figures released by Obama and Republican contender Mitt Romney last week haven't challenged the most-expensive-election-ever narrative. Romney and his party raised more than $76 million last month, outdrawing Obama and Democrats, who hauled in $60 million. Romney is also getting help from Republican-leaning super PACs that have raised far more than their Democratic-leaning counterparts. (Advertising strategists for Romney and Obama declined to comment for this article).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notion that all that TV money will buy relatively little is almost as old as TV itself. Dozens of academic examinations since the 1940s have shown that TV ads have limited persuasive effects on voters in general elections, often accounting for no more than a 1 or 2 percent difference, and often considerably less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, outspending a rival on advertising in a general-election campaign doesn't guarantee anything; John Kerry and his Democratic allies ran almost 200,000 more commercials than George W. Bush did in 2004 and lost in a close election. On the other hand, Obama had a narrower advertising advantage over Sen. John McCain in 2008 and won relatively easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political operatives and campaign media advisers don't dispute the general notion of limited impact. But only a few openly question the proliferating ad wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More money is spent on television advertising than any other element of presidential campaigns, and yet it provides the worst return on investment,&quot; said Mark McKinnon, the chief media adviser for Bush's presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004 and an early adviser to McCain in 2008. &quot;I think you could take 90 percent of the spending on television ads and flush it and still have the same net impact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One illuminating illustration came in a study of the 2008 race by researchers at Washington State and Bowdoin College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study compared the vote totals of the candidates in counties in &quot;battleground&quot; states with their totals in counties just across the border in safely red or blue states. People in the latter counties saw the same ads as voters in the battleground counties but weren't subjected to other kinds of campaign messages and activities, such as phone calls, mail or visits by home campaign workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On average, a candidate who dominated advertising in a region raised his vote total by just 0.5 percent in the control group of voters in non-battleground counties, Ridout and fellow researcher Michael M. Franz found. They concluded that advertising &quot;is responsible for only a small portion of the final result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A University of Texas study of the 2000 and 2004 races found that Bush improved his standing by just 0.1 percent under virtually similar circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to say that an advertising blitz can't sometimes play a definitive role in some races - or in certain stages of races. Advertising, for example, appears to play a far bigger role in primary and local elections where the candidates aren't as well known to voters and where a well-funded campaign can overwhelm poorer rivals. Gregg Phillips experienced the phenomenon firsthand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phillips managed Winning Our Future, the super PAC that backed former House speaker Newt Gingrich in this year's Republican primaries. He points out that Romney and the independent group backing him all but buried his GOP opponents, particularly Gingrich, in the Florida primary in late January. Romney and his backers spent more than $11 million on TV ads, compared with less than $2 million by Gingrich. &quot;Newt said, 'I threw the kitchen sink at him, but Romney threw a bigger sink at me,' &quot; Phillips said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phillips and other strategists acknowledge that ads don't work the same way in a general election. By the summer and fall of an election year, the major candidates are usually well known, and TV advertising is just one way people form perceptions about them. There are many other sources of information: constant news coverage, campaign rallies, phone calls and home visits by campaign workers, as well as input from friends, family and co-workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign media advisers say that waging a modern presidential ad campaign is like swinging a giant hammer at a penny nail. Almost all of the commercials are aimed at a minority of a minority of voters: the few who haven't yet made up their minds in a handful of battleground states. A Gallup poll of likely voters in 12 such swing states in early May found that only 7 percent described themselves as undecided. And the number shrinks the closer it gets to Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TV ads affect &quot;a narrow sliver of voters in a very narrow segment of the country,&quot; says Steve McMahon, who directed former Vermont governor Howard Dean's primary advertising in 2004 and the Democratic National Committee's general-election ads in 2008. &quot;Those people receive information in lots of ways, and ads are just one way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McMahon says advertising is a key part of a candidate's communications strategy. &quot;All those [messages] create an orchestra. If your campaign is working, all the pieces come together,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMahon says the great danger for any campaign is to lose your &quot;share of voice&quot; - the ability to match or exceed an opponent's advertising. Such imbalances could crop up more frequently in this election because of unlimited spending by super PACs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the bulk of 30-second ads will be directed to a limited number of cities, broadcast stations and programs, the candidates have better ways than ever to target different sets of voters. Local cable stations make it possible to reach narrow subsets of voters, such as Latinos watching Telemundo in Tampa or African Americans watching BET in northern Ohio. Although the Internet is a growing source of targeted campaign advertising, it remains a distant second to traditional broadcasting, said Wesleyan Media Project's Fowler. In part, this is because TV ads are passive, whereas Internet ads require a viewer to click and play - a potential barrier, she notes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet there's little evidence that a memorable TV ad or series of ads can on their own change the dynamic of a presidential race. One of the most famous - Lyndon Johnson's &quot;Daisy&quot; commercial in 1964, in which Johnson implied that his Republican opponent, Sen. Barry Goldwater, would put the world at risk of nuclear war - didn't change Johnson's standing in the polls from the time the ad aired in early September until Election Day. Similarly, the four &quot;Swift Boat&quot; ads that attacked Kerry's war record and integrity in August 2004 had little prolonged impact. Kerry's poll numbers rose and fell before the ads began - and rose and fell right up until the election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, Fla. - Mitt Romney understands the power of the verbal gaffe, real or perceived. During the Republican primaries, he offered up an all-you-can-eat buffet of them: his wife's ''Cadillacs,'' his friends' Nascar teams, how he liked being able to fire people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every time, the Obama campaign and its Democratic allies were eager to pounce. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, having absorbed the painful lessons of the hyper-magnified (and context-removed) political blunder, Mr. Romney is turning the tables on President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the fifth day in a row, the Romney campaign assailed Mr. Obama on Tuesday over remarks that it said revealed his disconnect from economic reality, a theme that began on Friday after the president declared that the ''private sector is doing fine'' and shows no signs of letting up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech here in Orlando, Mr. Romney seized on a statement that the president made on Monday about the Affordable Care Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, a television reporter had asked the president about a small business in Iowa, whose owner claimed that the president's health care legislation had contributed to its closing in the state. Mr. Obama said that such an assertion of cause and effect was ''kind of hard to explain.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Because the only folks that have been impacted in terms of the health care bill are insurance companies who are required to make sure that they're providing preventive care, or they're not dropping your coverage when you get sick,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And so, this particular company probably wouldn't have been impacted by that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A gaffe? Mr. Romney treated it that way, and in his speech at a factory that makes air filters, he called the statement ''something else that shows just how much out of touch'' the president is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He said he didn't understand that Obamacare was hurting small business,'' Mr. Romney said. ''You have to scratch your head about that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney cited an online survey of almost 1,500 small-business owners, performed last July for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which found that three-quarters of them said they would be less likely to hire because of the burdens of the Affordable Care Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterword, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, Eric Fehrnstrom, said that Mr. Obama's comments about health care showed that ''this is a president who is detached from the effect his policies are having on the economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge of being out of touch is as old as politics itself. But it has become clear that the strategy will be deployed with growing regularity by the Romney campaign, allowing it to cast Mr. Obama as an entrenched Washington insider and sidestep potentially nettlesome issues like Mr. Romney's own experience with health care in Massachusetts. Not once during his speech on Tuesday did Mr. Romney discuss his government-sponsored overhaul of that state's health care system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Mr. Romney reiterated his plan to replace the Affordable Care Act with what he likened to a ''consumer market.'' That plan would allow those who buy insurance to receive the same tax advantages as businesses that purchase insurance for employees, ensure coverage for those with pre-existing conditions and hand control of health care to states, rather than the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Supreme Court likely to rule soon on the constitutionality of the health care law, Mr. Romney emphasized that his plan would be put into place regardless of the court's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign has a simple message these days, which it is repeating over and over: what it portrays as President Obama's ''mistakes'' are not mistakes at all. Instead, they are windows into the mind of a man detached from the problems of ordinary Americans and small businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a striking line of attack that seeks to repurpose and reverse the thrust of Mr. Obama's central critique of Mr. Romney: that he is a rapacious corporate raider unfamiliar with the problems of regular Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That message was at the core of the television commercials that the Obama campaign has run mocking Mr. Romney's tenure at Bain Capital, which feature laid-off workers. And at a fund-raiser in Owings Mills, Md., on Tuesday, Mr. Obama, who plans to give an address on the economy on Thursday, chided his opponent for his barrage of recent attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Because folks are still hurting right now, the other side feels that it's enough for them to just sit back and say things aren't as good as they should be, and it's Obama's fault,'' the president said. ''I mean, you can pretty much put their campaign on a tweet and have some characters to spare.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's campaign staff said it welcomed a debate over which candidate is more out of touch, especially given Mr. Romney's rhetorical record during the primary. But that is not deterring Mr. Romney. On Tuesday morning, he appeared on ''Fox and Friends,'' where he said the president was ''really out of touch with what is happening across America.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The president needs to go out and talk to people, not just do fund-raisers, go out and talk to people in the country and find out what is happening,'' Mr. Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That criticism appears to be seeping in. At the event here, Frank Attkisson, a small-business consultant and local commissioner, nodded in agreement with Mr. Romney during the speech, and afterword said the president's statements about the private sector and the health care law reveal ''his true colors.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The Republican Party's willingness to once again embrace George Allen as its Senate candidate for Virginia stands as a testament to short memories, a willingness to forgive and the potent desire to win. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political redemption, it seems, is almost never completely out of reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six years ago, after losing his Virginia Senate seat and handing control of the chamber to Democrats,  of his defeat would no longer loom so large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes winds - political or otherwise - can blow the leaves off branches and even break limbs,&quot; a reflective Mr. Allen said in November 2006. &quot;But a deep-rooted tree will stand, stay standing,&quot; and &quot;will regrow in the next season.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That next season began Tuesday, when Mr. Allen officially claimed the nomination of the Republican Party to regain his Senate seat. His former rival, James Webb, announced his retirement after just one term, and now Mr. Allen is one difficult election away from regaining what he lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He may or may not achieve that goal. He faces Tim Kaine, a popular ex-governor of the commonwealth, in a race that will draw huge resources from both parties. Mr. Allen's fortunes are tied to those of Mitt Romney in the state; political observers on both sides predict that if Mr. Romney, the Republican presidential hopeful, wins Virginia, so will Mr. Allen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But regardless of the outcome on Nov. 6, the Republican Party's willingness to once again embrace Mr. Allen stands as a testament to short memories, a willingness to forgive and the potent desire to win. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Allen was once a national star in the Republican Party with White House ambitions. But he became the political victim of a viral Internet video when, at a campaign stop, he called a young man of Indian descent a &quot;macaca,&quot; a term that can refer to monkeys. Mr. Webb's campaign eagerly pointed out the remark, and the furor over what Mr. Allen meant lasted for weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Allen and his team fumbled the response, alternately accusing the media of a witch hunt and apologizing for any offense. Longtime supporters stuck by him, but had long since given the maximum they could contribute for Mr. Allen's presidential hopes. His fund-raising dried up amid questions about ethnic insensitivities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the political history of Mr. Allen's 2006 loss is often attributed simply to that one phrase, it was much more than that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions about Mr. Allen's relationship to the black community were given new life by the controversy over his remarks. Stories about the Confederate flag he embraced in high school were written again. He once again had  in his law office - a Western lasso, he said, not a hateful symbol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more damaging were accusations - suddenly public - that Mr. Allen had used racial epithets against African-Americans while he was in college. At one point, Mr. Allen gathered a group of African-American ministers behind him for a news conference at which he angrily denied using the epithets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in the midst of it all was the odd revelation of Mr. Allen's Jewish heritage, the knowledge of which Mr. Allen discovered from his elderly mother after reporters pressed for more information about his background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about his Jewish ancestry at a debate, Mr. Allen angrily accused the reporter of &quot;making aspersions.&quot; But a few days later, his mother said she had finally revealed the truth she had been hiding from her children for decades: that she was brought up Jewish in North Africa after World War II and hid the fact when she moved back to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We sat across the table and he said, 'Mom, there's a rumor that Pop-pop and Mom-mom were Jewish and so were you,'&quot; Henrietta Allen recalled her son asking. Having received her answer, Mr. Allen issued a statement acknowledging and embracing his Jewish roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Allen's campaign against Mr. Webb hit back, running ads about an article titled &quot;Women Can't Fight,&quot; that Mr. Webb had written about his days at the Naval Academy. In one passage, Mr. Webb had recalled his dorms there as &quot;a horny woman's dream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was not enough for Mr. Allen, who lost that year by about 9,000 votes out of about 2.3 million cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For nearly five years after his loss, Mr. Allen disappeared from Virginia's political scene, nursing his wounds and, aides promised, planning his eventual return to public service. On Tuesday, Mr. Allen easily swept aside three Republican challengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Virginians are fired up, and they're ready for America's comeback,&quot; Mr. Allen told a small crowd near Richmond on Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing with him was Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, whose political career in Virginia has taken off nationally even as Mr. Allen's stalled. Standing with him was Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, whose political career in Virginia has taken off nationally even as Mr. Allen's stalled. Ken Cuccinelli, the state's Republican attorney general, endorsed Mr. Allen on Wednesday, saying his record &quot;towers above Tim Kaine's.&quot; Their support for Mr. Allen is an indication of how much the Republican establishment has moved past Mr. Allen's 2006 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the question is whether the voters of the state have moved on, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican primary on Tuesday was a low-turnout affair, a small and partisan slice of the state's voting population. Election Day in five months will be a broader test of the electorate's willingness to forgive and forget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Mr. Kaine's campaign has mostly stayed away from the controversies that dogged Mr. Allen's 2006 campaign, preferring to try and keep the focus on economic concerns that voters say are most important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But aides do not promise that Mr. Kaine will never bring them up. During an early debate last year in Richmond, Mr. Kaine chided Mr. Allen for the &quot;macaca&quot; moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was no mistake about what those words meant,&quot; Mr. Kaine said at the debate, which was hosted by The Associated Press. &quot;It's part of the divisive politics that we've got to put behind in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the race between Mr. Kaine and Mr. Allen is close toward the end - and most advisers to the candidates believe it will be - there could be pressure on Mr. Kaine to revive the controversies in television commercials. Such a move could tip the scale in Mr. Kaine's favor, or it could backfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Allen is the son of George Allen, the famed former coach of the Washington Redskins football team. The son favors cowboy boots and often tosses footballs with nearby staff members. On the day he conceded in 2006, he seemed eager to play ball again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Teammates, fellow patriots,&quot; he said, &quot;stay strong and stand strong for freedom!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Does the federal government have a duty to use its economic power in times of hardship to help states keep teachers on the job? <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I wrote yesterday on this blog, and as the board wrote on the editorial page today, President Obama and Mitt Romney differ on a very basic question: Does the federal government have a duty to use its economic power in times of deep economic hardship to help states and localities keep teachers, firefighters and policemen on the job?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama thinks it does. Mr. Romney thinks it does not. In fact, Mr. Romney summed up the divide rather well last week, when he said &quot;[The president] wants another stimulus, he wants to hire more government workers. He says we need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers. Did he not get the message of Wisconsin? The American people did. It's time for us to cut back on government and help the American people.&quot;<BR><BR>The Obama campaign is pressing this issue hard, as it should, with a new ad featuring a policeman, firefighter and a teacher pleading for their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Romney wants to cut taxes for people like himself by cutting jobs like mine,&quot; says Mike, the firefighter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jobs that support our families, strengthen our communities and grow our economy,&quot; says the police officer, De Mar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martha, an AP physics teacher, sums it up: &quot;You know what we really need less of? Romney economics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney is running against &quot;big government&quot; and uses as a prime example the stimulus plan that Mr. Obama managed to get through Congress in 2009. The stimulus was, indeed, a big government measure-big government at its best, doing what individuals and even states cannot do for themselves. Though not as large as it should have been, the stimulus still helped create jobs and stave off depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cutting back on government may assist the wealthiest Americans-who are no longer suffering from the recession, and don't need assistance-at least in the short term. &nbsp;But by Mr. Romney's own admission, cuts will hurt teachers, firefighters and police officers, and all the people who depend on them. That's what this election is about: Do we want politicians to help the 1% prosper, or help everyone else scratch their way back to something resembling stability?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it time for Democrats to panic? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what a growing number of party loyalists are wondering, amid a rough couple of weeks in which President Obama and his political operation have been buffeted by bad economic news, their own gaffes and signs that the presumed Republican nominee is gaining strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's team insists that it is unfazed by the recent bumps in the political road. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By November, &quot;it's going to be about: Who do I trust more in [his] approach to the debt? Who do I trust more to create middle-class jobs? Who do I trust more to create an energy future? Who do I trust more as it relates to Afghanistan?&quot; said David Plouffe, who served as Obama's campaign manager four years ago and is managing political strategy in the White House this time around.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what's going to decide the election, not the contretemps of the moment,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;We're very cognizant of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That kind of unflappability is a hallmark of the Obama political operation - and was a crucial ingredient in its success in 2008. But some Democratic veterans are wondering whether the reelection campaign, run by the same tight-knit group that led it four years ago, is equipped for what lies ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bad thing is, there is no new thinking in that circle,&quot; said one longtime operative in Democratic presidential campaigns who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight other prominent Democratic strategists interviewed shared that view, describing Obama's team as resistant to advice and assistance from those who are not part of its core. All of them spoke on the condition of anonymity as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest alarm came in a memo Monday from Democracy Corps, a research group headed by Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg and political consultant James Carville.          Based on their analysis of focus groups conducted late last month among swing voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania, they wrote that the current campaign message - which stresses the fragile progress of the economic recovery - is out of touch with the daily pain voters are feeling.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will face an impossible head wind in November if we do not move to a new narrative, one that contextualizes the recovery, but, more importantly, focuses on what we will do to make a better future for the middle class,&quot; Greenberg, Carville and pollster Erica Seifert wrote. They added: &quot;They know we are in a new normal where life is a struggle - and convincing them that things are good enough for those who have found jobs is a fool's errand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The memo came days after Obama handed the Republicans new ammunition with his declaration at a news conference that &quot;the private sector is doing fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However difficult the task, the president may have little choice but to try to make voters feel better about the economy. Successful presidents have run for reelection on the strength of their records, as well as on the hope they offered for the future. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But successful presidents also have benefited from presenting voters a choice - between their stewardship and their rivals'. Obama's defenders said that although the Greenberg data reflect voters' frustrations with the economy, they are not a good gauge of Obama's vision vs. that of GOP challenger Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's message &quot;has been spot-on in terms of where we are and where we're going,&quot; said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest economic news, including a report that the economy added only 69,000 jobs in May, made that challenge more difficult for Obama and his top strategists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama will deliver a major campaign speech Thursday in Cleveland in which he will try to frame the election as a choice between two economic visions - one that protects the middle class and another that takes the country back to the failed policies of the past, campaign officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now all the stories are about the flawed Obama team and strategy, which is ridiculous,&quot; said Mark McKinnon, who was a top campaign strategist for George W. Bush. &quot;They are not any more or less smart than they were four years ago. The dynamics are just different. This time, the wind is in their face instead of at their back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, some Democrats say that the campaign has lost its bearings at some turns recently. Some have suggested that the president's team is flailing in its attacks against Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When his campaign ran an ad criticizing the Republican's methods as a corporate turnaround artist - with one laid-off worker describing him as &quot;a vampire&quot; - Newark Mayor Cory Booker described it as &quot;nauseating&quot; and former Pennsylvania governor Edward G. Rendell called it &quot;disappointing.&quot;And when the campaign pivoted to an attack on Romney's record as Massachusetts governor, Obama strategist David Axelrod held a news conference in Boston, only to be drowned out by pro-Romney supporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plouffe dismissed the suggestion that the Obama operation has become too caught up in daily skirmishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, Plouffe said, is &quot;out there every day misrepresenting what the president has done on the economy, on spending, on foreign policy. Those things should not stand. But it's also important for people to understand this isn't simply a question of a referendum on the president. It's a choice between two visions and two records.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Running for reelection poses additional challenges for the political team that so successfully positioned Obama as an outsider and an agent of change in 2008. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one thing, the candidate now has a day job and therefore cannot devote five or six days a week to the campaign trail as he did then. Indeed, Obama was slower off the mark even than his predecessors Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Where Bush held his first big reelection campaign rally in March 2004, Obama's did not step out for his until last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And where Obama was the one who had superior financial resources in 2008, this year he is virtually certain to be outgunned by the combined forces of the Romney campaign and its allied super PACs. In May, Romney and the Republican National Committee raised nearly $77 million, while Obama and the Democratic National Committee brought in $60 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is still the power of the presidency. But the bully pulpit is not what it once was, given that this is an era in which people get information from far more sources than they did in the past. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's advisers say his campaign has advantages that will be critical if the race remains close. While the Republicans were slugging it out in a long and bitter primary, the Obama campaign was building its ground operation in key states - to a degree that Democrats think Romney won't be able to match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are laser-focused on the key 13 states, and within those key battleground states, there is a world of work being done,&quot; said Durbin, who added that he has had three extensive briefings on Obama's grass-roots operation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even compared with the impressive ground campaign of 2008, &quot;they know more about the swing voters and how to reach them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the lessons of this presidential election season, perhaps most salient is that the so-called Ordinary American is dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, should I say, the ordinary-American trope as political currency is bankrupt. We're all ordinary Americans except, perhaps, for the benighted 1 percent. Might we drop the pretense?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the record, this may be the first (and last) column in which I am permitted use of the term ordinary American. This is because my editors at The Washington Post Writers Group oppose its use (and I agree), suggestive as it is of some higher plane from which we in the nation's capital view non-Washingtonians. It is more than mere suggestion, of course. It is rather a prevailing attitude, perhaps attributable to Washington's relatively robust economy (government jobs skew the numbers), that folks out yonder have different concerns - somehow more ordinary - than the rest of us. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My first inkling of this communal detachment from the lives of most Americans occurred several years ago, when I had recently arrived and joined a panel of journalists to discuss, of all things, ourselves! The first question to me was: &quot;Kathleen, do you think the media are too elitist for ordinary Americans?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If memory serves, my immediate response was an unladylike guffaw, followed by the observation that the answer was implicit in the question. Having lived most of my life outside the Beltway, standing in grocery and gas lines with those everyday Americans who remain so mysterious to the Washington tribe, I have often felt like Margaret Mead, summoned to television green rooms to explain the behaviors of the indigenous peoples. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Might we admit that we are all more ordinary than the people we elect to represent us - and that thus it should be? The notion that one presidential candidate relates more than another to the ordinary American's everyday concerns is cringingly absurd. There's nothing &quot;everyday&quot; about either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney and why, really, would we want them to be? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not sure we even know what we mean by ordinary anymore. In the best sense, we mean people who go to work every day, marry and raise families, pay their bills and taxes, serve their communities and country and respect the difference between God and Caesar. Given the gradual degradation of these institutional concepts, both voluntary and owing to external pressures, one wonders what's ordinary about them. As a political concept, the Ordinary American has become something of a cartoon character - an undereducated, overweight bloke who holds smarty-pants elites in contempt. And, you can be sure, vice versa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinary Americans and those who court them have become unwilling participants in a cynical charade. Forcing our aspiring leaders to pretend to be ordinary, rolling up their sleeves and slugging back a (fill in the blank) at the local pub/coffee shop (but never a Starbucks), chumming with people they've studiously avoided all their lives, is the most ludicrous of exercises and rewards the very pandering we loathe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In possibly the most embarrassing political ad thus far, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour made a pitch to ordinary Americans to ante up $3 for a &quot;New York Night&quot; with the president and first lady, actress Sarah Jessica Parker and various others who will have paid thousands for the privilege of breaking bread together. It must be seen (http://ow.ly/bx5ZL).          Neither Obama nor Romney is remotely ordinary, needless to say. And neither is very good at faking it. Both bring substantial talents, a sterling career in Romney's case and a smorgasbord of broadening experiences in Obama's, including almost four years as president.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no point in trying to portray Romney as an everyday kind of guy. From his lucky birth to his significant accomplishments, he is anything but ordinary. Trying to blunt his rsum to make him more &quot;likable&quot; - perish that trivial pursuit while we're at it  - ultimately enhances the likelihood of the opposite result.          But neither can Obama make the case that Romney is out of touch after the Wintour ad. Or in the context of his own recent remarks that &quot;the private sector is doing fine,&quot; despite 23 million Americans out of work or underemployed.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retiring both the term and the idea of &quot;ordinary&quot; (and attendant perfidies) would be a welcome development in any random year, but especially in this one. Who, after all, wants to be ordinary - or be deemed so by the more fortunate? The ordinary American is us. Extraordinary leadership is what we hope for. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, some Democrats say that the campaign has lost its bearings at some turns recently. Some have suggested that the president's team is flailing in its attacks against Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When his campaign ran an adcriticizing the Republican's methods as a corporate turnaround artist - with one laid-off worker describing him as &quot;a vampire&quot; - Newark Mayor Cory Booker described it as &quot;nauseating&quot; and former Pennsylvania governor Edward G. Rendell called it &quot;disappointing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when the campaign pivoted to an attack on Romney's record as Massachusetts governor, Obama strategist David Axelrod held a news conference in Boston, only to be drowned out by pro-Romney supporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plouffe dismissed the suggestion that the Obama operation has become too caught up in daily skirmishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, Plouffe said, is &quot;out there every day misrepresenting what the president has done on the economy, on spending, on foreign policy. Those things should not stand. But it's also important for people to understand this isn't simply a question of a referendum on the president. It's a choice between two visions and two records.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Running for reelection poses additional challenges for the political team that so successfully positioned Obama as an outsider and an agent of change in 2008. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one thing, the candidate now has a day job and therefore cannot devote five or six days a week to the campaign trail as he did then. Indeed, Obama was slower off the mark even than his predecessors Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Where Bush held his first big reelection campaign rally in March 2004, Obama's did not step out for his until last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And where Obama was the one who had superior financial resources in 2008, this year he is virtually certain to be outgunned by the combined forces of the Romney campaign and its allied super PACs. In May, Romney and the Republican National Committee raised nearly $77 million, while Obama and the Democratic National Committee brought in $60 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is still the power of the presidency. But the bully pulpit is not what it once was, given that this is an era in which people get information from far more sources than they did in the past. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's advisers say his campaign has advantages that will be critical if the race remains close. While the Republicans were slugging it out in a long and bitter primary, the Obama campaign was building its ground operation in key states - to a degree that Democrats think Romney won't be able to match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are laser-focused on the key 13 states, and within those key battleground states, there is a world of work being done,&quot; said Durbin, who added that he has had three extensive briefings on Obama's grass-roots operation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even compared with the impressive ground campaign of 2008, &quot;they know more about the swing voters and how to reach them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the lessons of this presidential election season, perhaps most salient is that the so-called Ordinary American is dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, should I say, the ordinary-American trope as political currency is bankrupt. We're all ordinary Americans except, perhaps, for the benighted 1 percent. Might we drop the pretense?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the record, this may be the first (and last) column in which I am permitted use of the term ordinary American. This is because my editors at The Washington Post Writers Group oppose its use (and I agree), suggestive as it is of some higher plane from which we in the nation's capital view non-Washingtonians. It is more than mere suggestion, of course. It is rather a prevailing attitude, perhaps attributable to Washington's relatively robust economy (government jobs skew the numbers), that folks out yonder have different concerns - somehow more ordinary - than the rest of us. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My first inkling of this communal detachment from the lives of most Americans occurred several years ago, when I had recently arrived and joined a panel of journalists to discuss, of all things, ourselves! The first question to me was: &quot;Kathleen, do you think the media are too elitist for ordinary Americans?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If memory serves, my immediate response was an unladylike guffaw, followed by the observation that the answer was implicit in the question. Having lived most of my life outside the Beltway, standing in grocery and gas lines with those everyday Americans who remain so mysterious to the Washington tribe, I have often felt like Margaret Mead, summoned to television green rooms to explain the behaviors of the indigenous peoples. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Might we admit that we are all more ordinary than the people we elect to represent us - and that thus it should be? The notion that one presidential candidate relates more than another to the ordinary American's everyday concerns is cringingly absurd. There's nothing &quot;everyday&quot; about either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney and why, really, would we want them to be? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not sure we even know what we mean by ordinary anymore. In the best sense, we mean people who go to work every day, marry and raise families, pay their bills and taxes, serve their communities and country and respect the difference between God and Caesar. Given the gradual degradation of these institutional concepts, both voluntary and owing to external pressures, one wonders what's ordinary about them. As a political concept, the Ordinary American has become something of a cartoon character - an undereducated, overweight bloke who holds smarty-pants elites in contempt. And, you can be sure, vice versa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinary Americans and those who court them have become unwilling participants in a cynical charade. Forcing our aspiring leaders to pretend to be ordinary, rolling up their sleeves and slugging back a (fill in the blank) at the local pub/coffee shop (but never a Starbucks), chumming with people they've studiously avoided all their lives, is the most ludicrous of exercises and rewards the very pandering we loathe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In possibly the most embarrassing political ad thus far, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour made a pitch to ordinary Americans to ante up $3 for a &quot;New York Night&quot; with the president and first lady, actress Sarah Jessica Parker and various others who will have paid thousands for the privilege of breaking bread together. It must be seen (http://ow.ly/bx5ZL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Obama nor Romney is remotely ordinary, needless to say. And neither is very good at faking it. Both bring substantial talents, a sterling career in Romney's case and a smorgasbord of broadening experiences in Obama's, including almost four years as president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no point in trying to portray Romney as an everyday kind of guy. From his lucky birth to his significant accomplishments, he is anything but ordinary. Trying to blunt his rsum to make him more &quot;likable&quot; - perish that trivial pursuit while we're at it  - ultimately enhances the likelihood of the opposite result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neither can Obama make the case that Romney is out of touch after the Wintour ad. Or in the context of his own recent remarks that &quot;the private sector is doing fine,&quot; despite 23 million Americans out of work or underemployed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retiring both the term and the idea of &quot;ordinary&quot; (and attendant perfidies) would be a welcome development in any random year, but especially in this one. Who, after all, wants to be ordinary - or be deemed so by the more fortunate? The ordinary American is us. Extraordinary leadership is what we hope for. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DETROIT -- Lauded during a visit by President Obama, A123 Systems was supposed to be a centerpiece of his administration's effort to use $2 billion in government subsidies to jump-start production of sophisticated electric batteries in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the company, which makes lithium-ion batteries for electric cars, has stumbled along with the rest of the nascent industry and now threatens to give more ammunition to critics of the president's heavy spending on new energy technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A123 had to cut workers at its new factory in Livonia, Mich., financed in part with the promise of a $249 million government grant, after its battery for one new electric vehicle faltered and required an expensive recall. Completion of the factory has been delayed. The company is running short of money and has warned that unless it raises more cash from private investors, it might not be able to stay in business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet as much as A123 represents the risks of the government's battery technology program, it also represents its promise. On Tuesday, A123 Systems will unveil a new battery technology that the company says is a breakthrough in the industry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advance uses a new chemistry that could permit the creation of a simpler, lighter, longer-lasting battery pack that does not require a system to cool or heat it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The success or failure of the new technology may well determine the fate of A123. It will also render an early verdict on Mr. Obama's broader push to promote electric cars and build a domestic industry to develop and manufacture advanced batteries to run them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's prediction of a million electric cars on the road by 2015 seems unattainable, given the tepid demand for the first models on the market. So far this year, combined sales of the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid and Nissan Leaf electric car total less than 10,000 vehicles. The slow sales have already become a campaign issue, and the failure of the solar-panel company Solyndra has also drawn intense criticism of the administration's clean-energy subsidies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the Solyndra bankruptcy, which cost taxpayers about half a billion dollars, the Department of Energy has tightened controls on loans related to electric cars and other fuel-saving technology. In the case of Fisker Automotive, which received the defective A123 batteries, the government froze its loans when the company missed production schedules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executives of A123, which is based in Waltham, Mass., say the company has gotten off to a slower start than anticipated because the market for electric cars has failed to grow. The company reported a loss of $125 million in the first quarter of this year, as revenues dropped 40 percent from the year earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's been softer than what we and everyone else expected,'' said David Vieau, chief executive of A123.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the major automakers remain committed to electric vehicles so far, and G.M. has given A123 the contract to supply batteries for the Chevrolet Spark, an all-electric minicar due next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government, for its part, recently gave A123 an extra two years to meet production targets at its Michigan factory and earn the full $249 million grant, which is being disbursed in tranches. So far, only about half the money has been given to the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the factory grant, A123 has received about $14 million in Energy Department money for research and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government may have financed the company because ''these guys have some new chemistry, some new ideas,'' rather than the ability to commercialize the product, said Professor Prashant N. Kumta, a materials science expert at the University of Pittsburgh, who began working on lithium-ion batteries in the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that A123 had been ''a bit of a disappointment'' because it had not put much product into the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Energy Department said it would not comment on the viability of individual companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a spokeswoman, Jen Stutsman, said, ''The market for electrified vehicles is expected to triple by 2017 -- which is why automakers in every part of the world are racing to introduce new models of hybrid and electric vehicles.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The investments being made today will help ensure that the jobs that support this rapidly growing industry are created here in the United States,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of the energy programs say it is unrealistic to expect every government-backed company to thrive immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We should be willing to take on some of the risks for the new energy economy, even if some of these start-ups fail,'' said Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that investigated Solyndra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mitt Romney, the presumed Republican nominee for president and former governor of Massachusetts, has attacked subsidies to energy companies as a waste of taxpayer dollars. ''When Mitt Romney is president, government will stop meddling in the marketplace,'' a Romney spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, said on the campaign's Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A123 Systems is a prime example of how a promising venture can bog down in the harsh realities of the automotive marketplace. Founded in 2001, the company has been primarily focused on making lithium-ion battery packs specifically for cars, like the Fisker Karma and a forthcoming all-electric version of the Chevrolet Spark, a minicar made by General Motors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the company stumbled when it was forced to recall potentially defective batteries planned for use in the Fisker vehicle. And with the future market for electric cars in question, A123 might not survive solely on batteries for those models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, A123 is now hoping that the new technology it is unveiling Tuesday, called Nanophosphate EXT, will help it enter new markets. The company says the new electrolyte chemistry eliminates the need for heating and cooling in extreme temperatures. That would avoid the addition of costly and heavy temperature-management equipment and prolong the life of the battery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technology could be used to produce batteries for telecommunications equipment, military vehicles and hybrid gas-electric cars that employ start-and-stop engine systems. It also could yield batteries that could be used to replace the millions of ordinary lead-acid batteries in cars currently on the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's a hedge against the market for electric vehicles,'' Mr. Vieau said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company is hoping that the promise of the new technology will help persuade investors to back a $50 million convertible debt offering by the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One battery expert said the new technology's extended life span could have an immediate impact on the luxury-car market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The car company can advertise that this lithium-ion battery is going to last the life of the vehicle, with no need for replacement,'' said Ahmad A. Pesaran, an engineer at the government's National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potential automotive customers can test samples later this year, with production scheduled to begin in the first half of 2013.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;For the fifth day in a row, the Romney campaign assailed President Obama for remarks that he said revealed the president's disconnect from economic reality. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, Fla. - Mitt Romney understands the power of the verbal gaffe, real or perceived. During the Republican primaries, he offered up an all-you-can-eat buffet of them: his wife's &quot;Cadillacs,&quot; his friends' Nascar teams, how he liked being able to fire people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every time, the Obama campaign and its Democratic allies were eager to pounce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, having absorbed the painful lessons of the hyper-magnified (and context-removed) political blunder, Mr. Romney is turning the tables on President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the fifth day in a row, the Romney campaign assailed Mr. Obama on Tuesday over remarks that it said revealed his disconnect from economic reality, a theme that began on Friday after the president declared that the &quot;private sector is doing fine&quot; and shows no signs of letting up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech here in Orlando, Mr. Romney seized on a statement that the president made on Monday about the Affordable Care Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, a television reporter had asked the president about a small business in Iowa, whose owner claimed that the president's health care legislation had contributed to its closing in the state. Mr. Obama said that such an assertion of cause and effect was &quot;kind of hard to explain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because the only folks that have been impacted in terms of the health care bill are insurance companies who are required to make sure that they're providing preventive care, or they're not dropping your coverage when you get sick,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;And so, this particular company probably wouldn't have been impacted by that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A gaffe? Mr. Romney treated it that way, and in his speech at a factory that makes air filters, he called the statement &quot;something else that shows just how much out of touch&quot; the president is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said he didn't understand that Obamacare was hurting small business,&quot; Mr. Romney said. &quot;You have to scratch your head about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney cited an online survey of almost 1,500 small-business owners, performed last July for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which found that three-quarters of them said they would be less likely to hire because of the burdens of the Affordable Care Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterword, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, Eric Fehrnstrom, said that Mr. Obama's comments about health care showed that &quot;this is a president who is detached from the effect his policies are having on the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge of being out of touch is as old as politics itself. But it has become clear that the strategy will be deployed with growing regularity by the Romney campaign, allowing it to cast Mr. Obama as an entrenched Washington insider and sidestep potentially nettlesome issues like Mr. Romney's own experience with health care in Massachusetts. Not once during his speech on Tuesday did Mr. Romney discuss his government-sponsored overhaul of that state's health care system. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Mr. Romney reiterated his plan to replace the Affordable Care Act with what he likened to a &quot;consumer market.&quot; That plan would allow those who buy insurance to receive the same tax advantages as businesses that purchase insurance for employees, ensure coverage for those with pre-existing conditions and hand control of health care to states, rather than the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Supreme Court likely to rule soon on the constitutionality of the health care law, Mr. Romney emphasized that his plan would be put into place regardless of the court's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign has a simple message these days, which it is repeating over and over: what it portrays as President Obama's &quot;mistakes&quot; are not mistakes at all. Instead, they are windows into the mind of a man detached from the problems of ordinary Americans and small businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a striking line of attack that seeks to repurpose and reverse the thrust of Mr. Obama's central critique of Mr. Romney: that he is a rapacious corporate raider unfamiliar with the problems of regular Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That message was at the core of the television commercials that the Obama campaign has run mocking Mr. Romney's tenure at Bain Capital, which feature laid-off workers. And at a fund-raiser in Owings Mills, Md., on Tuesday, Mr. Obama, who plans to give an address on the economy on Thursday, chided his opponent for his barrage of recent attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because folks are still hurting right now, the other side feels that it's enough for them to just sit back and say things aren't as good as they should be, and it's Obama's fault,&quot; the president said. &quot;I mean, you can pretty much put their campaign on a tweet and have some characters to spare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's campaign staff said it welcomed a debate over which candidate is more out of touch, especially given Mr. Romney's rhetorical record during the primary. But that is not deterring Mr. Romney. On Tuesday morning, he appeared on &quot;Fox and Friends,&quot; where he said the president was &quot;really out of touch with what is happening across America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president needs to go out and talk to people, not just do fund-raisers, go out and talk to people in the country and find out what is happening,&quot; Mr. Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That criticism appears to be seeping in. At the event here, Frank Attkisson, a small-business consultant and local commissioner, nodded in agreement with Mr. Romney during the speech, and afterword said the president's statements about the private sector and the health care law reveal &quot;his true colors.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Internet-savvy members of the political left have found the root of their problem -- the ''super PACs'' unleashed by the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling. They just do not know how to solve it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's Netroots Nation conference fell just days after Tuesday's failed effort to recall a union-busting Republican governor in Wisconsin. The liberal activists and bloggers who gathered here for the four-day event were clearly upset that their highly refined ground game could not overcome the huge financial advantage held by the governor, Scott Walker, and his forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Walker's victory was attributable only in part to the Supreme Court case that paved the way for unlimited donations to outside political groups. Still, the conference attendees feared that especially in races further down the ballot, super PACs would hit their candidates with a barrage of attack ads that they could not match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The reality is we're not going to change the system overnight,'' said Daniel Mintz, campaign director at MoveOn.org. ''This is a new world, and if we don't figure it out, we're going to have a lot more losses than wins.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others suggested that voters would get weary and cynical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In the long run, people are going to stop believing the ads,'' said Alan Grayson, a former congressman from Florida who lost his seat in 2010 but is running again in a more favorably drawn district. ''Everybody's campaign is going to be different because of the effect of Citizens United.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Success, Interrupted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By some measures, the left has had a successful year. There was Occupy Wall Street and the defeat of anti-union legislation in Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social media campaigns restored financing to Planned Parenthood from the Susan G. Komen Foundation and eliminated much corporate money going to the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative organization behind policies like the Stand Your Ground law at the center of the Trayvon Martin case in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An apparently improving economy combined with a hard-fought Republican primary race to ease worries about President Obama's re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But things have changed in the last few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I fear Mitt Romney, I fear a Republican Senate, and I fear a Republican House,'' said Paul Baker, 62, who co-founded a company based in Chicago that makes apps to promote government transparency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year's conference was marked by the left's frustration with the president. But this year, his name simply did not come up much -- and when it did, it was invariably paired with a favorable comparison to Mr. Romney. As Van Jones, a former Obama administration official, said, they are ''no longer comparing Obama to the Almighty and instead are comparing him to the alternative.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president addressed the conference via a video emphasizing promises he has kept and featuring a family that relies on the health care overhaul to pay for their son's hemophilia medication. But his campaign did not send a senior aide or a surrogate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama-Biden booth in the exhibition hall attracted a steady stream of people signing up to volunteer or discuss blogging about the election, and his digital outreach team hosted nuts-and-bolts sessions about online training and using Microsoft Excel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Left's New Star</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elizabeth Warren, on the other hand, received standing ovations both before and after her speech on Friday. Though she is running for Senate in Massachusetts, Ms. Warren, a consumer watchdog and Harvard law professor, has become a national star of the left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Republican nominee said corporations are people,'' Ms. Warren said. ''No, Mitt, corporations are not people. People have hearts, they have kids, they get jobs, they get sick, they love, cry, they dance, they live and they die. Learn the difference.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just hours later, at a party hosted by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., attendees were bemoaning the influence of big money in politics but were at a loss on what to do about it, barring changing campaign finance laws. Many were resigned to ceding the ad war to the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategists are considering ways to ''inoculate'' candidates against negative advertising through an improved ground game and an emphasis on using social media for personal interaction and persuasion, rather than blasting messages indiscriminately. Some expressed a heightened sense of urgency behind frequently discussed aspirations of financing a liberal message machine, including bloggers and radio stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Donors are getting increasingly frustrated with funding TV ads, which might win an election but don't create lasting value,'' said Kari Chisholm, an Internet campaign strategist from Portland, Ore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Netroots Nation is perhaps the most prominent gathering of left-wing critics of the Democratic establishment, they were nonetheless reminded of the left's fractious nature. Across the street, Occupy Wall Street protesters camped out, calling for taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent and drawing attention to a state bailout of 38 Studios, the video game company of the retired baseball star Curt Schilling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama supporters court Hispanics by using Mitt Romney's words against him. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priorities USA Action, a &quot;super PAC&quot; backing President Obama, is starting a $4 million ad campaign aimed at Hispanic voters in three swing states, thegroup plans to announce Monday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads - to run in Colorado, Florida and Nevada throughout the summer - accuse Mr. Romney of not worrying about Hispanic families who are unemployed and workers who don't have much money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads are being produced in cooperation with the Service Employees International Union and use Mr. Romney's own words as evidence of what the groups call his &quot;devastating policies&quot; for Hispanic families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can focus on the very poor, that's not my focus,&quot; Mr. Romney says in the ad. The comment is part of an interview Mr. Romney gave during the primary campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Hispanic workers react to his comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Spanish, one says: &quot;What about us? He's not thinking about us.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another says: &quot;It's easy for him to say that since he doesn't have the same necessities as us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a third says &quot;He is just thinking about those that have made money already.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priorities USA Action and S.E.I.U. have focused on three states both campaigns have said they are eager to win. And all three states have growing Hispanic populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As The Times reported on Sunday, Hispanic voters are more likely than other minorities to stay home on Election Day, prompting concern among Democrats that their influence on the campaign will be muted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials with S.E.I.U said the ads are an attempt to change that dynamic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This ad is part of a broader effort to ensure Latino voters know the stakes in this election and who has been on the side of Latino Families and who will continue to stand with them in the coming years,&quot; said  Brandon Davis, the group's national political director.</SPAN></P>

During campaign stops and speeches throughout the week, each floated their own proposals to stimulate the economy. President Obama urged Congress to pass legislation that he said would put construction workers, teachers, police officers and firefighters back to work.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney has a rather straight-forward message for small-business owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love you guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican presidential challenger earlier last week mapped out his plans to improve the outlook for the nation's smallest companies, promising to lower taxes, block health care reform and weed out cumbersome federal regulations if elected president. Moreover, Romney vowed to remain &quot;all ears&quot; to the ever-changing needs of business owners and actively seek their advice on how to strengthen the economy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What makes America's economy go is individuals with dreams who take risks, borrow money from their family, max out their credit cards, maybe get an outside investor,&quot; he said during a teleconference hosted by the National Federation of Independent Business on Wednesday. &quot;People starting businesses and taking those risks create the jobs that put America to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Romney said those risks have become far too great because of what he described as the &quot;anti-business, anti-investment and anti-job&quot; policies of the Obama  administration. He took particular exception with the president's stimulus package, energy and trade policies and health care reform initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obamacare has frightened more businesses from hiring people than any piece of legislation I can recall,&quot; he said, speaking via phone from San Antonio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should he win in November, Romney said he would begin by issuing an executive order freezing all regulations approved under but not yet implemented by President Obama. His administration would then review each one individually, taking &quot;a weed whacker&quot; to the ones they deem detrimental to business. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor also said he would block the president's health care reform measures by issuing a waiver to all states allowing them to sidestep the mandate. He would also try to reduce the top individual tax rate from 35 percent to 28 percent by eliminating many exemptions and deductions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has touted his own small-business agenda in recent weeks, urging Congress to approve legislation giving a 10 percent income tax credit to companies that create new jobs or increase wages this year. He has also asked lawmakers to extend a provision allowing firms to deduct the value of their business investments through 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What that does is give them an incentive as they're expanding to say, 'Maybe we hire an extra two people, maybe we hire an extra three people,'&quot; Obama said at a roundtable discussion last month in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president has also hammered Romney's business background, arguing that he profited off of the failures or other working Americans and raked in millions without hiring any workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president's spokesman said, 'Mitt Romney was in business, but he was trying to earn a profit, not just trying to hire people,'&quot; Romney said. &quot;Well, I have to tell you, that's sort of what business is about. The free enterprise system is about people taking a risk to earn a return to earn a profit, and if they do, they are able to hire more people. Profits and people go together when you're talking about creating new jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney has a rather straight-forward message for small-business owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love you guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican presidential challenger earlier last week mapped out his plans to improve the outlook for the nation's smallest companies, promising to lower taxes, block health care reform and weed out cumbersome federal regulations if elected president. Moreover, Romney vowed to remain &quot;all ears&quot; to the ever-changing needs of business owners and actively seek their advice on how to strengthen the economy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What makes America's economy go is individuals with dreams who take risks, borrow money from their family, max out their credit cards, maybe get an outside investor,&quot; he said during a teleconference hosted by the National Federation of Independent Business on Wednesday. &quot;People starting businesses and taking those risks create the jobs that put America to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Romney said those risks have become far too great because of what he described as the &quot;anti-business, anti-investment and anti-job&quot; policies of the Obama  administration. He took particular exception with the president's stimulus package, energy and trade policies and health care reform initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obamacare has frightened more businesses from hiring people than any piece of legislation I can recall,&quot; he said, speaking via phone from San Antonio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should he win in November, Romney said he would begin by issuing an executive order freezing all regulations approved under but not yet implemented by President Obama. His administration would then review each one individually, taking &quot;a weed whacker&quot; to the ones they deem detrimental to business. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor also said he would block the president's health care reform measures by issuing a waiver to all states allowing them to sidestep the mandate. He would also try to reduce the top individual tax rate from 35 percent to 28 percent by eliminating many exemptions and deductions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has touted his own small-business agenda in recent weeks, urging Congress to approve legislation giving a 10 percent income tax credit to companies that create new jobs or increase wages this year. He has also asked lawmakers to extend a provision allowing firms to deduct the value of their business investments through 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What that does is give them an incentive as they're expanding to say, 'Maybe we hire an extra two people, maybe we hire an extra three people,'&quot; Obama said at a roundtable discussion last month in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president has also hammered Romney's business background, arguing that he profited off of the failures or other working Americans and raked in millions without hiring any workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president's spokesman said, 'Mitt Romney was in business, but he was trying to earn a profit, not just trying to hire people,'&quot; Romney said. &quot;Well, I have to tell you, that's sort of what business is about. The free enterprise system is about people taking a risk to earn a return to earn a profit, and if they do, they are able to hire more people. Profits and people go together when you're talking about creating new jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama's allies return to a previous theme in a new ad about Mitt Romney's ties to Bain. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priorities USA Action, the pro-Obama &quot;super PAC,&quot; is up with a new anti-Mitt Romney advertisement that takes aim at Bain Capital's stewardship of a steel mill whose closing led to the loss of hundreds of jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ad, a former worker, Donnie Box, stands outside the plant and says, &quot;Romney and Bain Capital shut this place down.&quot; He adds, &quot;They promised us health care packages, they promised to maintain our retirement program. And those are the first two things -- disappeared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is not the first to focus on Bain's takeover of the plant, which was operated by GST Steel in Kansas City, Mo. In May, the super PAC released a similar commercial featuring a different worker and the same news clips about the plant's closing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama and his allies have been criticized for their focus on Mr. Romney's leadership at Bain Capital, and over the last month the campaign has tried other avenues of attack, including going after Mr. Romney's jobs record when he was governor of Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response the the new ad, Andrea Saul of the Romney campaign released the following statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another day, another misleading attack from President Obama's allies. President Obama thinks the economy is 'doing fine,' in spite of the fact that 23 million Americans are struggling for work, incomes have fallen and America is drowning in debt. President Obama's own supporters - even former President Clinton - have criticized these distorted attacks on free enterprise, calling them 'nauseating' and 'unfair.' Unlike President Obama, Mitt Romney has the record and pro-growth plan to fix the economy and get our country back on the right track.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Mr. Romney, Bain acquired a majority stake in the company and its debt load grew. A Reuters report said Bain made $12 million off its initial $8 million investment in the company and at least $4.5 million in consulting fees, and that the federal government had to bail out its underfunded pension plan. By the time the plant closed in 2001, eliminating 750 jobs, Mr. Romney was no longer with Bain.</SPAN></P>

But it is also important for campaigns to clean things up after they have gotten a bit messy. <BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FUND-RAISING Last week, Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, tried to use the bad news about the money wars. &quot;We got beat!&quot; he wrote in an e-mail to supporters afterMitt Romney raised almost $17 million more than Mr. Obama in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that reverse psychology works, June could be a better month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most of the past year, liberals had assumed that Mr. Obama would outraise the Republican candidate, a blas&eacute; attitude that may no longer be common among Mr. Obama's most ardent supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama will start this week with another fund-raiser in New York City. The dinner withAnna Wintour, the editor of Vogue magazine, and the actressSarah Jessica Parker is sure to generate plenty of cash, as well as headlines good and bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COUNTERPUNCH It took only a few hours after the news conference on Friday for Mr. Obama's campaign to return to the offensive, and it is likely to continue attacking this week as the president travels to Maryland, Pennsylvania and Ohio to try to to regain momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Iowa on Friday, Mr. Romney mocked Mr. Obama's assertion that more federal money should be spent to help states pay for teachers, firefighters and police officers. Mr. Obama's campaign quickly pounced, accusing him of not supporting those professions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign surrogates took to Twitter, blogs, cable TV and newspapers, seeing an opportunity to raise questions about Mr. Romney. It was part of an effort to deflect attention from Mr. Obama's assertion at the news conference - later reversed - that the &quot;private economy is doing fine.&quot; That message continued on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said we don't need any more teachers,&quot;David Axelrod, the president's senior campaign adviser, said of Mr. Romney on CNN's &quot;State of the Union&quot; on Sunday. &quot;We don't need any more teachers?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continued, &quot;What planet is he living on where he thinks we can take these kinds of hits in our education system and move on as a country?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHANGE OF SUBJECT One of the best ways to recover from a bad week is to talk about something else, and for that, there is no better job in the world than to be president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Mr. Obama will present the Presidential Medal of Freedom toShimon Peres, the president of Israel, at a dinner at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, he will travel to New York City for a visit to ground zero. It is designed to coincide with a milestone in the construction of One World Trade Center, a &quot;topping off&quot; ceremony that will commemorate the completion of the framework. But it will also provide a way to shift coverage toward a different and safer conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE UNKNOWN Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign was particularly good at deftly reacting to events; his handling of the economy's collapse in September of that year may have cemented his election. There is no reason to think that his current campaign will not be just as effective in that area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What will the president have to confront in the coming week? Europe's leaders will be grappling with the debt crises in Greece, Italy and Spain. The investigation into national security leaks may pick up steam. The situation in Syria could turn even worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How the president handles those events - and others that might arise - could help redirect his campaign, for better or for worse.</SPAN></P>

Walker's victory amounted to a significant defeat for the nation's labor unions, which had mounted one of their most aggressive grass-roots campaigns ever to try to defeat the Republican. &para; As one of his first acts after taking office two years ago, Walker targeted the unions representing government workers, moving to curb their collective-bargaining rights. Also, his plan to address a state budget shortfall called on most public workers to pay more for health insurance and pension benefits. &para; But even after the groups allied against Walker spent $18 million, it was insufficient to match the governor, whose campaign and supporters spent $47 million. </SPAN></P>

Walker's victory amounted to a significant defeat for the nation's labor unions, which had mounted one of their most aggressive grass-roots campaigns ever to try to defeat the Republican. &Acirc;&para; As one of his first acts after taking office two years ago, Walker targeted the unions representing government workers, moving to curb their collective-bargaining rights. Also, his plan to address a state budget shortfall called on most public workers to pay more for health insurance and pension benefits. &Acirc;&para; But even after the groups allied against Walker spent $18 million, it was insufficient to match the governor, whose campaign and supporters spent $47 million. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Business</SPAN><BR></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wal-Mart's final shareholder vote for its board of directors showed unprecedented dissent against key executives and board members, including chief executive Mike Duke, in the wake of allegations of bribery in Mexico. Even so, all of the company's nominees were reelected. </SPAN></P>

Bernanke's appearance before Congress came after two weak jobs reports and a slew of other economic data showed that U.S. economic growth was slowing and the unemployment rate had started heading back up.</SPAN></P>

Obama put forward plans to give homebuyers a tax break and stimulate small businesses, saying that the ideas he advanced have received broad support from nonpartisan experts and that plans proposed by Republican lawmakers would &quot;add weakness&quot; to the economy. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Mitt Romney's campaign feeling the pressure from President Obama's attacks on his record as governor of Massachusetts?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new television ad by Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, responds directly to the attacks, claiming ''the best jobs record in a decade'' for Mr. Romney while he led the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Romney reduced unemployment to just 4.7 percent,'' the narrator in the ad says. ''He balanced every budget without raising taxes. He did it by bringing parties together to cut through gridlock. From Day 1 as president, Mitt Romney's strong leadership will make all the difference on jobs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear, however, how much money Mr. Romney's campaign was spending on the ad, or how many states it will be running in. A spokeswoman for the campaign refused to disclose any details of the size or scope of the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad follows a $10 million push in nine battleground states by Mr. Obama's campaign to attack the governor's record in Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad, titled ''Heard It Before,'' shows Mr. Romney saying that he speaks ''the language of business.'' But the ad cites newspaper articles that suggest that Mr. Romney presided over one of ''the worst economic records in the country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs,'' the narrator says. ''And fell to 47th in job creation. Fourth from the bottom.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision by Mr. Romney's Boston headquarters to respond directly to Mr. Obama's attacks suggests that the Republican team believes there is political danger in letting them go unanswered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's&nbsp;ad also continues the ''Day One'' theme that his campaign has been using in television commercials to try and show how a Republican administration would immediately be different from Mr. Obama's presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. Romney believe that people have soured on Mr. Obama but want to know how Mr. Romney would be better. The ads are an effort to answer that question in a way that his advisers believe will help Mr. Romney get elected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, is celebrating 25 years as a member of Congress on Saturday and the celebrations and commemorations of the milestone have been epic. There have been million-dollar fundraisers and lectures with former presidents; San Francisco streets have been named after her; and there were concerts with rock star Bono and the remaining members of the Grateful Dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is not lost on Pelosi - what a long, strange trip it's been. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've exploited it to the hilt,&quot; she joked with reporters recently, adding, &quot;We've got music, we've got streets, we've got bridges. Very immodest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pelosi celebration tour is the latest evidence that she remains an indomitable force in Democratic politics and unequaled in star power among House Democrats. At the same time, the moment has also served to highlight the lack of any obvious heirs apparent to the 72-year-old Pelosi, who is now in her 10th year leading the caucus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pelosi, the first female speaker in history, won't hear any talk of  leaving. She remains focused on what she calls the &quot;Drive for 25,&quot; the number of seats Democrats need to pick up in November for her to become the first person since the legendary Sam Rayburn, in 1955, to reclaim the speakership after losing it it. Part of the reason she chose to publicly exploit this anniversary is the coincidental convergence of the length of her tenure and the number of seats she needs to make history again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did I tell you it's my 25th anniversary? Did I tell you it's the same number, 'Drive for 25,' for control?&quot; she told reporters Thursday. Taking back the House is an obvious long shot for Democrats, and Pelosi is still recovering from the lingering effects of a $70 million ad campaign by national Republicans in 2010 that demonized her in races across the country, leading to a historic 63-seat loss by Democrats in the midterms. After the drubbing, most members of her own caucus expected Pelosi to resign. She did not, and faced token opposition in her run for minority leader.Internal rivals acknowledge, even now, that she is secure as head of her caucus and will become speaker if Democrats win the majority this November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If she wants to be, if she gets the breaks this fall, she will be speaker,&quot; said Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), the dean of the House and longest-serving congressman in history. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While she continues to be an unpopular figure among many Americans, Pelosi has receded somewhat from the spotlight that was so inescapable in 2010. This fall the Democrat who Republicans will most seek to undermine is President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a special election Tuesday to replace former representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), Republicans have used only a fleeting image of Pelosi and instead focus on linking Democratic candidate Ron Barber to the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if to underscore her reputation for tirelessness, Pelosi left Washington on Friday for a week-long excursion along the Interstate 95 corridor in the Northeast, planning more than a half-dozen stops at fundraisers for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her fundraising efforts are a key reason that in the first four months of 2012, the DCCC has outraised its Republican counterpart, $28.6 million to $26.1 million, an unheard of development for the minority in an election year in which no independent analysts are predicting a Democratic majority. &quot;She hasn't slowed down 1 mile per hour,&quot; said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), part of a tight clique of veterans that forms Pelosi's kitchen cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Democrats see the anniversary tour as a legacy-building effort by Pelosi. On Thursday, her colleagues delivered speeches on the House floor honoring her accomplishments, then about 120 Democrats crowded into a first-floor committee room for a second surprise party, complete with chocolate cupcakes with &quot;Pelosi 25&quot; written on each. Pelosi's California colleague, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, also came bearing a gift: a framed copy of Pelosi's first speech on the House floor, about fighting AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) recalled their days as congressional interns together, back when a male intern had more power and women answered phones. However, according to those present, Hoyer juxtaposed that with the current setting: &quot;Her sitting at the front desk, me in the back - things have never changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some believe that Pelosi will step down if Democrats do not reclaim the majority in November. If Obama gets reelected, the 2014 midterm elections would provide a historically bad opportunity for congressional Democrats, making the 2016 elections the next chance to claim the majority. If Mitt Romney wins, the 2014 midterms would pose a real chance for Democrats, but Pelosi will turn 75 in March 2015. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one seems to know what her next move will be. Her friends and her staff profess to have no idea how long she wants to do this job. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only she knows that,&quot; said Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.), a close friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some corners Hoyer - her onetime rival for the leader's post and now her understudy for a decade - is presumed to be next in line. But at 73, even Hoyer's allies in the caucus call him a &quot;transitional&quot; leader at best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waiting on the sidelines are a collection of 40- and 50-somethings: Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.), currently serving as Democratic National Committee chairman; Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the ranking member of the Budget Committee; Xavier Becerra (Calif.), the No. 5 ranking member of leadership; Steve Israel (N.Y.), chairman of the DCCC; and Joseph Crowley (N.Y.), a top DCCC fundraiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some are viewed as smart legislative tacticians but poor with fundraising skills; others have good political instincts but no legislative heft. Among rank-and-file lawmakers, views of the people in that group indicate that each is slightly better than average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None is Pelosi, they say.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The energy chapter of Mitt Romney's &quot;Believe in America&quot; economic plan is chock-full of statistics and job claims - numbers that will get a closer look after the recent dismal employment figures. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the controversial estimates in the plan is that new ozone regulations under President Obama would cost the U.S. economy 7.3 million jobs - more than all of the Americans who are now working for makers of apparel, automobiles, airplanes, machinery, paper, plastics and rubber, rail cars, beverages and cigarettes, and food and livestock products, as well as those working in mining or oil and gas extraction.           Some economists say the number is a stretch. And it may be moot, because Obama overruled the Environmental Protection Agency and shelved new ozone regulations in September, angering environmentalists.            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign says the &quot;Believe in America&quot; booklet went to press the day before Obama's action. Nonetheless, Romney's campaign Web site still asserts that the Obama administration &quot;has pursued numerous regulations that would drive up energy prices while destroying millions of jobs.&quot; It is just one in a slew of Romney attacks on Obama's energy policies. The Republican presidential candidate talks about building nuclear plants, opening up virtually every part of U.S. land and waters to oil and gas drilling, exploiting coal and stripping the EPA of much of its authority, especially when it comes to regulating greenhouse gases.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether any place would be off limits for oil drilling, campaign spokesman Andrea Saul said, &quot;Governor Romney will permit drilling wherever it can be done safely, taking into account local concerns.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Shifting positions          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy is a tricky issue this year. Romney's and Obama's positions have moved along with the nation's shifting energy landscape. Obama has grown more supportive of natural gas and oil drilling, striving to become an &quot;all of the above&quot; energy candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, Romney, who says he opposes federal aid for renewable energy, has portrayed the bankrupt solar panel maker Solyndra, a recipient of $535 million in federal loan guarantees, as a poster child of policy failure. After talking to reporters outside the shuttered Solyndra plant last week, Romney released a television ad featuring images of the plant and of Romney, who tells viewers that the now-bankrupt company's federal funding is an example of &quot;crony capitalism.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's view that the government should cut off aid to renewable energy marks a reversal for the candidate. On Jan. 22, 2003, after becoming Massachusetts governor, Romney stood in front of Konarka, a developer of thin-film solar panels, and handed out $9 million from a &quot;green energy fund&quot; to renewable energy firms. Two years later, he said that &quot;clean energy&quot; was &quot;an economic engine very much like biotech&quot; that could spur &quot;explosive growth&quot; in Massachusetts. Romney said he would make Massachusetts a more appealing place for such companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 1, however, the day after Romney stood in front of Solyndra, Konarka went bankrupt. Although Konarka had raised large amounts from private investors, ultimately it closed its manufacturing plant and laid off 85 people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether Romney's opposition to helping renewable energy firms meant that he was against the popular production tax credits for wind and solar, Saul said, &quot;Governor Romney believes the government should get out of the business of picking winners and losers, and let the free market drive innovation.&quot; Like Obama, Romney does favor aid for basic research into cleaner energy technology. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The job statistics underpinning key parts of Romney's energy plan - collected from media accounts, conservative think-tank reports and other sources - highlight the change that the former Massachusetts governor has undergone since his last presidential campaign, as well as his stint in public office. In each case, Romney has pointed to the most extreme projections of the results of Obama's policies to support his proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney &quot;Believe in America&quot; booklet uses estimates of jobs linked to the Keystone XL pipeline that far outstrip those put forward by TransCanada, the would-be builder of the pipeline. Romney says the project would create 131,000 jobs; TransCanada said it would create 13,000 construction jobs and 7,000 jobs with suppliers. (TransCanada's method counted one job done over two years as two jobs.)  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Romney says that, if elected, he would immediately approve the crude-oil pipeline.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another example is the federal limits on pollution from industrial boilers, a hot-button political issue that has drawn intense criticism of the EPA from manufacturers. The Romney plan states that the rules &quot;may put yet another 800,000 jobs at risk,&quot; on top of other new federal air-quality requirements. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the EPA proposed new rules for boilers in April 2010, it announced in December 2011 that it had &quot;reconsidered&quot; the rule. The agency issued a new proposal that could cost $2.3 billion while delivering from $28 billion to $68 billion in health and economic benefits. The agency estimated it would create 2,100 new jobs on balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even industry's job numbers are far more modest than the Romney document. The Council of Industrial Boiler Owners says the revised EPA rule, which may become final this month, could cost 228,000 jobs by imposing $14.4 billion in new pollution control costs. Bob Bessette, the group's president, said the EPA's staff has responded to the concerns of the wood and paper products industry, chemical manufacturers and others.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have come a long way,&quot; Bessette said in an interview. &quot;I believe they, on the staff level, are trying their best to come up with a rule that is achievable. The question is whether the president will allow this to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hank Courtright, senior vice president of global strategy at the Electric Power Research Institute, said he was skeptical of analyses that predicted specific job losses linked to stricter EPA air-quality regulations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't believe anybody's results on that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          'Worrisome' rhetoric          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Ebinger, who directs the Brookings Institution's energy security initiative, said Romney has painted federal rules with too broad a brush on the campaign trail. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, Ebinger noted, highlighted the negative consequences of a lack of federal oversight, though Romney condemns Obama for ordering a drilling moratorium and using the oil spill as &quot;political cover&quot; for bad policies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rhetoric of Romney is worrisome, that all regulation is bad,&quot; Ebinger said, &quot;which isn't to say there isn't some stupid regulation out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Romney invited energy experts to Massachusetts and urged them to put all  alternatives on the table, according to one person who was there. He spent hours looking over slide presentations and entertaining ideas, some of which alarmed his political experts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, Romney wrote in his book &quot;No Apology&quot; about a variety of energy proposals, including &quot;feebates&quot; to reward buyers of fuel-efficient vehicles. He also praised a proposal by one of his advisers, Harvard University professor N. Gregory Mankiw, to institute a &quot;tax swap&quot; - imposing a gasoline or carbon tax while reducing other taxes. &quot;A great deal of work needs to be done if it is to become a viable option,&quot; Romney said. This year, the GOP presidential candidate has surrounded himself with many advisers, such as Mankiw, who worked in the George W. Bush administration. They include James Connaughton, former head of the Council on Environmental Quality and now an executive at Constellation Energy Group; Andrew Karsner, former assistant energy secretary for efficiency and renewables; Mark Maddox, now with the Livingston Group, who worked for the Energy Department focusing on fossil-fuel issues. Maddox oversaw efforts to fund carbon sequestration projects, which have not proved to be economical. Rebecca Rosen, a staff member of Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), joined the campaign this week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Romney has consulted with Harold Hamm, a billionaire oilman and chief executive of Continental Resources who struck it rich with early and aggressive exploration in North Dakota's Bakken formation. The Oklahoma-based Hamm, who says there is as much oil in the Bakken formation as in the proven reserves in the rest of the United States put together, has also hosted fundraisers for Romney. Last fall, he visited Washington to lobby against rollbacks of tax breaks for oil and gas drilling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Romney's current positions appear to be at odds with his views when he was Massachusetts governor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 2005, Romney supported an agreement by Northeastern states to form a regional group to reduce greenhouse gases through a cap-and-trade system that would slightly raise utility rates. &quot;This is a great thing for the Commonwealth,&quot; Romney said,According to a Boston Globe article at the time, Romney said, &quot;We can effectively create incentives to help stimulate a sector of the economy and at the same time not kill jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign's energy plan rejects a similar cap-and-trade approach to greenhouse gases backed by Obama as a &quot;complex scheme&quot; that would have dealt &quot;a crippling blow to the U.S. economy.&quot; In his 2010 book, Romney also tried to distance himself from the regional cap-and-trade plan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Romney has sharply attacked Obama for investing federal dollars in wind and solar projects, Ebinger said that it is unlikely that Romney would cut off all federal research and development funds for renewable energy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In reality, he is a venture capitalist, for better or worse. He would realize R and D [research and development] is very important,&quot; Ebinger said. &quot;I can't see him bowing to the right wing of the Republican Party and saying, 'We won't do any R and D.'&nbsp;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeffrey Hartley, a Salt Lake City-based energy industry consultant and lobbyist, said he got a sense of the GOP candidate's stance after attending eight Romney fundraisers over the past several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything I've heard him say shows he understands the issues we're facing,&quot; Hartley said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, is celebrating 25 years as a member of Congress on Saturday and the celebrations and commemorations of the milestone have been epic. There have been million-dollar fundraisers and lectures with former presidents; San Francisco streets have been named after her; and there were concerts with rock star Bono and the remaining members of the Grateful Dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is not lost on Pelosi - what a long, strange trip it's been. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've exploited it to the hilt,&quot; she joked with reporters recently, adding, &quot;We've got music, we've got streets, we've got bridges. Very immodest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pelosi celebration tour is the latest evidence that she remains an indomitable force in Democratic politics and unequaled in star power among House Democrats. At the same time, the moment has also served to highlight the lack of any obvious heirs apparent to the 72-year-old Pelosi, who is now in her 10th year leading the caucus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pelosi, the first female speaker in history, won't hear any talk of  leaving. She remains focused on what she calls the &quot;Drive for 25,&quot; the number of seats Democrats need to pick up in November for her to become the first person since the legendary Sam Rayburn, in 1955, to reclaim the speakership after losing it it. Part of the reason she chose to publicly exploit this anniversary is the coincidental convergence of the length of her tenure and the number of seats she needs to make history again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did I tell you it's my 25th anniversary? Did I tell you it's the same number, 'Drive for 25,' for control?&quot; she told reporters Thursday. Taking back the House is an obvious long shot for Democrats, and Pelosi is still recovering from the lingering effects of a $70 million ad campaign by national Republicans in 2010 that demonized her in races across the country, leading to a historic 63-seat loss by Democrats in the midterms. After the drubbing, most members of her own caucus expected Pelosi to resign. She did not, and faced token oppositionin her run for minority leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internal rivals acknowledge, even now, that she is secure as head of her caucus and will become speaker if Democrats win the majority this Novemberhttp://www.politico.com/news/stories/0111/47081.html. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If she wants to be, if she gets the breaks this fall, she will be speaker,&quot; said Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), the dean of the House and longest-serving congressman in history. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While she continues to be an unpopular figure among many Americans, Pelosi has receded somewhat from the spotlight that was so inescapable in 2010. This fall the Democrat who Republicans will most seek to undermine is President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a special election Tuesday to replace former representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), Republicans have used only a fleeting image of Pelosi and instead focus on linking Democratic candidate Ron Barber to the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if to underscore her reputation for tirelessness, Pelosi left Washington on Friday for a week-long excursion along the Interstate 95 corridor in the Northeast, planning more than a half-dozen stops at fundraisers for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her fundraising efforts are a key reason that in the first four months of 2012, the DCCC has outraised its Republican counterpart, $28.6 million to $26.1 million, an unheard of development for the minority in an election year in which no independent analysts are predicting a Democratic majority. &quot;She hasn't slowed down 1 mile per hour,&quot; said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), part of a tight clique of veterans that forms Pelosi's kitchen cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Democrats see the anniversary tour as a legacy-building effort by Pelosi. On Thursday, her colleagues delivered speeches on the House floor honoring her accomplishments, then about 120 Democrats crowded into a first-floor committee room for a second surprise party, complete with chocolate cupcakes with &quot;Pelosi 25&quot; written on each. Pelosi's California colleague, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, also came bearing a gift: a framed copy of Pelosi's first speech on the House floor, about fighting AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) recalled their days as congressional interns together, back when a male intern had more power and women answered phones. However, according to those present, Hoyer juxtaposed that with the current setting: &quot;Her sitting at the front desk, me in the back - things have never changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some believe that Pelosi will step down if Democrats do not reclaim the majority in November. If Obama gets reelected, the 2014 midterm elections would provide a historically bad opportunity for congressional Democrats, making the 2016 elections the next chance to claim the majority. If Mitt Romney wins, the 2014 midterms would pose a real chance for Democrats, but Pelosi will turn 75 in March 2015. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one seems to know what her next move will be. Her friends and her staff profess to have no idea how long she wants to do this job. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only she knows that,&quot; said Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.), a close friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some corners Hoyer - her onetime rival for the leader's post and now her understudy for a decade - is presumed to be next in line. But at 73, even Hoyer's allies in the caucus call him a &quot;transitional&quot; leader at best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waiting on the sidelines are a collection of 40- and 50-somethings: Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.), currently serving as Democratic National Committee chairman; Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the ranking member of the Budget Committee; Xavier Becerra (Calif.), the No. 5 ranking member of leadership; Steve Israel (N.Y.), chairman of the DCCC; and Joseph Crowley (N.Y.), a top DCCC fundraiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some are viewed as smart legislative tacticians but poor with fundraising skills; others have good political instincts but no legislative heft. Among rank-and-file lawmakers, views of the people in that group indicate that each is slightly better than average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None is Pelosi, they say.</SPAN></P>

Bob Bessette, the group's president, said the EPA's staff has responded to the concerns of the wood and paper products industry, chemical manufacturers and others.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have come a long way,&quot; Bessette said in an interview. &quot;I believe they, on the staff level, are trying their best to come up with a rule that is achievable. The question is whether the president will allow this to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hank Courtright, senior vice president of global strategy at the Electric Power Research Institute, said he was skeptical of analyses that predicted specific job losses linked to stricter EPA air-quality regulations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't believe anybody's results on that,&quot; he said.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">'Worrisome' rhetoric</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Ebinger, who directs the Brookings Institution's energy security initiative, said Romney has painted federal rules with too broad a brush on the campaign trail. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, Ebinger noted, highlighted the negative consequences of a lack of federal oversight, though Romney condemns Obama for ordering a drilling moratorium and using the oil spill as &quot;political cover&quot; for bad policies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rhetoric of Romney is worrisome, that all regulation is bad,&quot; Ebinger said, &quot;which isn't to say there isn't some stupid regulation out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Romney invited energy experts to Massachusetts and urged them to put all  alternatives on the table, according to one person who was there. He spent hours looking over slide presentations and entertaining ideas, some of which alarmed his political experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, Romney wrote in his book &quot;No Apology&quot; about a variety of energy proposals, including &quot;feebates&quot; to reward buyers of fuel-efficient vehicles. He also praised a proposal by one of his advisers, Harvard University professor N. Gregory Mankiw, to institute a &quot;tax swap&quot; - imposing a gasoline or carbon tax while reducing other taxes. &quot;A great deal of work needs to be done if it is to become a viable option,&quot; Romney said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the GOP presidential candidate has surrounded himself with many advisers, such as Mankiw, who worked in the George W. Bush administration. They include James Connaughton, former head of the Council on Environmental Quality and now an executive at Constellation Energy Group; Andrew Karsner, former assistant energy secretary for efficiency and renewables; Mark Maddox, now with the Livingston Group, who worked for the Energy Department focusing on fossil-fuel issues. Maddox oversaw efforts to fund carbon sequestration projects, which have not proved to be economical. Rebecca Rosen, a staff member of Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), joined the campaign this week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Romney has consulted with Harold Hamm, a billionaire oilman and chief executive of Continental Resources who struck it rich with early and aggressive exploration in North Dakota's Bakken formation. The Oklahoma-based Hamm, who says there is as much oil in the Bakken formation as in the proven reserves in the rest of the United States put together, has also hosted fundraisers for Romney. Last fall, he visited Washington to lobby against rollbacks of tax breaks for oil and gas drilling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Romney's current positions appear to be at odds with his views when he was Massachusetts governor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 2005, Romney supported an agreement by Northeastern states to form a regional group to reduce greenhouse gases through a cap-and-trade system that would slightly raise utility rates. &quot;This is a great thing for the Commonwealth,&quot; Romney said,According to a Boston Globe article at the time, Romney said, &quot;We can effectively create incentives to help stimulate a sector of the economy and at the same time not kill jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign's energy plan rejects a similar cap-and-trade approach to greenhouse gases backed by Obama as a &quot;complex scheme&quot; that would have dealt &quot;a crippling blow to the U.S. economy.&quot; In his 2010 book, Romney also tried to distance himself from the regional cap-and-trade plan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Romney has sharply attacked Obama for investing federal dollars in wind and solar projects, Ebinger said that it is unlikely that Romney would cut off all federal research and development funds for renewable energy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In reality, he is a venture capitalist, for better or worse. He would realize R and D [research and development] is very important,&quot; Ebinger said. &quot;I can't see him bowing to the right wing of the Republican Party and saying, 'We won't do any R and D.'&acirc;[#x20ac][#x2c6]&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeffrey Hartley, a Salt Lake City-based energy industry consultant and lobbyist, said he got a sense of the GOP candidate's stance after attending eight Romney fundraisers over the past several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything I've heard him say shows he understands the issues we're facing,&quot; Hartley said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HENDERSON, Nev. -- The presidential campaigns and their allies are zeroing in mainly on nine swing states, bombarding them with commercials in the earliest concentration of advertising in modern politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With so many resources focused on persuading an ever-shrinking pool of swing voters like those here in Nevada, the 2012 election is likely to go down in history as the one in which the most money was spent reaching the fewest people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the heaviest spending has not been in big cities with large and expensive media markets, but in small and medium-size metropolitan areas in states with little individual weight in the Electoral College: Cedar Rapids and Des Moines in Iowa (6 votes); Colorado Springs and Grand Junction in Colorado (9 votes); Norfolk and Richmond in Virginia (13 votes). Since the beginning of April, four-fifths of the ads that favored or opposed a presidential candidate have been in television markets of modest size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere is this more apparent than in southern Nevada, where a costly and contentious fight is playing out for six electoral votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, ads about President Obama or Mitt Romney have been run nearly 6,000 times in and around Las Vegas since April 11, more than in any other media market in the country during that period, according to the Kantar Media Campaign Media Analysis Group. And the $5 million spent by both sides during that eight-week stretch translates into the highest rate of spending per electoral vote anywhere by far. Underscoring the state's importance this year, Mr. Obama campaigned in Las Vegas on Thursday; Mr. Romney visited last week for a rally and a fund-raiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this effort is to reach just 1.4 million registered voters, a sign of how tight this election is expected to be. And it points to how the country's growing partisan divide has redrawn the political geography, with fewer states than ever not firmly designated ''red'' or ''blue.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study released this week by the Pew Research Center found that the differences between Republicans and Democrats on a wide range of questions -- like whether someone believes in God and what role the government should have in helping the poor -- have never been starker in the 25 years since Pew began the survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These divisions play out on television sets across the sprawling desert developments here, where political ads start with the 4 a.m. newscasts. They appear alongside commercials for bankruptcy lawyers and the ''sizzlin' million-dollar giveaway'' at a supermarket chain, reminders of how the economic recovery has skipped over much of Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one ad, a minute-long spot from the Karl Rove-backed group Crossroads GPS, a litany of Mr. Obama's ''broken promises'' is punctuated by the sound of shattering glass. Another ad uses a stopwatch to drive home the point that the national debt increases $1.4 million every second. It lays the blame squarely at the president's feet (''borrowing from China for his spending,'' it says) despite sharp deficit growth under George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign's presence is equally strong on the air, and it grew even heavier this week with a new $10 million ad campaign in Nevada and eight other states. The latest ad claims that as governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney had ''one of the worst economic records in the country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It is unusual that so few states are in play from an advertising standpoint,'' said Will Feltus, senior vice president of National Media, which researches and plans advertising placement. He said that the sheer amount of money in play this year is a factor. And because neither candidate is accepting public financing, which would put limits on how his campaign spends, the campaigns can be more strategic about how they advertise. ''I think campaigns this year are marshaling their resources more carefully,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the volatility of the electorate, the map could easily expand or contract from the current nine -- Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- in the weeks and months ahead. And advertising is only the most tangible sign of which states are competitive. There are other factors like voter registration and organization that play important roles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no recent general election advertising strategy has covered so little ground so early. In the spring of 2000, George W. Bush and Al Gore fought an air war in close to 20 states. In early 2004, there were the ''Swing Seventeen.'' And in 2008, the Obama campaign included 18 states in its June advertising offensive, its first of the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2012, Nevada offers a clear test case for the economic debates and changing demographics that will determine this election. Nevada has the highest unemployment rate in the country, and one of every 300 homes here is in foreclosure -- more than in any other state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanics, who voted heavily for Mr. Obama in 2008 and are being aggressively courted by both sides this year, are a sizable constituency. Labor unions, another Democratic ally, are especially powerful here. Mormons, an estimated 10 percent of Nevada's electorate, are expected to turn out heavily for Mr. Romney. And Nevada is also already a showcase for the influential role that outside political groups play in a post-Citizens United world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative political groups have spent heavily in recent weeks to counter the $20 million advertising blitz that the Obama campaign started last month in nine states. Groups like Crossroads GPS, the Koch brothers-affiliated Americans for Prosperity and the American Future Fund spent $20 million in May in 10 states -- the aforementioned nine plus Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since April, conservative groups have had a near-continuous presence on television in battleground states, providing Mr. Romney with cover while his campaign remained off the air. In most states the pattern was the same: one group's ad buy picked up when another's ended. In Colorado, Americans for Prosperity started running commercials just as American Future Fund's ads were ending. Then Crossroads stepped in after Americans for Prosperity's buy wound down. The Romney campaign has advertised in only four states -- Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia -- for a total of $4.6 million, an ad buyer who monitors spending said. The campaign has not said publicly where or how much it is advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fall promises to bring wall-to-wall advertising. Already, commercial time in October during N.F.L. and World Series baseball games has been reserved for Congressional campaigns. And the Obama campaign is said to be inquiring about national television ads during the Summer Olympics, according to one person who monitors ad buying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By November, breaking through the clutter will be difficult. But now, at least, some campaign ads seem to be seeping into voters' minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joni Robison, a homemaker from Las Vegas who said the stream of ads on her television has picked up tremendously, seemed to unintentionally echo the theme of a new anti-Obama&nbsp;ad running on heavy rotation here. The ad features a fictional mother of two whose adult children have moved back home because they were unable to find work. The mother says forlornly that the change Mr. Obama promised has not materialized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I have kids, and I don't want to see their future compromised,'' Ms. Robison said as she stood waiting with her daughter and husband for a Romney rally to begin. ''I'm disappointed in some of the promises he made that he wasn't able to keep. I'm disappointed in his performance.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAS VEGAS -- After a day of fund-raisers in California, President Obama on Thursday traveled again to swing-state Nevada for the one event of his two-day Western trip that was designated as an official appearance, as opposed to a campaign stop. But it again illustrated that everything is political in an election year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama campaigned not against Mitt Romney but against Republicans in Congress, saying they ''can't just sit on their hands'' and ignore his job-creation proposals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He emphasized the issue of keeping college loans affordable, a topic which resonates with many younger voters whose support Mr. Obama needs for reelection. And he did so at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, before 2,500 mostly young supporters whose energy and chants of ''four more years'' gave the event the feel of a campaign rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the local newspaper, Mr. Obama's arrival coincided with a new television ad here from his campaign that echoed the president's message. In the ad, Mr. Obama urges Congress to pass the measures he first proposed last September, as part of his job-creation package, to help states pay for keeping teachers and first-responders at work and to finance public infrastructure projects providing jobs for construction workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he told the university crowd, ''Making college affordable -- that's one of the best things we can do for the economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama sought to spread the word that his administration is speeding a change in a 2009 law that will allow people who remain current on repaying their federal Stafford loans to have their repayments capped at 10 percent of their disposable income, down from 15 percent, so borrowers can more easily manage their debt. The change is to take effect in 2014 but the administration wants the cap effective for new loans after this year. Also, Mr. Obama promoted a new directive to his education and treasury secretaries to ease the process of applying for the repayment option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he told the university crowd, ''the No. 1 thing Congress should do for you is to stop interest rates on student loans from going up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reference was to Mr, Obama's fight with Congress over the interest rate on current Stafford loans. The rate, cut in half to 3.4 percent five years ago to help borrowers as the economy soured, is due to return to 6.8 percent on July 1, affecting more than 7 million student loans. While many Republicans, including Mr. Romney, say they agree that the rate should temporarily remain at the lower level, the parties disagree over how to cover the government's one-year cost of $6 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">College debt has exceeded $1 trillion and surpassed total credit-card debt, elevating the issue's political importance, especially at a time when financially strained states are raising tuitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have proposed to offset the cost of subsidizing the lower interest rate by closing a loophole allowing some wealthy taxpayers to avoid Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes by classifying their pay as dividends, not cash income. Republicans first called instead for eliminating a fund for preventive health services in Mr. Obama's health insurance law -- a non-starter for the White House -- but recently sent the president a letter proposing several alternative financing measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''And what has the White House done? Nothing. The president has yet to respond,'' the Senate Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, said in a speech on Thursday in advance of Mr. Obama's arrival in Nevada. ''One can only surmise that he's delaying a solution so that he can fit in a few more campaign rallies with college students while pretending someone other than himself is delaying action.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, the House speaker, John A. Boehner, and the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, called on Mr. Obama to cancel his Las Vegas speech. ''With all of the great economic challenges facing our country, there is no reason to manufacture political fights where there is not policy disagreement,'' they wrote to the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the Republicans' complaints, the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said aboard Air Force One to Nevada, ''We are working with Congress to get this done and we think it will get done.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since April Mr. Obama has raised the interest rate issue and criticized Republicans for opposing his version at college campus events in North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa -- all swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before flying to Nevada, Mr. Obama attended an outdoor breakfast fund-raiser, after two each on Thursday in San Francisco and Los Angeles. About 300 people paid at least $2,500 each to attend the event at a home in a predominantly African-American enclave on a hillside overlooking Los Angeles owned by Charles Quarles, president of the Bedford Group, a real estate development firm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Mitt Romney's campaign feeling the pressure from President Obama's attacks on his record as governor of Massachusetts? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new television ad by Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, responds directly to the attacks, claiming &quot;the best jobs record in a decade&quot; for Mr. Romney while he led the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney reduced unemployment to just 4.7 percent,&quot; the narrator in the ad says. &quot;He balanced every budget without raising taxes. He did it by bringing parties together to cut through gridlock. From Day 1 as president, Mitt Romney's strong leadership will make all the difference on jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear, however, how much money Mr. Romney's campaign was spending on the ad, or how many states it will be running in. A spokeswoman for the campaign refused to disclose any details of the size or scope of the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad follows a $10 million  push in nine battleground states by Mr. Obama's campaign to attack the governor's record in Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad, titled &quot;Heard It Before,&quot; shows Mr. Romney saying that he speaks &quot;the language of business.&quot; But the ad cites newspaper articles that suggest that Mr. Romney presided over one of &quot;the worst economic records in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs,&quot; the narrator says. &quot;And fell to 47th in job creation. Fourth from the bottom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision by Mr. Romney's Boston headquarters to respond directly to Mr. Obama's attacks suggests that the Republican team believes there is political danger in letting them go unanswered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's&nbsp;ad also continues the &quot;Day One&quot; theme that his campaign has been using in television commercials to try and show how a Republican administration would immediately be different from Mr. Obama's presidency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. Romney believe that people have soured on Mr. Obama but want to know how Mr. Romney would be better. The ads are an effort to answer that question in a way that his advisers believe will help Mr. Romney get elected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Friday's exchange between President Obama and Mitt Romney was eerily similar to one between Mr. Obama and Senator John McCain of Arizona in 2008. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, President Obama eagerly seized on Senator John McCain's comment that the &quot;fundamentals of the economy are strong&quot; to paint his Republican rival as out of touch with a plummeting reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Mr. Obama returned the favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeking to prod Congress to provide more money to help prevent layoffs from local and state governments, Mr. Obama stressed how much better off private companies are doing in terms of hiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The private sector is doing fine,&quot; he said, immediately giving Mitt Romney the same kind of bumper-sticker sound bite that Mr. Obama used against Mr. McCain four years ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican machinery leaped into action almost instantly. Congressional leaders posted on Twitter. Party officials started sending out e-mails. And Mr. Romney, campaigning in Iowa, expressed outrage as soon as he could.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said the private sector is doing fine,&quot; Mr. Romney said. &quot;Is he really that out of touch? I think he's defining what it means to be detached and out of touch with the American people. Has there ever been an American president who is so far from reality?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intensity of the Republican attack is a reminder of how quickly a comment can become a significant moment in a presidential campaign, especially in an Internet era that amplifies statements and strips them of context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's reaction to Mr. Obama's comments was an echo of the president's own political strategy four years ago, when he sought to use Mr. McCain's comment against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was September 2008, even as the global economy was crashing, that Mr. McCain said the country's fundamentals were strong. Mr. McCain, then the Republican nominee, was trying to make a broader point about how strong the country was, and how it would recover. But Mr. Obama's campaign ignored the nuance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's stubborn insistence that the 'fundamentals of the economy are strong' shows that he is disturbingly out of touch with what's going in the lives of ordinary Americans,&quot; a spokesman said at the time. &quot;Even as his own ads try to convince him that the economy is in crisis, apparently his 26 years in Washington have left him incapable of understanding that the policies he supports have created a historic economic crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday's exchange between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney was eerily similar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House called the short news conference on Friday morning to give Mr. Obama the chance to needle Republicans in Congress on their refusal to pass parts of his jobs package. He also spent some time commenting about the &quot;headwinds&quot; the country faces from the economic situation in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama seemed intent on making another point. On three separate occasions during the news conference, he drew the distinction between private businesses, which he said are hiring, and local and state governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The private sector is doing fine; where we are seeing weaknesses in our economy had to do with state and local government,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;If Republicans want to be helpful, if they really want to move forward and put people back to work they should be thinking about how do we help state and local government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House officials note that it is a point Mr. Obama has made before, and he has backup to support his point. Job losses among teachers, firefighters, police officers and other government jobs have dragged down the economy and kept unemployment high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And many private companies have begun to hire again. Big corporations are reporting record profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the political impact of his words, much like Mr. McCain's comments four years ago, are not likely to be wiped away with an explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within just a few hours, the Republican National Committee had already produced a Web video titled &quot;Doing Fine&quot; to highlight Mr. Obama's comments. It contrasts Mr. Obama's statement to recent grim headlines about the economy stalling. The R.N.C. video is virtually identical to an ad that Mr. Obama ran against Mr. McCain in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can President Obama fix our economy,&quot; it asks, &quot;if he doesn't understand what's broken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A television advertisement can't be far behind. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign, which has had a scant presence on the air in recent weeks, on Friday added Colorado, New Hampshire and Nevada to the states where it is running television commercials, according to a media buyer who monitors political spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its purchases were small and for just four days, with the new round of advertisements starting on Saturday -- $216,000 in Colorado (Denver, Colorado Springs and Grand Junction); $82,000 in New Hampshire (Manchester only); $113,000 in Nevada (Las Vegas and Reno). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney's campaign had already committed another $1.5 million to advertising in Ohio, Iowa and Virginia during that same period, giving him a modest presence on the air in those states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, the Romney campaign has committed $7.1 million to advertising since mid-May. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has put $30 million into its advertising offensive, most recently adding to its broadcast television efforts with a $10 million campaign attacking Mr. Romney's tenure as Massachusetts governor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the air wars are far from a lopsided fight. Mr. Romney has had the backing of Crossroads GPS, the Karl Rove-affiliated political group, which is in the midst of a $25 million advertising blitz in 10 states. Those advertisements have tried to tap into disappointment with Mr. Obama's presidency and anxiety over the economy. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since President Obama's health care law passed in 2010, the federal government, states, insurers, doctors and hospitals have been building a complex scaffolding to extend insurance to 30 million more Americans. The question is: Will the structure be completed, or dismantled?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Supreme Court decision expected as early as Monday could eliminate a key plank of the law: the mandate that nearly everyone obtain insurance. The court also is weighing whether to strike down other sections of the new insurance marketplaces where 20 million people -- those already with individual policies and those seeking them -- are supposed to find health plans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, 14 states -- including California, Colorado and West Virginia -- have authorized the creation of online &quot;exchanges&quot; where, starting in 2014, those who aren't covered by employers can buy insurance. In addition, doctors, hospitals and insurers have been changing the way they do business as they prepare for an influx of  customers and new incentives that reward more coordination between healers, more preventative care and financial penalties on poor performers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The train is really well out of the station at this point,&quot; says Sara Collins, a vice president at the Commonwealth Fund, a health foundation in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The justices also will decide whether to block the government from broadening the federal-state Medicaid program to cover 17 million additional people, the program's greatest expansion since it was created a half-century ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The  court decision could affect millions of Americans, including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People without insurance. By the year 2021, 39 million Americans would lack health insurance if the justices overturn the mandate to obtain insurance, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. That would be 16 million more people than if the justices leave the law intact, the CBO says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who currently can't get insurance on the open market because they have ailments that make insurers either refuse to cover them or charge them a  higher rate than healthy people. The law requires that insurers accept all applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young adults covered under their parents' policies, as well as very sick people who now have limited coverage that has left them with huge medical expenses. The law has already required that insurers must allow families to keep covering offspring up to age 26, and it banned insurers from placing limits on the maximum amounts they would pay for anyone's care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those looking for affordable health coverage in exchanges. RAND Corp., a Santa Monica, Calif., think tank, says premiums would rise 2.4% if the justices nix the  mandate but leave the rest of the law in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say it's impossible to predict what the court will do, given the range of potential options outlined in court pleadings. The justices could leave the  law intact or strike down just the mandate. They might  eliminate the rule that limits how much more insurers can charge older people than they do younger folks, or the rule requiring plans to accept  customers regardless of health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or the justices could strike down larger sections of the law that include financial subsidies, averaging $4,780, that would help lower income people buy coverage in the exchanges. They could get rid of the Medicaid expansion. Finally, they could throw out the entire law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts on both sides of the debate agree the  mandate is the most legally vulnerable piece, but disagree about how crucial it is to making the  insurance markets work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sabrina Corlette, a professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute in Washington who supports the law, says that if the court strikes down the mandate, it &quot;would be quite chaotic and disruptive&quot; because healthy people are less likely to join the health insurance pools. If the court strikes down the broader insurance rules for the exchanges, she says, &quot;then we're back to the status quo of people being denied because they have preexisting conditions, or being told because they have cancer they'll be charged 26 times that of a healthy person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Antos of the American Enterprise Institute, who opposes the law, says the mandate's importance has been exaggerated, especially given the weakness of the penalties for people who don't get coverage. Those start at $95 in 2014 and rise to 2.5% of income by 2016, but there are multiple ways people could be exempted, he says. &quot;I just don't see the insurance market collapsing&quot; if the court strikes down the mandate or other parts of the law, Antos says. He predicts insurers would keep some popular provisions that have already begun, such as family coverage for dependents up to age 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law's ultimate future may rest  with whichever party wins the White House and Congress in November, says Charlene Frizzera, a health care consultant and former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has said he would dismantle the law. If Obama is re-elected but the court strikes the insurance mandate, his administration would have a number of ways to write rules that prod people to get insurance, such as charging more to people who wait until they are sick to sign up.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign's attack ad about Bain Capital presented a simplistic picture of a complicated reality. Private-equity firms can play a crucial role in keeping companies competitive. And although some firms have engaged in some bad practices, on the whole the industry has grown so large because it performs a useful function. But the worst part about the ad was that it had little to do with America's challenges or Obama's policies.          By contrast, Mitt Romney's first major ad is substantive - and wrong. He tells us that on his first day in office - after approving the Keystone XL pipeline - he will &quot;introduce tax cuts . . . that reward job creators, not punish them.&quot; The one idea that is almost certain not to jump-start this economy is a tax cut.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why can we be sure of this? Because that is what we have done for the past three years. For those who think  President Obama's policies have done little to produce growth, keep in mind that the single largest piece of his policies - in dollar terms - has been tax cuts. They actually began before Obama, with the tax cut passed under the George W. Bush administration in response to the financial crisis in 2008. Then came the stimulus bill, of which tax cuts were the largest chunk by far - one-third of the total. The Transportation Department, by contrast, got 6 percent of the total to fix infrastructure.          That wasn't the end of it. There was the payroll tax cut, the small business tax cut, the extension of the payroll tax cut, and so on. The president's Twitter feed boasted  : &quot;President Obama has signed 21 tax cuts to support middle-class families.&quot; And how has that worked out?          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of a financial crisis caused by excessive debt, tax cuts are highly unlikely to lead to increased economic activity. People use the money to pay down their debts rather than shop for cars, houses and appliances. As for the idea that job creators are not creating jobs because their taxes are too high, think about it: Would Mitt Romney invest more of his money in U.S. factories if only he had paid less than the 13.9 percent rate he paid last year? Please!             The Wall Street Journal invoked Milton Friedman to say that the problem with all of these tax cuts is that they are temporary. If only we had across-the-board cuts in rates. Except that these were tried as well. The 2001 Bush tax cuts were designed precisely along those lines. They were, in dollar terms, the largest tax cuts in U.S. history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          And the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service concluded in 2010 that &quot;by almost any economic indicator, the economy performed better in the period before the [Bush] tax cuts than after the tax cuts were enacted. . . . GDP growth, median real household income growth, weekly hours worked, the employment-population ratio, personal savings, and business investment growth were all lower in the period after the tax cuts were enacted.&quot; The years 2000 to 2007 were the period of the weakest job growth in the United States since the Great Depression.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one certain effect of tax cuts would be to balloon the deficit. Bruce Bartlett, a former economic official under Ronald Reagan, points out that the aggregate revenue loss of the Bush tax cuts was the largest in U.S. history. &quot;Both Harry Truman and Ronald Reagan passed larger individual tax cuts, but both took back about half of them with subsequent tax increases.&quot;When pressed, Romney and his advisers sometimes say that they are just for tax reform; other times, they cite the Simpson-Bowles commission's plan. I've long argued that reforming the nation's bloated and corrupt tax code is vital and that Simpson-Bowles is a superb framework for deficit reduction. But neither will cut taxes. Simpson-Bowles raises them by more than a trillion dollars. You can use euphemisms such as &quot;ending tax expenditures&quot; and &quot;closing loopholes,&quot; but when you do that, someone's taxes will go up. And when you close big loopholes such as the deduction of mortgage interest - which is the only way to get real revenue - tens of millions of peoples' taxes will go up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Tax cuts have been a central cause of America's deficit problems. For four decades, Washington politicians have bought popularity by cutting taxes, always saying that spending cuts or growth will make up for lost revenue. That has rarely happened, and the result is $11 trillion in federal debt held by the public. To perpetuate this pandering one more time is not just dishonest - it is dangerous.          </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign's attack ad about  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/obama-ad-calls-mitt-romneys-bain-capital-firm-a-vampire/2012/05/14/gIQA25BdOU_blog.html&quot;                 title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com-URL-Bain Capital  presented a simplistic picture of a complicated reality. Private-equity firms can play a crucial role in keeping companies competitive. And although some firms have engaged in some bad practices, on the whole the industry has grown so large because it performs a useful function. But the worst part about the ad was that it had little to do with America's challenges or Obama's policies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Mitt Romney's  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/mitt-romney-makes-day-one-promises-in-ad/2012/05/18/gIQAHOuFYU_blog.html&quot;                 title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com-URL-first major ad  is substantive - and wrong. He tells us that on his first day in office - after approving the Keystone XL pipeline - he will &quot;introduce tax cuts . . . that reward job creators, not punish them.&quot; The one idea that is almost certain not to jump-start this economy is a tax cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why can we be sure of this? Because that is what we have done for the past three years. For those who think   President Obama's policies have done little to produce growth, keep in mind that the single largest piece of his policies - in dollar terms - has been tax cuts. They actually began before Obama, with the tax cut passed under the George W. Bush administration in response to the financial crisis in 2008. Then came the http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-stimulus-bill-three-years-later/2012/02/17/gIQAdS2LKR_blog.html&quot;                 title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com-URL-stimulus bill , of which tax cuts were the largest chunk by far - one-third of the total. The Transportation Department, by contrast, got  http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2012/mar/23/peter-defazio/did-transportation-projects-create-more-one-third-/&quot;                 title=&quot;www.politifact.com-URL-6 percent of the total  to fix infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That wasn't the end of it. There was the payroll tax cut, the small business tax cut, the extension of the  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/06/AR2010120605923.html www.washingtonpost.com-URL-payroll tax cut, and so on. The president's https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/208293502671523841 Twitter feed boasted: &quot;President Obama has signed 21 tax cuts to support middle-class families.&quot; And how has that worked out?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of a financial crisis caused by excessive debt, tax cuts are highly unlikely to lead to increased economic activity. People use the money to pay down their debts rather than shop for cars, houses and appliances. As for the idea that job creators are not creating jobs because their taxes are too high, think about it: Would Mitt Romney invest more of his money in U.S. factories if only he had paid less than the  http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romney-releases-tax-returns/2012/01/23/gIQAj5bUMQ_story.html&quot;                 title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com-URL-13.9 percent rate he paid last year ? Please!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122757149157954723.html&quot;                 title=&quot;online.wsj.com-URL-The Wall Street Journal  invoked Milton Friedman to say that the problem with all of these tax cuts is that they are temporary. If only we had across-the-board cuts in rates. Except that these were tried as well. The  http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41443.pdf&quot; title=&quot;www.fas.org-URL-2001 Bush tax cuts  were designed precisely along those lines. They were, in dollar terms, the largest tax cuts in U.S. history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the nonpartisan  http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41443.pdf&quot; title=&quot;www.fas.org-URL-Congressional Research Service concluded  in 2010 that &quot;by almost any economic indicator, the economy performed better in the period before the [Bush] tax cuts than after the tax cuts were enacted. . . . GDP growth, median real household income growth, weekly hours worked, the employment-population ratio, personal savings, and business investment growth were all lower in the period after the tax cuts were enacted.&quot; The years 2000 to 2007 were the period of the weakest job growth in the United States since the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one certain effect of tax cuts would be to balloon the deficit.  http://books.google.com/books?id=tMco5vGOaiIC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;lpg=PA215&amp;dq=Both+Harry+Truman+and+Ronald+Reagan+passed+larger+individual+tax+cuts,+but+both+took+back+about+half+of+them+with+subsequent+tax+increases&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qT9g5ilh9G&amp;sig=g_N7PHf34w1KLfRa6oZPW4aaIN4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pc3PT9PAIsTn0QGmuu2CCA&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Both%20Harry%20Truman%20and%20Ronald%20Reagan%20passed%20larger%20individual%20tax%20cuts%2C%20but%20both%20took%20back%20about%20half%20of%20them%20with%20subsequent%20tax%20increases&amp;f=false&quot;                 title=&quot;books.google.com-URL-Bruce Bartlett , a former economic official under Ronald Reagan, points out that the aggregate revenue loss of the Bush tax cuts was the largest in U.S. history. &quot;Both Harry Truman and Ronald Reagan passed larger individual tax cuts, but both took back about half of them with subsequent tax increases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When pressed, Romney and his advisers sometimes say that they are just for tax reform; other times, they cite the  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-reason-the-white-house-didnt-embrace-simpson-bowles/2011/08/25/gIQAq1j2dR_blog.html&quot;                 title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com-URL-Simpson-Bowles  commission's plan.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/be-thankful--sensible-solutions-do-exist-for-us-problems/2011/11/23/gIQAW7pCqN_story.html&quot;                 title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com-URL-I've long argued  that reforming the nation's bloated and corrupt tax code is vital and that Simpson-Bowles is a superb framework for deficit reduction. But neither will cut taxes. Simpson-Bowles raises them by more than a trillion dollars. You can use euphemisms such as &quot;ending tax expenditures&quot; and &quot;closing loopholes,&quot; but when you do that, someone's taxes will go up. And when you close big loopholes such as the deduction of mortgage interest - which is the only way to get real revenue - tens of millions of peoples' taxes will go up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax cuts have been a central cause of America's deficit problems. For four decades, Washington politicians have bought popularity by cutting taxes, always saying that spending cuts or growth will make up for lost revenue. That has rarely happened, and the result is  http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/&quot; title=&quot;www.brillig.com-URL-$11 trillion in federal debt  held by the public. To perpetuate this pandering one more time is not just dishonest - it is dangerous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">560 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Gov. Scott Walker moved to strip Wisconsin public employees of their collective-bargaining rights last year, a few weeks after taking office, it was clear that he wasn't doing it to save the state money. If that had been the case, he would have accepted the unions' agreement to pay far more in health care and pension costs. His real goal was political: to break the unions by demonizing their ''bosses,'' ending their ability even to collect dues and removing them as a source of money and energy for Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, as Mr. Walker easily fought off a recall by a 7-point margin over his challenger, it became clear just how effective that strategy has been. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To start, labor failed to nominate its preferred candidate last month to run against Mr. Walker. Instead, Democrats chose Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee, who then barely talked about collective-bargaining rights, sensing it would not help him. Nearly a third of union voters (presumably from private-sector unions) voted for Mr. Walker, exit polls showed, as did nearly half of voters from union households who were not union members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of those union voters, like many others, undoubtedly felt that recalls should be reserved for official misconduct. But, clearly, over the course of 18 months, Mr. Walker and his allies managed to convince even union households in a former labor bastion that bargaining rights for public sector employees were bad for the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did he do that? With the aid of more than $45.6 million, most of it from outside the state, that paid for ads praising him for his ''courage'' in taking on unions and attacking labor for its ''selfish'' intransigence. As one ad put it, ''Labor union mobs led by Barack Obama's Organizing for America are trying to intimidate and harass Governor Walker and lawmakers in Madison, simply because they're finally doing the right thing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Walker's campaign raised seven times as much money as Mr. Barrett's, much of it in six-figure checks from some of the same business interests contributing millions to Republican ''super PACs'' and advocacy groups this year, including Sheldon Adelson and Bob Perry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This money has by no means bought a guarantee that Mitt Romney will seize Wisconsin in November; exit polls showed the same voters preferred President Obama by 51 percent to 44 percent. The state is improving economically, with a lower jobless rate than the nation, which may benefit the president as much as Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, from the beginning, the money behind Governor Walker was intended to turn a once-reliable blue state into a laboratory for Republican ideas, where business could grow free of union fetters, taxes could be cut and thousands of people could be removed from Medicaid rolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why David Koch, the billionaire industrialist whose family money was crucial to Mr. Walker's election in 2010, gave $1 million to the Republican Governors Association this year, which, in turn, ran ads supporting Mr. Walker. Mr. Koch said Mr. Walker's fight against public unions was ''critically important.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tactics worked in Wisconsin, and in several other states. Labor, so long in decline in the private sector, is also losing its clout in states and cities, unable to match or withstand the unfettered bank accounts of industry. The people who kept Mr. Walker and his policies in power are just getting started.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES - Nearly a month after President Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage, on Wednesday night he got a rousing reception and at least $2.5 million at a gala of gay rights supporters and a private, celebrity-studded dinner afterward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama was introduced at the gala by an Army surgeon who benefited from the president's repeal of the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; law against openly gay people in the military. And his appearance on the ballroom stage of a Beverly Hills hotel here provoked a long standing ovation and chants of &quot;four more years&quot; that Mr. Obama finally brought to an end after nearly two minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The celebratory air was a bit of a contrast with a similar gala in New York City a year ago, when Mr. Obama's mostly well-received speech to gay donors was repeatedly interrupted by hecklers in support of same-sex marriage and some attendees were visibly unenthusiastic. At the time, Mr. Obama supported civil unions and opposed marriage between people of the same gender, though he said his position was &quot;evolving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet in Beverly Hills on Wednesday, it was not same-sex marriage but Mr. Obama's repeal in late 2010 of &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; that was the most prominent topic - just as it often receives the most applause at Mr. Obama's campaign events generally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama began by paying tribute to his introducer, Dr. Vito Imbasciani, who served three tours treating soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, hiding the fact that he had a husband and two adopted sons at home. (&quot;I kept their existence a secret, because that's what the law required. But not anymore,&quot; Dr. Imbasciani told the crowd.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the president closed by grafting a new anecdote for the occasion onto what had largely been until that point his usual stump speech. Mr. Obama said that during his family's annual holiday visit to Hawaii last December, during his daily workouts at a military base, four times Marines interrupted to thank him for ending &quot;don't ask, don't tell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day before he returned to Washington, Mr. Obama said, a &quot;very fit&quot; Marine approached. After first telling the commander-in-chief, &quot;You're not doing that exercise right, sir,&quot; the Marine said to Mr. Obama, &quot;I can't tell you how much it means to me that you repealed 'don't ask, don't tell.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said he assumed this Marine was gay, like the others before him, and asked him if he had been wrestling with the issue for long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, sir, I'm not gay,&quot; the Marine replied. &quot;It was important to me because I've had friends in my unit that were and I knew how much it tore them up, and I didn't think it was right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, his voice rising, told his supporters, &quot;I tell that story so that if anybody out there asks you what this campaign is about, you tell them it's still about hope and change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only weeks ago, the annual fundraising dinner of Mr. Obama's LGBT Leadership Council, which he formed during his 2008 campaign for his lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender donors, had loomed as a potentially awkward event as many of the supporters had grown impatient with his talk of a still-evolving position on same-sex marriage. But after Mr. Obama announced his support in early May, the gala had to be moved to the larger venue, the Regent Beverly Wilshire hotel, when demand for tickets spiked, organizers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the roughly 600 attendees, who paid at least $1,250 each, were the openly gay comedian Ellen DeGeneres; Cher, the singer and actress, long popular with gay Americans, who has a transgender son, Chaz Bono; Jesse Tyler Ferguson, a gay actor who plays a married gay parent on the hit television show &quot;Modern Family&quot;; Darren Criss, who plays a gay student on the hit television show &quot;Glee&quot;; and Peter Roth, chief executive of Warner Bros. Television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 70 people paid $25,000 each, or $40,000 a couple, to hear and question Mr. Obama at a private dinner that followed at the Beverly Hills home of Ryan Murphy, creator of &quot;Glee,&quot; and his fianc&eacute;, the photographer David Miller. The actress Reese Witherspoon was there and, according to an Obama campaign official and organizers, so were the &quot;Glee&quot; star Jane Lynch and the actress Julia Roberts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Mr. Obama reached Los Angeles on Wednesday, he stopped in San Francisco for two fund-raisers: a private meeting with about two dozen donors from the technology field who contributed $35,800 each, and then a luncheon for about 250 supporters who paid $5,000 each. As usual, the proceeds from the California events benefit Mr. Obama's campaign, the Democratic National Committee and some state Democratic Party organizations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TheDodd-Frank financial reform legislation of 2010 stipulates that banks and the corporate entities that own banks should get out of the business of &quot;proprietary trading.&quot; That term refers to investments, often highly risky, that very big banks got into the habit making on their own account, i.e., unrelated to anything that their customers asked them to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such bets have the potential to break a bank, creating either an unacceptable liability for taxpayers or a serious risk to the financial system, or both. They also often put these megabanks in the conflicted position of betting against their customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulators involved in drawing up the rules to carry out Dodd-Frank include the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Securities and Exchange Commission. They have still not been able to complete the rules, in part because, as with anything to do with modern finance, the details are complex. The draft regulations and explanations run 116 pages in the Federal Register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C.F.T.C. held a roundtable on those current draft rules on May 31; I've taken part in many discussions on financial reform in the last four years, and this was one of the best. The commission invited some leading experts on financial reform, individually and collectively with a great deal of practical experience - and skeptical of big banks' ability to manage their risk-taking appropriately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet I remain pessimistic that regulators will adopt a strong final Volcker Rule in the near term, partly because of recent disclosures about the efforts of Senator Scott Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, to blunt the impact of the rule, and what these activities tell us about the November elections.<BR><BR>At one level, the tone and content of the exchange at the roundtable were very encouraging. Sheila Bair, former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, led off the discussion with a clear and powerful statement - banks should not be able to use government-guaranteed deposits as a basis for speculation. Any bank with insured deposits receives, in effect, a subsidy - and in return it must behave responsibly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This set the theme for the day, which broadened to include the various ways in which global megabanks receive subsidies by being too big to fail. When things go well, executives and traders at these banks receive the upside. When they are unlucky - or when their risk management systems break down - and downside risk materializes, it is someone else's problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the country's largest banks originally planned to attend the roundtable, but, according to published news reports, they pulled out after JPMorgan Chase's unexpected multibillion-dollar trading losses were disclosed. The elephants were therefore not in the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they were well represented by lawyers appearing on behalf of two industry associations, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. A consulting company, IHS, also discussed a report it had prepared for Morgan Stanley. And there were other organizations present that take the side of American megabanks (as well as Credit Suisse and Barclays, which are Swiss and British, respectively, but which perceive themselves as sharing some of the same interests).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big banks' wing of the debate displayed a fascinating degree of resistance to the notion that they receive large implicit taxpayer subsidies. They had three main counterarguments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first line of reasoning is that the Dodd-Frank financial reforms &quot;ended too-big-to-fail,&quot; a patently false assertion about the current situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true that under Title II of Dodd-Frank, the F.D.I.C. is in charge of preparing ways to liquidate systemically important financial institutions without causing systemwide distress or panic. But this mechanism is not yet in place and, even if it were, substantial technical and political difficulties would remain. (I'm on the F.D.I.C.'s Systemic Resolution Advisory Panel and I support its efforts, but this will be a long slog.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When pressed, no one in the room seemed to think that JPMorgan Chase or any other behemoth could really fail - implying losses for their creditors - any time soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second counterargument is that we need the biggest American banks at their current scale and scope, because otherwise &quot;liquidity&quot; in markets will dry up (in this context, liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and sell particular securities, preferably without moving the price much).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notion is that only the megabanks can provide the necessary market-making, particularly in debt and associated derivatives - thus allowing nonfinancial companies to finance themselves and hedge their operational risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Parsons, my colleague at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an expert on derivatives, including their use by nonfinancial companies, pointed out the fundamental flaw in this reasoning. If a market-making activity is truly valuable and big banks are really unable to provide this service because of the Volcker Rule, someone else will step up - and make money through filling a genuine customer need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is how markets work. (A blog post by Professor Parsons also demolishes the logic behind the IHS report on this issue.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lynn Stout of Cornell University made the important point that liquidity per se is not necessarily a good thing. The road to financial crisis is littered with forms of debt that were considered highly liquid until they weren't - think of Greek sovereign debt or complex American mortgage-backed securities and their derivatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artificially pumping up market liquidity through too-big-to-fail subsidies to market makers is not a good idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along the same lines, allowing big banks to speculate wildly under the guise of hedging their risks is not a good idea. With more details now surfacing about how big risks were taken and mismanaged at JPMorgan Chase, this argument is currently being played down by the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third argument was the strangest: industry representatives and their allies do not see the subsidies; therefore they do not exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc Jarsulic of Better Markets pointed out in plain English that the big advantage is in lowering the overall funding costs for bank holding companies. Exactly how sophisticated financial-sector analysts can refuse to comprehend this notion is beyond understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JPMorgan Chase and similar scale organizations can borrow more cheaply because creditors believe there is downside protection provided by some combination of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, I know that the emergency powers of the Federal Reserve were changed - some would say curtailed - by Dodd-Frank. It is no longer so easy to provide support to an individual financial entity, as was done for A.I.G. in September 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I've also spent a great deal of time discussing the details of this issue in the last two years, with both private-sector and government experts (some at the Fed, others not) - and the simple fact remains that the Fed can devise means of support when needed, more easily to banks but probably to any entity whose imminent collapse is deemed to pose a risk to the financial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The markets correctly perceive this to be the case. Any other position you hear from officials is simply a form of denial - and should be seen as a great source of concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The credit of the Treasury and the financial firepower of our central bank effectively support the credit of JPMorgan Chase (and the other too-big-to-fail entities).  This is what it means to have an implicit government guarantee - a point discussed at the roundtable with Gary Gensler, the C.F.T.C. chairman, during one of his very effective interventions on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over all, the roundtable went about as well as it could for people who want big banks effectively excluded from proprietary trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frankly, however, I don't think executives at big banks will lose much sleep over what happened at the meeting. Their strongest game is not in the public debate but behind closed doors. They will no doubt release another torrent of comment letters, designed to slow the implementation of the Volcker Rule further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are inclined to push the other way, comment letters are still being accepted; I recommend matching the industry in terms of length and details. (A link on the C.F.T.C.'s Web site allows individuals to submit comments on the Volcker Rule until June 22.) Knowledgeable former industry participants could usefully supplement letters by requesting meetings with officials and arguing their points directly; the team at Occupy the S.E.C. has done this ably. Dennis Kelleher's organization, Better Markets, has also been most effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The megabank strategy is to delay as much as possible until after the November election, while pouring money into the campaigns of Republicans who would like to roll back the Volcker Rule or even repeal Dodd-Frank entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Boston Globe reported this week that a senior staff member for Senator Scott Brown has been pushing for a relaxation of crucial Dodd-Frank provisions, particularly with regard to how big banks are allowed to invest in various off-balance-sheet funds. (Remember that Citigroup, for example, largely blew itself up in 2007-8 through such investments.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my assessment, as I told The Globe, these recommendations or requests would substantially undermine the effective constraints intended by the Volcker Rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Brown continues to present himself as a financial reformer while taking very large contributions from Wall Street (which may well increase after the Globe article). This dissonance may well become the prevailing theme of the November elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama missed his chance to reform the financial system by breaking up the largest half-dozen banks - making them small enough and simple enough to fail. On many specific points, he listened to those in the White House and the Treasury who advised him to do relatively little with regard to the megabanks. &quot;Don't do too much&quot; was the theme, particularly during the Senate debate on limiting the scale and scope of our biggest banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the very big banks and their executives are contributing to Mitt Romney in his campaign against President Obama and are concentrating resources against anyone who wants to reform the financial system (or keep in place what limited reforms we have). The targets include Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate opposing Senator Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This issue will not be decided in a C.F.T.C. conference room, through interagency deliberation or even by the thousands of pages of industry-sponsored comment letters that will drown the regulators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcome for the Volcker Rule will ultimately be decided in an election in which there are no effective constraints on campaign spending by special interests - and the megabanks will outspend everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidates who do the bidding of big banks will present themselves as financial reformers and spend a great deal on television advertisements to persuade the electorate that this is so. Watch Senator Brown's campaign closely for details.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first look at the 2012 FiveThirtyEight presidential forecast has Barack Obama as a very slight favorite to win re-election. But his advantage equates to only a two-point lead in the national popular vote, and the edge could easily swing to Mitt Romney on the basis of further bad economic news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama remains slightly ahead of Mr. Romney in most national polls, and he has had a somewhat clearer advantage in polling conducted at the state level. Mr. Obama would be about 80 percent likely to win an election held today, according to the model. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the outlook for the Nov. 6 election is much less certain, with Mr. Obama having winning odds of just over 60 percent. The forecast currently calls for Mr. Obama to win roughly 290 electoral votes, but outcomes ranging everywhere from about 160 to 390 electoral votes are plausible, given the long lead time until the election and the amount of news that could occur between now and then. Both polls and economic indicators are a pretty rough guide five months before an election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forecast works by running simulations of the Electoral College, which are designed to consider the uncertainty in the outcome at the national level and in individual states. It recognizes that voters in each state could be affected by universal factors - like a rising or falling economic tide - as well as by circumstances particular to each state. Furthermore, it considers the relationships between the states and the ways they might move in tandem with one another. Demographically similar states like Minnesota and Wisconsin, for instance, are more likely to move in the same direction than dissimilar ones like New Hampshire and New Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the model - which is distinct from the electoral map put together by The Times's political desk - relies fairly heavily on polling, it also considers an index of national economic conditions. Right now, the polls and the economy are broadly in agreement with one another - both point toward an extremely tight race - although the economic risks to Mr. Obama are somewhat to the downside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, while the economic indicators suggest that the economy is growing sluggishly - at a below-average pace of about 2 percent growth per year - it is not yet in recession and incumbent presidents often receive the benefit of the doubt from voters. A favorable precedent for Mr. Obama is George W. Bush, who narrowly won re-election in 2004 under similar circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the confusing aspects of this presidential race so far is that national polls have often shown a race that is nearly tied - or Mr. Romney sometimes leading - while Mr. Obama has more often had the lead in polls of crucial battleground states. Sites that project the presidential outcome based on the state polls have thus seemed to show a tangible advantage for Mr. Obama, while those that look at the trend in national polls seem to imply that the race is too close to call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any evaluation of the presidential race needs to reconcile this discrepancy. That America is highly divided along partisan lines does not negate the basic mathematical identity that the whole must equal the sum of the parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hypothesis might be that Mr. Obama enjoys some sort of intrinsic edge in the Electoral College - and that, like Mr. Bush in 2000, he could win the Electoral College while losing the nationwide popular vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our analysis suggests, however, that this is not necessarily the case. The model's simulations estimate that there is only about a 2 percent chance that Mr. Obama will win Electoral College while losing the popular vote. Meanwhile, there is only about a 3 percent chance that Mr. Romney will do so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the disparity between state and national polls probably stems from a more banal factor: it likely results from the different types of polling firms that are active in each of these domains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The polling firms that have dominated the national polls are Gallup and Rasmussen Reports, each of which release national tracking numbers on a daily basis. These firms have had Republican-leaning &quot;house effects&quot; so far, meaning that they show more favorable results for Mr. Romney than the consensus of polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, some pollsters that are more active at the state level, like Public Policy Polling and Marist College, have had Democratic-leaning house effects, giving Mr. Obama better results than the consensus does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When such disparities have arisen in past elections, it has not necessarily been the case that the national polls have provided for a superior prediction. Instead, a more accurate estimate of the national popular vote could sometimes be arrived at by aggregating state polls together. Still, the model assumes that the truth is somewhere in between: the national polls probably underestimate Mr. Obama's standing slightly, while the state polls overestimate it some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to suggest, however, that Electoral College strategy will have no bearing on the race. If the national margin remains close, the campaigns will have some difficult decisions to make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The model suggests that the campaigns might do best to concentrate their resources. As much as campaign operatives love to talk about how they are expanding the map, contemplating unusual parlays of states in which they reach 270 electoral votes, the election is very likely to come down to a mere handful of states. In many ways, the relative ordering of the states is more predictable than how the election as a whole will play out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The term the model uses for these key states is tipping point states, meaning that they could tip the balance between winning and losing in an election that came down to the final vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foremost among these tipping point states are Ohio and Virginia. In 2008, both states had a very slight Republican lean relative to the rest of the country. However, the economy is comparatively good in each state, and Mr. Obama's polling has held up reasonably well in them, putting them almost exactly in balance. Mr. Obama is given just slightly over 50 percent odds of winning each one, just as he is given a very slight overall lead in our national projection. But if Mr. Obama's national standing slips, he would probably lose his lead in those states as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the next tier of states are Colorado, Iowa, Nevada and Pennsylvania. The first three of these states project to be almost as close as Ohio and Virginia, but they are somewhat less important than it because they contain fewer electoral votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania is the reverse case: it is more of a reach for Mr. Romney, but has 20 electoral votes and therefore offers him a huge reward. Even if Mr. Obama were to win states like Virginia and Colorado, it would be nearly impossible for him to win the Electoral College if he lost both Ohio and Pennsylvania along with Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken by itself, however, Florida may be a less valuable prize than usual. Right now, the polls there show almost an exact tie. But the model views Florida as leaning toward Mr. Romney, for several reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the polls showing a tie there were mostly conducted among registered voters rather than likely voters. Republicans typically improve their standing by a point or two when polling firms switch from registered voter to likely voter polls, probably because Republican voters are older, wealthier, and otherwise have demographic characteristics that make them more reliable bets to turn out. The model anticipates this pattern and adjusts for it, bolstering Mr. Romney's standing by a point or two whenever it evaluates a registered-voter poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the fundamentals somewhat favor Mr. Romney in Florida. The state has been somewhat Republican-leaning in the past, and its economy is quite poor. Mr. Romney has raised more money than Mr. Obama there, and its demographics are not especially strong for Mr. Obama. The model considers these factors in addition to the polls in each state. In the case of Florida, they equate to Mr. Romney having about a 60 or 65 percent chance of winning it, and Mr. Obama probably has easier paths to 270 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other states that are sometimes considered battlegrounds are even less likely to swing the national outcome. Mr. Obama has only about a 30 percent chance of carrying North Carolina again, according to the model. In the instances where he does, it will most likely come along for the ride only after Mr. Obama has already accumulated enough electoral votes elsewhere to win another term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, although Republicans might be tempted to make a play for Wisconsin after winning the gubernatorial recall election there on Tuesday. The model suggests that it is over-hyped as a swing state. Mr. Obama has had a fairly consistent lead in the polls there, including in the exit poll among voters who turned out on Tuesday. Although Mr. Obama is unlikely to win Wisconsin by 14 points, as he did in 2008, all indications from the polls are that the state remains somewhat more favorable to him than the country as a whole, meaning that is not quite at the electoral tipping point and is more like Mr. Romney's equivalent of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is an unheralded state that could be in play this year, it might be Oregon. Oregon has been sparsely polled, but the most recent survey found a tight race there, and the state has been extremely competitive in the past - like in 2000 when Al Gore won it by less than a full percentage point. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, all of this could be outweighed by a shift in economic circumstances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The model creates an economic index by combining seven frequently updated economic indicators. These factors include the four major economic components that economists often use to date recessions: job growth (as measured by nonfarm payrolls), personal income, industrial production, and consumption. The fifth factor is inflation, as measured by changes in the Consumer Price Index. The sixth and seventh factors are more forward looking: the change in the S&amp;P 500 stock market index, and the consensus forecast of gross domestic product growth over the next two economic quarters, as taken from the median of The Wall Street Journal's monthly forecasting panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These variables were chosen because they provide for a broad consensus view of economic conditions, and because they are updated frequently, as opposed to other series, like gross domestic product, that are reported with long lag times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is essential to take a consensus of economic indicators because they often diverge - picking the wrong one could give you a misleading impression about the overall state of the economy and the election. For instance, industrial production has been quite strong, while personal income has been especially weak, and jobs growth has been all over the board in recent months. The consensus of indicators, however, points toward a decidedly below-average but not quite recessionary economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This economic index, which is scaled on a similar basis to gross domestic product and now reads at 2.2 percent, exerts a gravitational pull on the forecast. Right now, it suggests that the economy is in a state where the election &quot;should&quot; be very close. If Mr. Obama develops a large lead in the polls - without any underlying improvement in the economic fundamentals - it will therefore adjust his numbers downward. Likewise, if Mr. Romney were to build a clear lead in the polls, it would shave some of that advantage off, unless that came because of a deterioration in economic circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The model is designed such that this economic gravitational pull becomes less as the election draws nearer - until on Election Day itself, the forecast is based solely on the polls and no longer looks at economic factors. The track record of candidates who have polled strongly in June in defiance of the economic fundamentals is not so great, whereas if the same is true in September or October, it is much more plausible that the election will prove to be an exceptional case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the economy will exerts a fair amount of influence on the forecast for the time being. For instance, the poor jobs numbers that were released on Friday would have tangibly worsened Mr. Obama's forecast, while the nearly 300-point stock market rally on Wednesday would have improved it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to running a forecast of the Nov. 6 outcome, the model also reports a &quot;now-cast,&quot; which looks at the same information, and runs the same code, but assumes that the election is held today instead of in November. There may be times at which different candidates lead the forecast and the now-cast. For instance, the model will adjust polls conducted just after the party conventions, which typically produce short-lived &quot;bounces&quot; that soon fall back to earth. A candidate in the midst of a convention bounce might lead the now-cast but trail in the Nov. 6 forecast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from adding the economic component of the model, and introducing the now-cast, most of the other details of the model are similar to the version we ran in 2008. However, we have tightened the model's logic in some places, particularly in cases where ad hoc assumptions are replaced by more empirically driven guidance from our polling database. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, we found that &quot;fundamentals&quot; factors at the state level - particularly how it voted in the past two presidential elections - should be given more weight relative to the polls there than we had been assigning them in 2008. This means that in cases where polling in a state is sparse, the fundamentals analysis will tend to dominate. For instance, the model does not give much credence to the idea that Tennessee is close, even though a poll or two have shown it that way, since the volume of polling is not very high and since the fundamentals break sharply against Mr. Obama there. However, once a state gets a number of recent and reliable polls, the model will mostly trust the polling and the fundamentals analysis will matter less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As was the case in 2008, the model will adjust its forecast in each state even if there are no new polls there, based on the trend it discerns from polls in other states and at the national level. If, for instance, Mr. Obama goes through a period where his numbers have declined in Michigan and Pennsylvania, as well as in his national numbers, it would be na&iuml;ve to conclude that this standing has not also deteriorated in Ohio, even if there are no fresh surveys there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, one should be careful not overreact to new polls or other new information, particularly if they are unrelated to changes in fundamental circumstances of the race like economic conditions. One or two new polls are rarely the basis for a &quot;trend,&quot; and often even three, four or five new polls can be deceptive surprisingly often. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The model is fairly conservative about calculating the trend line at first, requiring a lot of evidence before it shifts the numbers much, but will become much more aggressive in the closing stages of the race. It also considers the fact that some states are inherently more sensitive to the national trend than others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any model is a simplification of the real world and requires making choices and assumptions. It therefore introduces the possibility of human error if the choices are the wrong ones. We would never suggest that you should look at our model alone at the expense of any other perspectives on the presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, we have thought about each of these choices and assumptions very carefully, and hope to explain them to you in much more detail in a series of posts over the rest of June. They are guided by an empirical outlook on past presidential races, including what we believe may be the world's most comprehensive database of past presidential polls. The choices are also guided by an overall philosophy toward model-building, some of which comes from the investigations I have undertaken about forecasting as part of my upcoming book. In general, our model is fairly simple in the way it projects the national numbers, essentially just relying on two variables (&quot;polls&quot; and &quot;economy&quot;). It gets more detailed in the way it evaluates data at the state level, since the states provide for 50 data points in each past election rather than just one, allowing for more robust analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The model will be updated several times a week at first, and then nearly every day once we reach the summer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women's groups on both sides of the political spectrum are reaping the benefit of the campaign-season focus on women's issues, and say they have the opposing side to thank for the windfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debates this year over contraception, federal funding for abortion services and Tuesday's Senate vote on equal pay for women have invigorated women's groups on the right and the left to try to sway the female vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Planned Parenthood has seen a steady increase in donations since Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation announced it would cut funding to the group for breast exams. Planned Parenthood raised $400,000 in the first 24 hours after the decision was announced. It was later reversed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Planned Parenthood endorsed President Obama and launched a $1.4 million ad buy in swing states attacking Republican Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Planned Parenthood Action Fund, a super PAC, has spent $1.6 million in independent expenditures this election cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women's issues have not been the political football that they have during this cycle,&quot; said Dawn Laguens, Planned Parenthood's executive vice president for policy, advocacy and communications. Obama's administration &quot;is the last line of defense&quot; for women's basic health care, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laguens said Planned Parenthood is on pace to raise much more than it did in 2008 and plans to keep women's issues front and center throughout the summer and fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EMILY's List, a fundraising group for female candidates who support abortion rights, has doubled it's membership since January 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY's List, said the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives spurred the group's growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our membership has gone from 400,000 when John Boehner became speaker to 1.5 million,&quot; she said. &quot;These debates over birth control, equal pay -- even the violence against women act -- the Republican Party has really been driving this and trying to move the clock backwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's super PAC, Women Vote!, has spent $443,755 since the beginning of the cycle on independent expenditures, according to the Federal Election Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, said the group is partnering with the American Association of University Women for a voter-mobilization project in 15 states. She said NOW saw an increase in fundraising and members after the Virginia Legislature passed a bill that would have required women to get a trans-vaginal ultrasound before having an abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What followed on the heels of the (Virginia bill) was the effort in the Senate to restrict birth control, and that's when the men started getting involved,&quot; O'Neill said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama leads Romney among women 49% to 43%, according to the most recent Gallup polling. But Romney has been narrowing the gap. In late March, Obama's lead with women was 52% to 40% over Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative groups such as the Susan B. Anthony List, Concerned Women for America and the National Federation of Republican Women said they have seen increases in their membership and fundraising coffers as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that supports candidates opposing abortion rights, said, &quot;What has been going on in the public conversation has attracted a lot of new women into the political arena, and none more than in the pro-life and the conservative moment because of the role Obama has taken on himself in speaking for women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added the group's fundraising is up one third from where they were at this point in the 2010 election cycle. The group has pledged to spend between $10 million and $12 million on Senate and presidential campaigns in important states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to endorsing Romney in April, Susan B. Anthony List spent $512,403 on independent expenditures in support of former senator Rick Santorum's campaign during the GOP primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2008 election cycle, the group's independent expenditures totaled around $114,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 1, Concerned Women for America launched a voter-registration program called &quot;She Votes&quot; and plans to spend $1 million on get-out-the-vote and voter-registration efforts. <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney rarely misses an opportunity to chastise President Obama for blaming the country's gloomy economic challenges on the situation he inherited from President George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What he's very good at is finding other people to blame,'' Mr. Romney said recently at a fund-raiser in San Diego. At an event in Michigan, he mocked Mr. Obama for trying to evade responsibility for the economy by blaming ''his predecessor, the Congress, the 1 percent, oil companies and A.T.M.'s.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was curious to hear Mr. Romney's own aides over the weekend respond to the Obama campaign's charges that their candidate had a failing record of creating jobs as governor of Massachusetts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's aides responded: It wasn't the governor's fault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He inherited a $3 billion projected deficit,'' Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, said on ''Fox News Sunday.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gillespie said it was unfair to judge Mr. Romney's record on job creation by including all four years of his tenure. He said the statistic that Mr. Romney was 47th in job creation during his time in office was calculated by ''diluting it with the first year in office, when he came into office, and it was 50th in job creation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essentially, Mr. Gillespie argued that Mr. Romney's first year, in 2003, shouldn't be counted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Fehrnstrom, another top aide to Mr. Romney, also blamed the situation that the governor inherited -- paradoxically, from Republican governors who occupied the Statehouse for the previous 12 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When Mitt Romney arrived, Massachusetts was an economic basket house,'' Mr. Fehrnstrom said on ABC's ''This Week'' program on Sunday. ''If you throw D.C. into the mix, we were 51 out of 51.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign responded harshly. On a conference call with reporters on Monday, David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the president's campaign, accused the Romney campaign of ''breathtaking hypocrisy'' for using the same methods to calculate job creation that it has been hammering the president for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Their answer to all of this was, 'Well, you really can't include his first year because you know he inherited a really tough economic situation,' '' Mr. Axelrod said. ''They've painted themselves into a corner here, and now that double standard is clear, and they're going to have to explain it to the American people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Mr. Romney's criticisms of Mr. Obama's economic record frequently focus on his first year in office. The Romney campaign says Mr. Obama has presided over an economy that has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs. In a recent news release, the Republican campaign said that ''Under President Obama, the Nation Has Lost 552,000 Jobs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that statistic includes Mr. Obama's first year in office, and especially the months of February, March and April, when monthly job losses from the economic collapse were at 700,000 or higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just leaving out February 2009 -- before any of Mr. Obama's policies, including the economic stimulus, had been put into place -- would wipe away all 552,000 lost jobs, giving the president a record of creating 172,000 jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. Romney's team were to ignore Mr. Obama's first year in office -- as Mr. Gillespie suggested should be done for Mr. Romney's first year as governor -- then the president would have added about 3.7 million jobs to the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign is unlikely to change its language or strategy. His bid for the White House depends on the idea that Mr. Obama has made the economy worse. Because the country has been adding jobs for nearly two years, Mr. Romney's argument depends on the steep job losses in Mr. Obama's first year in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the campaign may need to find a way to defend Mr. Romney's record as governor against the criticism that while he was in office, the state lagged behind the rest of the country in job creation. Mr. Obama's campaign is making that charge aggressively. Mr. Axelrod said on Monday that the campaign was spending about $10 million on a television advertisement that tries to undermine Mr. Romney's record as governor. The ad is running in nine battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs,'' the ad's narrator says. ''And fell to 47th in job creation. Fourth from the bottom.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns face the same conundrum: Their candidate governed in periods following economic slowdowns that weigh down the statistics that might otherwise look rosier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On ''Fox News Sunday,'' Mr. Fehrnstrom urged viewers to look at how Mr. Romney fared at the end of his term, when the economy had fired back up again. By that measure, he said, Massachusetts was not 47th in job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''By the time Mitt Romney left four years later, we were in the middle of the pack,'' Mr. Fehrnstrom said. ''We were 30th in the nation in terms of job growth. That's the trend line that you want to see.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Loss, JPMorgan Regulators in Spotlight &nbsp;|&nbsp; JPMorgan Chase's regulators will be in the Washington spotlight on Wednesday, when they testify before Congress on the bank's multibillion-dollar trading blunder and its implications for the future of Wall Street regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the bank's primary regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, will face particular scrutiny for its oversight of the JPMorgan unit responsible for a trading loss of more than $2 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JPMorgan disclosed the loss from its chief investment office last month. Just months earlier, top executives from the chief investment office had traveled to Washington to persuade the comptroller that new trading restrictions threatened the future of the bank. The executives argued that the so-called Volcker Rule could prevent the powerful unit from hedging risk throughout the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is important to maintaining the safety and soundness of JPMorgan,&quot; Ina R. Drew, then the head of the chief investment office, told comptroller officials, recalled one person who attended the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Drew was joined by five other JPMorgan executives who echoed her concerns about the Volcker Rule, saying the regulatory crackdown &quot;could restrict or cast in doubt strategies&quot; that the bank &quot;successfully employed during the financial crisis,&quot; according to a memorandum summarizing the meeting.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Europe falling deeper into crisis and Congress paralyzed, only one institution may have the flexibility to try to keep the U.S. economic recovery on track: the Federal Reserve.          But the Fed faces a daunting burden. Any new action could provoke tough political criticism. Republicans, in particular, have expressed deep concern about the measures taken by the Fed to support the economy - and could be doubly upset if new efforts goose the stock market and are perceived to work in favor of President Obama's reelection.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Fed is going to try to do the right thing,&quot; said Vincent Reinhart, a longtime Fed economist and now top U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. But, he added, &quot;The headline they most worry about is 'The Fed acts to help the incumbent.' &quot;The central bank fiercely guards its independence from politics. But its unprecedented efforts over the past four years - rescuing banks and printing trillions of dollars in new money to support the economy - have raised concerns among conservatives about a rising risk of runaway inflation and a weakened dollar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent months, amid improving economic data, the Fed sent signals that it was pausing its campaign of economic stimulus. But with the escalating crisis in Europe and the sudden slowdown in U.S. economic growth - marked by last week's report of paltry job growth - many economists say the Fed is likely to reconsider measures to support growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke could provide a hint of whether new stimulus is likely when he testifies before Congress on Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          The central bank could take a relatively modest step, such as a firm commitment to keep interest rates low for several years, or a much more dramatic one - for instance, printing hundreds of billions of dollars to purchase Treasury bonds and mortgage assets.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These steps could bring down interest rates, which already are at historic lows, to further support lending and economic activity. Yet the Fed's actions are not likely to be a panacea for the economy's ills - just as they haven't been in recent years - and couldn't fully insulate the economy from Europe's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're getting so close to the election. Rates are already at record lows. What are we trying to accomplish by lowering rates even further?&quot; said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. &quot;Republicans are going to say the Fed's trying to spike the punch bowl and help the Democrats out because we're getting closer to the election.&quot;             Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, argued that should the Fed act in the face of criticism, it will demonstrate its independence. &quot;People accuse the Fed of being political in so many ways, and the fact that the Fed does what it wants is what makes them independent,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          There is a long history of the Fed feeling political pressure - particularly from presidential candidates. Richard M. Nixon blamed his 1960 loss in part on the refusal of Fed Chairman William Martin Jr. to lower interest rates. When he became president, Nixon installed a Fed chair, Arthur Burns, who he believed would be vulnerable to pressure.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After losing the 1992 election amid a weak economy, President George H.W. Bush complained that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had refused to lower rates. &quot;I reappointed him, and he disappointed me,&quot; Bush famously remarked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernanke, appointed by President George W. Bush and reappointed by Obama, has faced more pressure from the political right than from the incumbent president. All of the candidates in the GOP primary this year said they would replace Bernanke as Fed chair. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With plans to step down in 18 months, Bernanke may not care much about any criticism leveled at him - but he does care about the Fed's ability to preserve its independence over the long term. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said he thinks additional efforts by the Fed to support economic growth would be unwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think we are looking for more,&quot; Romney said on CNBC. &quot;I think the right course is to have steadiness from the Fed, to maintain an effort to have a strong currency and a predictable currency.&quot;Many economists say the Fed did an able job of managing the financial crisis, but its performance in the years since has been a subject of debate. While Republicans have offered a broad critique, so, too, have several prominent economists on the left, such as Paul Krugman, who say the Fed has failed to address persistently high unemployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Fed veterans say the Fed is used to operating in a hothouse and won't be swayed by politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would guess that they'd prefer [to] stay out of the political debate if they could,&quot; said Don Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman. &quot;But they're already there, and at least in my experience the policy debate has always started and ended with what's the right thing to do to meet our legislative objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          But Reinhart, the former top Fed economist, said central bank officials must be worried about whether lawmakers in the next Congress will try again to more closely scrutinize their activities. One GOP lawmaker this year introduced a bill to strip the Fed of its charge to keep as many people employed as possible - in addition to ensuring stable prices.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside economists say the Fed will certainly act if the economy worsens signficantly. But if it is in a gray area, political considerations could make a difference. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it's close to a 50-50 call for the Fed on whether to act, I could see the political factor as something that could tip the balance to no action,&quot; said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight. &quot;But if it's a clear-cut case, as it would be if the euro-zone crisis worsened sharply, triggered perhaps by a Greek exit from the euro, then the Fed will act, regardless.&quot; goldfarbz@washpost.com</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">J</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">udging the wisdom of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's (I) ban on super-size sugary sodas depends on where you draw the line between nudge government and noodge government.          Nudge government makes sense. It harnesses human nature to steer citizens to smarter choices.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, higher prices reduce consumption, so government wisely taxes products it disfavors, such as tobacco. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But nudge government need not be nearly so directive. People take what they see first, so if schools set up cafeterias with the fruit and salad up front and the chocolate cake at the end of the line, they encourage children to eat healthier lunches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are inclined to stick with the status quo - to put it less politely, we're naturally lazy - so if retirement plans are structured to take effect automatically unless people opt out, workers will save more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such simple changes in &quot;choice architecture,&quot; as Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler write in &quot;Nudge,&quot; can &quot;move people in directions that will make their lives better.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noodge government is nudge government run amok. Noodge, from the Yiddish </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">nudyen</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to pester, is both noun and verb: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Stop noodging me. You are such a noodge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no bright-line test for the nudge/noodge divide. Noodging is like obscenity - except, with noodging, you know it when you feel it. But noodging is also like food allergies - the more you are exposed, the less tolerant you become, until the most minimal encounter can trigger a full-blown attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This last point helps explain the super-size reaction to Bloomberg's super-size edict: It arrives as the United States has become, for many people, the embodiment of Noodge Nation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">First they came for our incandescent light bulbs. Then they made us buy health insurance. Soon the compulsory broccoli-buying will commence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This response is both overwrought and ginned-up, as in the full-page ad that ran in the New York Times. &quot;The Nanny,&quot; blared the headline, over a Photoshopped image of Bloomberg as Mrs. Doubtfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nanny Bloomberg has taken his strange obsession with what you eat one step further,&quot; warns the ad, sponsored by the industry-funded Center for Consumer Freedom. &quot;What's next? Limits on the width of a pizza slice, size of a hamburger or amount of cream cheese on your bagel?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My initial reaction to Bloomberg's move was a big gulp - don't worry, Mr. Mayor, lower case - followed by ambivalent acceptance. Sugary drinks are not the only culprit in the obesity epidemic but, according to the Institute of Medicine, are the largest contributor of added calories to the American diet.           Other tactics could be more effective: a soda tax or barring the use of food stamps to buy sugary drinks. But Bloomberg's push for those approaches failed. So a limit on portion sizes could have a modest chilling effect without a huge downside. After all, no one who is determined to drink more than 16 ounces of Mountain Dew will be prevented from chugging away.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, it seemed like a nudge. But listen to Bloomberg, and you can hear the hectoring voice of the noodge. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bold actions to protect the public health always stir controversy at first,&quot; he asserted in USA Today. &quot;Smoke-free bars and restaurants, trans fat restriction and calorie posting in restaurants were all met with skepticism but are now widely popular in New York City.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Someday, the rest of you waddling dunderheads will appreciate my farsighted wisdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg's Mayor-Knows-Best paternalism feeds - pardon the pun - into a broader public anxiety about overbearing government. The bank and auto bailouts, the massive stimulus package, and sweeping new regulations of health care and the financial industry - all justified, by the way - have contributed to a public sense that the era of big government is back with a vengeance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new poll from the Pew Research Center found 62 percent agreeing that &quot;the federal government controls too much of our daily lives,&quot; up from 55 percent in 2009. Such chafing at government control, more than any rational objection, drives opposition to the individual mandate to obtain health insurance.           Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is cannily exploiting this fear of government as Leviathan. &quot;Under President Obama, bureaucrats are insinuating themselves into every corner of the economy,&quot; he warned the National Rifle Association in April.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg's intervention may be good for New Yorkers' waistlines, but it arrives at a particularly fraught moment: on the verge of the Supreme Court ruling on the health care mandate, in the midst of the election, and at a moment when the public may be tempted just to throw the noodges out.              </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ruthmarcus@washpost.com</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             FORT WORTH -              Mitt Romney brought his message directly to Hispanic voters Tuesday, promising that as president he would &quot;make sure this economy is good for all Americans, Hispanics and otherwise&quot; as he campaigned in heavily Hispanic Texas, the state that put him over the top in the delegate race for the Republican nomination.          The former Massachusetts governor lags behind President Obama in support from Hispanics, but he senses an opening around the economy. In his campaign stop here, Romney said the &quot;Obama economy&quot; has been &quot;particularly hard on Hispanic businesses and Hispanic Americans.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know that the rate of unemployment among Hispanic Americans rose last month to 11 percent? And that the people in this country that are poor, living in poverty, one out of three are Hispanic American?&quot; Romney said, speaking at Southwest Office Systems, a Hispanic-owned business. &quot;And among young Hispanic Americans the poverty rate is 30 percent? And Hispanic Americans in . . . large measure have looked to entrepreneurs and innovators and small business to get going, but this has been such an . . . anti-small-business, hostile-to-small-business environment that it's been harder for those businesses to open up their doors and to hire more people.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign released a Spanish-language ad on the Web called &quot;Dismal,&quot; citing similar statistics. The Obama campaign has launched television ads targeting Latinos in Colorado, Nevada and Florida that highlight the stimulus, the auto bailout and the health-care law, which polls show remains popular with that group.          Romney acknowledged last month at a private fundraiser that a big win for Obama among Latinos would &quot;spell doom&quot; for his party.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, Republicans made some inroads with Latinos, with President George W. Bush earning 44 percent of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But picking up that trend will be difficult for Romney, even given the economy, because &quot;softer&quot; issues such as personality and background could come into play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is going to face a lot of challenges, there is no question,&quot; said Matt Barreto, a political scientist at the University of Washington and co-founder of the independent polling firm Latino Decisions. &quot;Part of it is class and environment-based. Mitt Romney didn't grow up or serve in an area with a lot of Latinos, and that is a significant difference than Bush and McCain, and it's very obvious that he has an extremely shallow personal history with the Latino community. When he says that Latinos are hurting, so they will vote for him, there is actually a disconnect between his policy proposals and what Latinos actually support.&quot;The gap between Obama and Romney is significant: An NBC News-Wall Street Journal-Telemundo poll released in May shows Obama leading Romney by 61 percent to 27 percent among Latinos. And 35 percent of Latinos have a negative view of Romney, compared with 23 percent for Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Among Latino Republicans, there has been some disappointment that Romney hasn't reached out enough yet, according to Ana Navarro, who was the coordinator of Hispanic outreach for the 2008 presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he has room to grow. I do know that the Romney campaign understands the importance of the Latino vote, and so I think he does have to do more,&quot; said Navarro, who is based in Florida. &quot;We have to see more Hispanics as part of his senior staff. But I give him the benefit of the doubt and I recognize that the primary has been a resource-consuming effort.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary also provided Democrats with a highlight reel that will surely be replayed as the Obama campaign seeks to solidify its lead among Latinos by pointing to Romney's conservative comments on immigration and Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In running against Texas Gov. Rick Perry, whom many prominent Republicans viewed as having policies that could help Republicans attract Latino voters, Romney ran to the right, opposing the Dream Act, which would give young adults who were brought here as the children of illegal immigrants a pathway to residency status if they attended college or served in the military. Romney also spoke out against the nomination of Sotomayor, the first Latino on the Supreme Court, accusing her of judicial activism. Asked in an interview with Univision News last November what his strategy would be in drawing contrasts between his administration and a Republican nominee's positions, Obama suggested Democrats had plenty to work with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We may just run clips of the Republican debates verbatim,&quot; Obama said. &quot;We won't even comment on them, we'll just run those in a loop on Univision and Telemundo, and people can make up their own minds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Navarro said that Hispanics would vote overwhelmingly on the economy and that Romney should hammer away on the jobs issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has to stick to his mantra and say it's about the economy and Hispanics aren't stupid,&quot; Navarro said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WithEurope falling deeper into crisis and Congress paralyzed, only one institution may have the flexibility to try to keep the U.S. economic recovery on track: the Federal Reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Fed faces a daunting burden. Any new action could provoke tough political criticism. Republicans, in particular, have expressed deep concernabout the measures taken by the Fed to support the economy - and could be doubly upset if new efforts goose the stock market and are perceived to work in favor of President Obama's reelection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Fed is going to try to do the right thing,&quot; said Vincent Reinhart, a longtime Fed economist and now top U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. But, he added, &quot;The headline they most worry about is 'The Fed acts to help the incumbent.' &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central bank fiercely guards its independence from politics. But its unprecedented efforts over the past four years - rescuing banks and printing trillions of dollars in new money to support the economy - have raised concerns among conservatives about a rising risk of runaway inflation and a weakened dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent months, amid improving economic data, the Fed sent signals that it was pausing its campaign of economic stimulus. But with the escalating crisis in Europe and the sudden slowdown in U.S. economic growth - marked by last week's report of paltry job growth - many economists say the Fed is likely to reconsider measures to support growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernankecould provide a hint of whether new stimulus is likely when he testifies before Congress on Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central bank could take a relatively modest step, such as a firm commitment to keep interest rates low for several years, or a much more dramatic one - for instance, printing hundreds of billions of dollars to purchase Treasury bonds and mortgage assets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These steps could bring down interest rates, which already are at historic lows, to further support lending and economic activity. Yet the Fed's actions are not likely to be a panacea for the economy's ills - just as they haven't been in recent years - and couldn't fully insulate the economy from Europe's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're getting so close to the election. Rates are already at record lows. What are we trying to accomplish by lowering rates even further?&quot; said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. &quot;Republicans are going to say the Fed's trying to spike the punch bowl and help the Democrats out because we're getting closer to the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, argued that should the Fed act in the face of criticism, it will demonstrate its independence. &quot;People accuse the Fed of being political in so many ways, and the fact that the Fed does what it wants is what makes them independent,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a long history of the Fed feeling political pressure - particularly from presidential candidates. Richard M. Nixon blamed his 1960 loss in part on the refusal of Fed Chairman William Martin Jr. to lower interest rates. When he became president, Nixon installed a Fed chair, Arthur Burns, who he believed would be vulnerable to pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After losing the 1992 election amid a weak economy, President George H.W. Bush complained that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had refused to lower rates. &quot;I reappointed him, and he disappointed me,&quot; Bush famously remarked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernanke, appointed by President George W. Bush and reappointed by Obama, has faced more pressure from the political right than from the incumbent president. All of the candidates in the GOP primary this year said they would replace Bernanke as Fed chair. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With plans to step down in 18 months, Bernanke may not care much about any criticism leveled at him - but he does care about the Fed's ability to preserve its independence over the long term. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said he thinks additional efforts by the Fed to support economic growth would be unwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think we are looking for more,&quot; Romney said on CNBC. &quot;I think the right course is to have steadiness from the Fed, to maintain an effort to have a strong currency and a predictable currency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many economists say the Fed did an able job of managing the financial crisis, but its performance in the years since has been a subject of debate. While Republicans have offered a broad critique, so, too, have several prominent economists on the left, such as Paul Krugman, who say the Fed has failed to address persistently high unemployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Fed veterans say the Fed is used to operating in a hothouse and won't be swayed by politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would guess that they'd prefer [to] stay out of the political debate if they could,&quot; said Don Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman. &quot;But they're already there, and at least in my experience the policy debate has always started and ended with what's the right thing to do to meet our legislative objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Reinhart, the former top Fed economist, said central bank officials must be worried about whether lawmakers in the next Congress will try again to more closely scrutinize their activities. One GOP lawmaker this year introduced a bill to strip the Fed of its charge to keep as many people employed as possible - in addition to ensuring stable prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside economists say the Fed will certainly act if the economy worsens signficantly. But if it is in a gray area, political considerations could make a difference. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it's close to a 50-50 call for the Fed on whether to act, I could see the political factor as something that could tip the balance to no action,&quot; said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight. &quot;But if it's a clear-cut case, as it would be if the euro-zone crisis worsened sharply, triggered perhaps by a Greek exit from the euro, then the Fed will act, regardless.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judging the wisdom of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's (I) ban on super-size sugary sodas depends on where you draw the line between nudge government and noodge government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nudge government makes sense. It harnesses human nature to steer citizens to smarter choices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, higher prices reduce consumption, so government wisely taxes products it disfavors, such as tobacco. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But nudge government need not be nearly so directive. People take what they see first, so if schools set up cafeterias with the fruit and salad up front and the chocolate cake at the end of the line, they encourage children to eat healthier lunches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are inclined to stick with the status quo - to put it less politely, we're naturally lazy - so if retirement plans are structured to take effect automatically unless people opt out, workers will save more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such simple changes in &quot;choice architecture,&quot; as Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler write in &quot;Nudge,&quot; can &quot;move people in directions that will make their lives better.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noodge government is nudge government run amok. Noodge, from the Yiddish nudyen, to pester, is both noun and verb: Stop noodging me. You are such a noodge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no bright-line test for the nudge/noodge divide. Noodging is like obscenity - except, with noodging, you know it when you feel it. But noodging is also like food allergies - the more you are exposed, the less tolerant you become, until the most minimal encounter can trigger a full-blown attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This last point helps explain the super-size reaction to Bloomberg's super-size edict: It arrives as the United States has become, for many people, the embodiment of Noodge Nation. First they came for our incandescent light bulbs. Then they made us buy health insurance. Soon the compulsory broccoli-buying will commence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This response is both overwrought and ginned-up, as in the full-page ad that ran in the New York Times. &quot;The Nanny,&quot; blared the headline, over a Photoshopped image of Bloomberg as Mrs. Doubtfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nanny Bloomberg has taken his strange obsession with what you eat one step further,&quot; warns the ad, sponsored by the industry-funded Center for Consumer Freedom. &quot;What's next? Limits on the width of a pizza slice, size of a hamburger or amount of cream cheese on your bagel?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My initial reaction to Bloomberg's move was a big gulp - don't worry, Mr. Mayor, lower case - followed by ambivalent acceptance. Sugary drinks are not the only culprit in the obesity epidemic but, according to the Institute of Medicine, are the largest contributor of added calories to the American diet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other tactics could be more effective: a soda tax or barring the use of food stamps to buy sugary drinks. But Bloomberg's push for those approaches failed. So a limit on portion sizes could have a modest chilling effect without a huge downside. After all, no one who is determined to drink more than 16 ounces of Mountain Dew will be prevented from chugging away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, it seemed like a nudge. But listen to Bloomberg, and you can hear the hectoring voice of the noodge. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bold actions to protect the public health always stir controversy at first,&quot; he asserted in USA Today. &quot;Smoke-free bars and restaurants, trans fat restriction and calorie posting in restaurants were all met with skepticism but are now widely popular in New York City.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someday, the rest of you waddling dunderheads will appreciate my farsighted wisdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg's Mayor-Knows-Best paternalism feeds - pardon the pun - into a broader public anxiety about overbearing government. The bank and auto bailouts, the massive stimulus package, and sweeping new regulations of health care and the financial industry - all justified, by the way - have contributed to a public sense that the era of big government is back with a vengeance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new poll from the Pew Research Center found 62 percent agreeing that &quot;the federal government controls too much of our daily lives,&quot; up from 55 percent in 2009. Such chafing at government control, more than any rational objection, drives opposition to the individual mandate to obtain health insurance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is cannily exploiting this fear of government as Leviathan. &quot;Under President Obama, bureaucrats are insinuating themselves into every corner of the economy,&quot; he warned the National Rifle Association in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg's intervention may be good for New Yorkers' waistlines, but it arrives at a particularly fraught moment: on the verge of the Supreme Court ruling on the health care mandate, in the midst of the election, and at a moment when the public may be tempted just to throw the noodges out. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORT WORTH -Mitt Romney brought his message directly to Hispanic voters Tuesday, promising that as president he would &quot;make sure this economy is good for all Americans, Hispanics and otherwise&quot; as he campaigned in heavily Hispanic Texas, the state that put him over the top in the delegate race for the Republican nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Massachusetts governor lags behind President Obama in support from Hispanics, but he senses an opening around the economy. In his campaign stop here, Romney said the &quot;Obama economy&quot; has been &quot;particularly hard on Hispanic businesses and Hispanic Americans.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you know that the rate of unemployment among Hispanic Americans rose last month to 11 percent? And that the people in this country that are poor, living in poverty, one out of three are Hispanic American?&quot; Romney said, speaking at Southwest Office Systems, a Hispanic-owned business. &quot;And among young Hispanic Americans the poverty rate is 30 percent? And Hispanic Americans in . . . large measure have looked to entrepreneurs and innovators and small business to get going, but this has been such an . . . anti-small-business, hostile-to-small-business environment that it's been harder for those businesses to open up their doors and to hire more people.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign released a Spanish-language ad on the Web called &quot;Dismal,&quot; citing similar statistics. The Obama campaign has launched television ads targeting Latinos in Colorado, Nevada and Florida that highlight the stimulus, the auto bailout and the health-care law, which polls show remains popular with that group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney acknowledged last month at a private fundraiser that a big win for Obama among Latinos would &quot;spell doom&quot; for his party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, Republicans made some inroads with Latinos, with President George W. Bush earning 44 percent of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But picking up that trend will be difficult for Romney, even given the economy, because &quot;softer&quot; issues such as personality and background could come into play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is going to face a lot of challenges, there is no question,&quot; said Matt Barreto, a political scientist at the University of Washington and co-founder of the independent polling firm Latino Decisions. &quot;Part of it is class and environment-based. Mitt Romney didn't grow up or serve in an area with a lot of Latinos, and that is a significant difference than Bush and McCain, and it's very obvious that he has an extremely shallow personal history with the Latino community. When he says that Latinos are hurting, so they will vote for him, there is actually a disconnect between his policy proposals and what Latinos actually support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gap between Obama and Romney is significant: An NBC News-Wall Street Journal-Telemundo poll released in Mayshows Obama leading Romney by 61 percent to 27 percent among Latinos. And 35 percent of Latinos have a negative view of Romney, compared with 23 percent for Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Latino Republicans, there has been some disappointment that Romney hasn't reached out enough yet, according to Ana Navarro, who was the coordinator of Hispanic outreach for the 2008 presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Navarro said that Hispanics would vote overwhelmingly on the economy and that Romney should hammer away on the jobs issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has to stick to his mantra and say it's about the economy and Hispanics aren't stupid,&quot; Navarro said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's campaign ratcheted up its assault on Mitt Romney's record as governor of Massachusetts on Monday, putting $10 million behind a tough new commercial that claims Mr. Romney had ''one of the worst economic records in the country.'' The advertisement will be broadcast in nine battleground states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE SCRIPT The ad opens with the words ''September 2002'' and an announcer's voice: ''It started like this.'' Mr. Romney is shown at a debate where he says: ''I speak the language of business. I know how jobs are created.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcer narrates over images that suggest economic ruin: a vacant, dust-covered factory floor, an empty office, a pair of discarded work gloves. ''But it ended like this: One of the worst economic records in the country. When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs -- a rate twice the national average -- and fell to 47th in job creation, fourth from the bottom. Instead of hiring workers from his own state, Romney outsourced call-center jobs to India.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next image on screen: a photo of Mr. Romney boarding a jet. ''He cut taxes for millionaires like himself while raising them on the middle class and left the state $2.6 billion deeper in debt. So now, when Mitt Romney talks about what he'd do as president, remember, we've heard it all before.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clip of Mr. Romney at the debate is shown again. ''I know how jobs are created.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcer concludes: ''Romney economics. It didn't work then, and it won't work now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCURACY The Romney campaign has not challenged some of the ad's key facts, including Massachusetts's standing as 47th in the nation in job creation, its loss of 40,000 manufacturing jobs and the outsourcing of some jobs to India. Mr. Romney's record on jobs, like Mr. Obama's, is mixed. When Mr. Romney took office, the state's unemployment rate was 5.6 percent. When he left, it was 4.7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's debt rose under his leadership as it borrowed to meet short-term cash-flow needs, among other things. But he left Massachusetts with a rainy day fund of $2 billion. Mr. Romney did not, as the ad suggests, raise taxes broadly on the middle class and cut them for the wealthy. He did support fee increases -- on everything from playing golf on state courses to filing a discrimination complaint. While he pushed for a capital gains tax refund that benefited the wealthy, people of more modest means benefited, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE BOTTOM LINE The ad represents a shift in the president's efforts to assail his rival's strongest credential: his economic expertise. Notably, the ad makes no mention of Mr. Romney's career as a businessman, a line of attack that drew considerable backlash among some high-profile Obama supporters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mitt Romney wants to lop off a year from his economic record as governor of Massachusetts -- but not from President Obama's.&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there's one thing Mitt Romney cannot stand, it's when President Obama blames the economic situation he inherited from former president George W. Bush for the country's current gloomy challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What he's very good at is finding other people to blame,&quot; Mr. Romney said at a fund-raiser in San Diego recently. At an event in Michigan, he mocked Mr. Obama for trying to evade responsibility for the economy by blaming &quot;his predecessor, the Congress, the one&nbsp; percent, oil companies, and A.T.M.s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was interesting to hear Mr. Romney's own aides over the weekend try to explain some of the less flattering statistics from Mr. Romney's time as governor of Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He inherited a $3-billion projected deficit,&quot; Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, explained on Fox News Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gillespie said it was unfair to judge Mr. Romney's record on job creation by including all four years of his tenure. He said the statistic that Mr. Romney was 47th in job creation during his time in office was calculated by &quot;diluting it with the first year in office,&nbsp; when he came into office, and it was 50th in job creation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essentially, he was arguing that Mr. Romney's first year, in 2003, shouldn't be counted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Fehrnstrom, another top aide to Mr. Romney, also blamed the situation that the governor inherited - paradoxically, from Republican governors who occupied the Statehouse for the previous 12 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Mitt Romney arrived, Massachusetts was an economic basket house,&quot; Mr. Fehrnstrom said on ABC's &quot;This Week&quot; program on Sunday. &quot;If you throw D.C. into the mix, we were 51 out of 51.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's team was incredulous. On a conference call with reporters, David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the president's campaign, accused Mr. Romney's campaign of &quot;breathtaking hypocrisy&quot; for using the same excuse that their candidate has been hammering the president for. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their answer to all of this was. 'Well you really can't include his first year because you know he inherited a really tough economic situation,' &quot; Mr. Axelrod said. &quot;They've painted themselves into a corner here. And now that double standard is clear and they're going to have to explain it to the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the most serious attacks from Mr. Romney involve exactly the kind of focus on Mr. Obama's first year in office that the Republican advisers were trying to avoid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney frequently says that Mr. Obama has presided over an economy that has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs. In a recent news release, the Republican campaign said,&nbsp; &quot;Under President Obama, the nation has lost 552,000 jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that statistic includes Mr. Obama's first year in office, and especially the months of February, March and April, when monthly job losses from the economic collapse were at 700,000 or higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just ignoring February of 2009, before any of Mr. Obama's policies - including the economic stimulus - had been put into place, would wipe away all 552,000 lost jobs, giving the president a record of creating 172,000 jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. Romney's team were to ignore Mr. Obama's first year in office - as Mr. Gillespie suggested should be done for Mr. Romney's first year as governor - then the president would have added about 3.7 million jobs to the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, Mr. Romney's campaign is unlikely to change its rhetoric or strategy. His bid for the White House depends on the idea that Mr. Obama has made the economy worse. Because the country has been adding jobs for nearly two years, Mr. Romney's argument depends on the steep job losses in Mr. Obama's first year in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the campaign does need to find a way to defend Mr. Romney's record as governor against the criticism that the state lagged behind the rest of the country in job creation while he was in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign is making that charge aggressively. Mr. Axelrod said on Monday that the campaign is spending about $10 million on a television ad that tries to undermine Mr. Romney's gubernatorial record. The ad is running in nine battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs,&quot; the narrator in the ad says. &quot;And fell to<BR>47th in job creation. Fourth from the bottom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns face the same conundrum: their candidate governed in periods following economic slowdowns that weigh down the statistics that might otherwise look rosier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Fox News Sunday, Mr. Fehrnstrom urged viewers to look at how Mr. Romney fared at the end of his term, when the economy had fired back up again. By that measure, he said, Massachusetts was not 47th in job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the time Mitt Romney left four years later, we were in the middle of the pack,&quot; Mr. Fehrnstrom said. &quot;We were 30th in the nation in terms of job growth. That's the trend line that you want to see.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Scott Walker claimed victory just after 11:30 p.m. Tuesday night, thanking God and his supporters, and saying that it is time to move on with the business of governing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, we tell Wisconsin, we tell our country, and we tell people all around the globe that voters really do want leaders who stand up and make the tough decisions,&quot; Mr. Walker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to a raucous crowd of supporters, Mr. Walker said that he would meet with his cabinet on Wednesday to continue working on behalf of the state's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll renew our commitment to help small businesses grow jobs in the state,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And after more than a year of political battle in which his push for limits to collective bargaining rights led to a historic recall effort, Mr. Walker called for people in his state to work together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tomorrow is the day after the election,&quot; he said. &quot;And tomorrow, we are no longer opponents. Tomorrow, we are one as Wisconsinites.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Barrett, the mayor of Milwaukee, conceded the recall race for governor but said &quot;this is not an end tonight&quot; and said Wisconsin remains a divided state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are more chapters to come,&quot; Mr. Barrett said, speaking just after 11 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In those chapters, it is my sincere hope that all of us here will remain engaged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Barrett spoke briefly to his subdued supporters after calling Mr. Walker to congratulate him, the second time in four years that he had to make that call. Mr. Walker defeated Mr. Barrett two years ago to win the governorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To those of you who care about this city,&quot; Mr. Barrett said, &quot;remain engaged, remain involved, because we will continue to fight for justice and fairness in this city and this state.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10:05 P.M. | Walker Survives Recall Vote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott Walker, the embattled Republican governor of Wisconsin, survived a recall vote on Tuesday, based on early returns and exit polls, defeating a union-led effort to remove him from office for pushing laws to restrict the collective bargaining rights of state workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's labor movement had marshaled widespread anger earlier this year to force a recall vote just two years into Mr. Walker's four-year term. Democrats collected close to one million signatures in the petition drive to oust him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That effort led to the closely-watched rematch between Mr. Walker and the Democratic opponent he beat in 2010, Tom Barrett, the mayor of Milwaukee. In the voting Tuesday, Mr. Walker once again bested Mr. Barrett for the state's top job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results were a victory for the national Republican Party and conservative groups from around the country, which had rallied behind Mr. Walker with tens of millions of dollars. Mr. Walker will now complete his term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they were a blow to the labor movement and Democrats, who had sought to link Mr. Walker to a conservative movement that they said is hostile to workers rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the red-hot frustration among workers that led to the recall appeared to subside over recent months as the race between Mr. Walker and Mr. Barrett became less about unions and more about the general economic mood of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger, campaigned for their party nominee in Wisconsin in the final weeks, prompting speculation that neither wanted to assume the risks of a loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign in Wisconsin, coming just five months before the presidential election, was being watched by both sides as potential evidence of how voters are feeling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's unclear that Mr. Walker's victory will translate into a clear benefit for Mr. Romney in the fall. Wisconsin voters said in early exit polls that they would vote to re-elect Mr. Obama to the White House if the voting were taking place today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also bested Mr. Romney on the question of who would do a better job of improving the economy. And the president did better among the Wisconsin voters on the question of who could do a better job of helping the middle class, according to the survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may reflect a queasiness with recall elections. A large majority of the voters who turned out on Tuesday said recall elections are only appropriate when incumbents are accused of official misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9:53 P.M. | Exit Polls: Support for Recall </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While turnout has been reported to be high, a majority of voters on Tuesday may not have been entirely supportive of the recall election at all. Nearly 6 in 10 Wisconsin voters said that recall elections were only appropriate for official misconduct, and another 1 in 10 said they were never appropriate, according to early exit poll results. About 3 in 10 voters said recall elections were appropriate for any reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who support recall elections for any reason overwhelmingly expressed support for Tom Barrett, while those who said recalls were never appropriate backed Gov. Scott Walker. Among those who said official misconduct was appropriate to prompt a recall, about two-thirds supported Mr. Walker, while nearly a third supported Mr. Barrett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats, younger voters, union households and those with post-graduate degrees were more likely to say that recalls are appropriate for any reason; Republicans, Tea Party supporters and those who approved of Mr. Walker's handling of collective bargaining were more likely to say recalls should only be held for official misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9:38 P.M. | Close Race Could Mean Recount; Absentee Ballots Remain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extremely close race between Scott Walker and Tom Barrett has raised the prospect that a recount might be requested to determine the winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wisconsin election law does not provide for an automatic recount to be set off by a close race. Instead, it allows either of the candidates to request a recount if they think it could affect the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the difference between the two candidates is .5 percent or less, the state would pay for a recount. If the difference is from .5 percent to 2 percent, the candidate requesting must pay $5 per ward to recount the votes. Candidates must pay the entire cost of a recount if the difference is more than 2 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the question of a recount may be difficult to determine Tuesday night because of the state's rules involving absentee ballots. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deadline for returning a filled-out absentee ballot in person was Tuesday. But absentee ballots are also accepted by mail until this Friday as long as they were postmarked by Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an extremely close race, a significant number of mailed-in absentee ballots could affect whether the candidate or the state would have to pay for a recount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by WTAQ, a news radio station in Madison, Wis., on Monday said that at least 206,000 absentee ballots were returned by the time early voting ended last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recount in the race would add to the historic nature of the battle in Wisconsin. Mr. Walker is only the third governor to face a recall in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both political parties and their allies would likely descend on Wisconsin for the legal battle over counting the ballots. The fight over the recount would be reminiscent of the 2000 recount effort in Florida.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9:00 P.M. | Exit Polls Show Extremely Close Race as Voting Ends</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The polls have closed in Wisconsin, where early exit poll returns show a very tight race between Scott Walker, the embattled Republican governor, and his Democratic challenger, Tom Barrett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor unions, which had pushed to recall Mr. Walker in the wake of his efforts to curtail collective bargaining rights for state workers, appear to have succeeded in bolstering turnout among union households.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preliminary exit poll returns showed that about a third of voters said someone in their household belonged to a union. That is higher than in 2010, when Mr. Walker beat Mr. Barrett to win the governor's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats were counting on higher turnout, and especially higher turnout among union supporters, to help win the recall and install Mr. Barrett in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans from across the country poured money into Mr. Walker's campaign to stop that from happening. But most voters on Tuesday - about 9 out of 10 - told exit pollsters that they had already made up their minds before May 1, when the millions in Republican money fueled a blitz of political television commercials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A victory by Mr. Barrett would be a surprise. Virtually every poll in recent weeks showed Mr. Walker leading in his bid to stay in office. National Democrats are hoping that a victory in the state would signal that voters are rejecting Mr. Walker's conservative approach to the country's economic problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are betting that a victory by Mr. Walker would be an indication that Mitt Romney could win Wisconsin in the fall. President Obama won the state in 2008, and it has been a reliably Democratic state in presidential elections for several cycles before that.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8:53 P.M. | Recall Results Unlikely to Reveal Much About November</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results of the recall election in Wisconsin on Tuesday night may tell us something about the future of the labor movement and the salience of collective bargaining rights as an issue to swing voters. A win by Gov. Scott Walker, who is ahead in the polls, might make other Republican governors who have sought to pare collective bargaining, like John Kasich of Ohio, breathe a little easier when they come up for election again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one thing that the recall is unlikely to do is tell us much about how the presidential contest in Wisconsin is likely to evolve in November. The politics for a governor's campaign are often subject to different currents than presidential ones, and historically the party identification of a state's governor has said little about how presidential candidates will fare there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past 40 years, in fact, the relationship has run in the reverse direction than you might expect. The Democratic presidential candidate has typically done a little better when the state's governor is a Republican, and vice versa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's been a lot made in recent days about how President Obama declined to come to Wisconsin on behalf of Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee. For that matter, Mitt Romney didn't campaign for Gov. Scott Walker, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But their absence doesn't mean that the Republicans and Democrats haven't been active in Wisconsin. The Republicans have funneled more money into the state, but officials from the two parties have been working for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a rundown of what the two national parties have been up to in the Badger State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REPUBLICANS: The party has been active in Wisconsin since January, working with state officials to run the ground operation, which includes 26 offices across the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican officials say the party operation made more than four million volunteer voter contacts in that time, essentially knocking on doors and making phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national party also provided voter data from its databases and ran Mr. Walker's absentee voter program. Republican officials say that by Election Day, more ballots had already been cast in Republican-leaning counties than in Democratic ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Walker's fund-raising prowess, much of it from out-of-state, was helped by the use of the national party's &quot;phone from home&quot; application, which allows supporters to raise money on his behalf from anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEMOCRATS: The party, in conjunction with Obama for America, the president's campaign operation, is operating more than 40 offices across Wisconsin, with a total paid staff of 100 people, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Democratic officials said the party has supported extensive voter registration efforts during the past six months and is helping to manage &quot;voter protection&quot; efforts to make sure legitimate voters can cast their ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party has deployed its online resources for Mr. Barrett, providing support for fund-raising. And staff members for the Democratic National Committee helped organize rallies and knocked on doors, officials said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORT ATKINSON, Wis. - Some voters across the state are seeing dollar signs as they step into the ballot box on Tuesday. Not just because of estimates that campaigns and outside groups have spent more than $60 million on the recall fight between Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, and Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee, a Democrat. There's also as much as $18 million it was expected to cost counties, municipalities and the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a waste,&quot; said Dale Huffstutler, 65, an accountant here who planned to back Mr. Walker on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it was about retaliation,&quot; Mr. Huffstutler said on Monday. &quot;No one is really dealing with the issues. They're not doing what's best for the state. They're doing what best for themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farther south, in Janesville, Pam Fischer, 45, supported Mr. Barrett on Tuesday because she said Mr. Walker, for whom she voted in 2010, &quot;pulled the rug out from under&quot; public employees and school districts. Ms. Fischer, an adult education instructor at Blackhawk Technical College, said that the money Wisconsin has spent on the recall election was unfortunate, but a necessary expense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the grand scheme of things, we're setting a national precedent,&quot; she said. &quot;All eyes are on us. If the rights of our students and the rights of our middle class are maintained, then it will all be worth it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others have raised concerns about big spending from candidates and outside groups, which nearly doubled what it was when Mr. Barrett and Mr. Walker faced off in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Barrett has raised about $4 million in contributions. A law that allowed Mr. Walker to raise unlimited amounts before the recall election was officially announced, which did not happen until late March, helped him take in more than $30 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's staggering how much the rest of the country is interested in this election,&quot; said Dave Jacobs, 56, a supporter of Mr. Barrett from Whitewater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jacobs, a state employee who plows roads in Walworth County, said he has felt the effects of Mr. Walker's changes to public employee bargaining rights last year, which ultimately led to the recall election on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, he and many voters across the state, including those who support Mr. Barrett, said Wisconsin needs to rethink its recall law, admitting that the effort to oust Mr. Walker (and all that it has cost) is not a sustainable approach to dealing with political problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the beginning of recall-itis,&quot; Mr. Jacobs said. &quot;We can't keep doing this forever. As long as the tool is there, we're going to use it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JANESVILLE, Wis. - For many Wisconsin voters, the polarization caused by the recall election against Gov. Scott Walker is palpable. Stories abound about family members and friends turning into political foes. Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee, who is running to replace Mr. Walker, has called it Wisconsin's &quot;civil war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be nice when it's settled,&quot; said Pat Muller, 71, who was one of about 20 residents waiting in front of the Rotary Botanical Gardens here for voting to start early Tuesday morning. &quot;I wish everybody could get along.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some neighbors in the line whispered passionately about the candidate for whom they would vote, stepping away from the crowd so as not to be heard by those around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Weber, 53, a fifth-grade schoolteacher in Janesville who backed Mr. Barrett, said the vote would be a defining moment in the state's history. She said that given some time, Wisconsin might be able to move on. &quot;We'll be a stronger state because of this,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But interviews with voters across the state in recent days, including those who supported Mr. Barrett, suggest that few expect a swift return to the civil political climate that they once knew, regardless of who wins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what kind of leader it will take to heal the state right now,&quot; said Joyce Kupres, 58, as she ate dinner at a sidewalk cafe in Whitewater on Monday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters in Tuesday's recall election are somewhat more opposed to the Tea Party movement than voters in 2010 were, but most nonetheless say, as in 2010, that government &quot;is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 4 in 10 voters in preliminary exit polls say they support the Tea Party movement, about as many oppose it, and a quarter are neutral. While support for the political movement has held steady from two years ago, opposition is up somewhat from 2010, according to these results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But voters' antipathy toward increased government involvement in 2010 is echoed in Tuesday's results. Two years ago, 41 percent said government &quot;should do more to solve problems,&quot; while 56 percent said it was doing too many things better left to others. Voters on Tuesday felt similarly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau provided some insight into what types of people tend to vote (or not) in U.S. elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it happens, the data also offered an interesting look at several general election voter-turnout trends in Wisconsin that might have played out, to some extent, in Tuesday's recall election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with voters nationwide, Wisconsin's voters trend older: in 2010, during the state's last gubernatorial contest, just 24 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 24 turned out, compared with 72 percent of voters 65 and older. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as women are more likely to vote nationwide, they are also more likely than men to vote in Wisconsin. And just as we see nationally, the most-educated Wisconsinites have a higher rate of participation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race has not been a predictor of voter turnout in Wisconsin, though it tends to be for the United States population at large. In 2010, voting rates for white, black and Hispanic voters in Wisconsin were, statistically, about the same. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, Wisconsinites are much more likely to vote than the average American. In 2008, more than 71 percent of registered voters in Wisconsin cast their ballots, a percentage bested that November by only Minnesota and the District of Columbia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnout for Wisconsin's recall election likely won't rival that of a presidential race, but Wisconsin voters can be counted on to show up at the polls in force. Before Tuesday's vote, the state's Government Accountability Board predicted turnout at 60 percent to 65 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's reason to be confident in that estimate. Two years ago, when the same gubernatorial candidates faced each other at the top of the ticket, the board made a similar prediction that came incredibly close: after projecting that 2.18 million Wisconsinites would vote, or about 50 percent of registered voters, more than 2.16 million ultimately showed up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6:51 P.M. | Exit Polls: Did Money Talk?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The millions of dollars spent in recent weeks by both political parties for advertising, campaign signs and get-out-the-vote efforts may not actually have changed anyone's mind about whom to vote for in Tuesday's recall election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to early results from surveys of voters leaving the polls on Tuesday, nearly 9 out of 10 Wisconsin voters said their minds were made up about whom to vote for before May 1. Whether all that money results in larger turnout for either of the candidates remains to be seen until vote counts are in after the polls close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Wisconsin voters indicated that they were satisfied with their respective candidates on Tuesday. Nearly three-quarters of voters said their vote on Tuesday was cast mainly for their candidate. About a quarter said their vote was mainly against their candidate's opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the extra campaign in the middle of an election year has done little to sway anyone's thoughts about the two political parties. Half of voters said they had an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party, and half said the same about the Republican Party - sentiments that are relatively unchanged from two years ago, according to the 2010 exit poll results.</SPAN></P>

Kennedy used the restroom), is as good a judge of voter sentiment as you can find around here. Mr. Danielson, with a gray ponytail and a Hawaiian shirt, said voters in Washburn County, in the northwestern part of the state, were &quot;pretty well split.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was here early last year that tens of thousands of protesters flooded the square around the Capitol to express their outrage over Gov. Scott Walker's changes to collective bargaining rights for most state employees. Now, with voters across Wisconsin going to the polls on Tuesday to decide if Mr. Walker will keep his job, many residents of Madison, a Democrat stronghold, said all they could do was wait for the results - and pester as many people as possible to vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tasha McShan, 31, a hair stylist in Madison, said before 10 a.m., she had already been stopped by three strangers asking her if she had cast her ballot yet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I going to put my sticker on, so people stop bothering me,&quot; Ms. McShan said as she walked out from under the red awning of a local senior center where she voted for Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She remembers watching the huge demonstrations last year from her downtown fourth-floor apartment, how they kept her infant son awake in the middle of the night, and said she predicted that protesters might return if Mr. Walker stays in office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he wins, there's going to be a lot more,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up the street, on the lawn of the Capitol, a couple of hundred people gathered for an Election Day &quot;Solidarity Singalong,&quot; a musical protest gathering with anti-Walker renditions of songs like &quot;This Land Is Your Land.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group played a hodgepodge of instruments - horns, guitars, drums, an accordion, a banjo - and has gathered every weekday since March 2011. Tuesday, their 383rd day, was more lively than most, some said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's celebratory and nerve-wracking,&quot; said Chris Reeder, 41, one of the organizers, about the mood of the city. &quot;We're excited about what could happen, and we're terrified about what could happen. We're coming together, standing together in our terror and our hope and holding each other close.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in the audience have walked door-to-door canvassing against Mr. Walker in recent weeks and had been on the front lines of a recall petition effort this year that netted more than 900,000 signatures - almost double the amount needed to hold the election.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters plan to gather again Tuesday night at 8 p.m. Central, when polls close, for more singing and a vigil, before attending local result-watching parties in the city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point on Tuesday afternoon, some of them boarded a painted school bus that did &quot;victory laps&quot; around the Capitol, despite some public polls that show Mr. Walker ahead of Mr. Barrett (the lead has generally been within the margin of error for each poll). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many here dispute those numbers, saying they expect news of an upset late Tuesday night. Other Barrett supporters have said that, win or lose, the recall sends a clear message to politicians nationwide.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminary exit poll results indicate an uptick in turnout among voters from union households - something Democrats were hoping for in their effort to oust Gov. Scott Walker on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whether that holds as voters continue to head to the polls, and whether it is enough to give Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee the edge, are open questions at this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a third of voters in preliminary exit poll results say they or someone in their household belong to a labor union. That is an increase from 2010 and 2008, when 26 percent of voters in each of those elections were from a union household.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High union turnout is crucial for the Democrats. In 2010, 63 percent of voters in union households supported Mr. Barrett, compared with 37 percent for Mr. Walker. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue that has the unions fired up - the changes in state law that limited collective bargaining rights for most of the state's public workers - voters are closely divided, with about as many approving of it as disapproving. Voters in Tuesday's recall election are also closely split in their views of how Mr. Walker handled the issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the fact that Wisconsin voters tilted toward Mr. Obama does not necessarily mean that Tom Barrett will emerge victorious. Polling in recent weeks has shown Gov. Scott Walker leading even as voters said they preferred keeping Mr. Obama in office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Election officials expected a high turnout at the polls on Tuesday - about 60 percent to 65 percent of registered voters. Early Tuesday morning, lines were reported outside voting sites across the state. According to a recent poll by Marquette University Law School taken in late May, only 3 percent of 600 likely voters were unable to give an opinion about Gov. Scott Walker, compared to 11 percent who could not do the same about his opponent, Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Chris Trent, 26, who moved to Whitewater five months ago, said he was not even aware that there was a recall election going on, let alone who the candidates were or why it was happening. &quot;I have no idea what's going on,&quot; he said. &quot;I really don't follow politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Milton, about 15 miles away, Hayley Willard, 19, said she had heard plenty of people talking about the recall, but has not paid much attention. &quot;People are going to live however they want to live no matter who is in charge,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5:57 P.M. | Exit Polls: Voters Split Over Walker's Jobs Record</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wisconsin recall voters are divided over whether Mr. Walker has done a good job of growing the state's economy, according to preliminary exit poll results released Tuesday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About half said they approved of how he has handled creating jobs in the state, and about half said they disapproved. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been some debate in the last week concerning Mr. Walker's early release of state jobs data before the election, which would not have been made public by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics until later in June, after the election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the bureau's data, Wisconsin's unemployment rate was 6.7 percent for April 2012, well below the 8.2 percent unemployment rate nationwide. And the state's unemployment is down from its 7.6 percent unemployment rate in November 2010, when Mr. Walker was elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5:51 P.M. | Turnout Is Expected to Be Critical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every election, you hear the same thing: it's all about turnout. That might actually be true in Wisconsin on Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those on the ground in the Badger State are predicting that turnout will be around 2.5 million voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would be higher than the 2.1 million who turned out in 2010, when Scott Walker, a Republican, won the governorship. But fewer than the 2.9 million who showed up in 2008, when President Obama won the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is whether actual turnout is closer to the 2.1 million or the 2.9 million. The logic appears to be that a smaller turnout benefits Mr. Walker, while a surge of voters helps Tom Barrett, his Democratic challenger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why? If the turnout is big, that suggests that unions have managed to motivate their supporters to turn out at the polls. Those would likely be Barrett supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But such calculations are a guess, at best. Republicans say their turnout efforts are better than ever, so a big turnout might be somewhat deceiving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5:39 P.M. | Voters Turn Out for Recall Vote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MILWAUKEE - Sixteen months after Wisconsin erupted into one of the fiercest political wars in residents' memories, voters began streaming into polling places on Tuesday to decide whether to remove Gov. Scott Walker, the Republican whose decision to cut collective bargaining rights for most public workers set off the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Walker, who cast his own vote at a school in this city's suburbs not long after the polls opened, is only the third governor in the nation's history to face a recall election. Under Wisconsin's provisions for recall - never before tested when it comes to a governor - Mr. Walker finds himself competing for his job against Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee, the Democratic challenger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the outcome will decide Mr. Walker's immediate political future, it will also be looked to as a sign about how this state will approach fiscal and other policies in the months ahead, how comfortable other states' leaders will feel challenging collective bargaining rights and unions, and about President Obama's chances come November in a state that he won four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many cities, lines were reported at polling places, even before they opened at 7 a.m. In Janesville, not far from the Illinois border, about 20 residents waited among a landscape of ferns and flowers in front of the Rotary Botanical Gardens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to be a big one today,&quot; said Lois Altmann, 83, a volunteer poll worker, as she taped maps of the county on walls inside the garden's visitor center where voting booths were being erected. &quot;Soon we can stop hearing about this.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama dined last month with 150 guests at George Clooney's California cottage. He exchanged quips in January with Spike Lee in the director's New York City townhouse.           Last fall, Obama entertained megastar Lady Gaga, who was seated in the front row of a Silicon Valley fundraiser in six-inch heels and a towering blond bouffant.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's popularity with Hollywood glitterati is again on display as his campaign mobilizes its vast fundraising apparatus to amass cash in a campaign that is shaping up to be the most expensive in U.S. history. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Obama was the candidate of cool in 2008, when celebrities such as musician Will.I.Am produced viral campaign videos             , he has even more aggressively employed star power to open pocketbooks, build buzz and, perhaps most notably, deploy celebrities to target specific constituencies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Obama's glamorous elbow-rubbing carries significant risks as he struggles to convince voters that he is focused single-mindedly on their economic concerns. And it is  triggering attacks from his Republican rivals, who contend that the president is more interested in hobnobbing with Hollywood to help his campaign than he is in helping ordinary Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the Republican National Committee released a Web video called &quot;Meanwhile,&quot; which flashes unemployment numbers for various groups - women, Latinos, African Americans, youth - under clips from an Obama campaign video from last Friday of Vogue Editor Anna Wintour talking about hanging out with &quot;Sex and the City&quot; star Sarah Jessica Parker and first lady Michelle Obama. The bustling sounds of New York City streets give way to crickets chirping at the end of the RNC version, along with the tag line: &quot;Obama's focused on keeping his job. But what about yours?&quot;           Although Obama faced similar accusations in 2008, the charges are potentially more dangerous this time given that he is a sitting president responsible for managing the economy, rather than being just one of 100 senators. Yet the Obama campaign sees Hollywood as a powerful and necessary ally, able to both raise large amounts of money and also speak directly to important subgroups of voters who identify with the famous. On Monday, as his celebrity ties became an issue, Obama hosted rock star Jon Bon Jovi on Air Force One on the way to fundraisers in New York.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fundraiser with Wintour and Parker, for example, is part of an effort to appeal to women; the reelection team next week is offering supporters a chance to win a raffle (entry fee $3) to attend the New York City event. In a fundraising e-mail to supporters Monday, Michelle Obama called Parker &quot;a loving mom, an incredibly hard worker, and a great role model&quot; and added: &quot;She's one of those people you can't help but admire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC response video mocked the timing of the Obama video's release. The video &quot;highlights how out of touch President Obama and his campaign are after releasing a glitzy fundraising video featuring Vogue chief Anna Wintour the same day as a dismal jobs report,&quot; RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said, referring to a Labor Department report that showed the economy added just 69,000 jobs in May.          The Obama campaign struck back quickly, pointing out that Romney appeared last week with developer Donald Trump, host of the television show &quot;The Apprentice.&quot; Trump's controversial comments questioning Obama's birthplace overshadowed the event.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's kind of humorous that they would take that tack,&quot; David Axelrod, Obama's senior campaign adviser, said Monday. &quot;When Mr. Trump went off the deep end again, [Romney] did not rebuke him because he said he needed to get 50.1 percent of the vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, Axelrod added, Romney has sought fundraising help other famous names, including musicians Kid Rock and Ted Nugent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think they have a whole lot of standing on this issue,&quot; Axelrod said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Romney's drawing power among Hollywood's elite pales in comparison to Obama's. At a Beverly Hills fundraiser last week, Romney's biggest-name guests were former &quot;Happy Days&quot; star Scott Baio and actor Jon Voight, who is also Angelina Jolie's father. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has drawn support from Hollywood's biggest names and biggest bundlers, including moviemaking titans Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg. The fundraiser last week at Clooney's house - for which the campaign also held a raffle for ordinary supporters - included actors Tobey Maguire, Jack Black and Salma Hayek and singer Barbra Streisand. The campaign walked away with a whopping $15 million, its largest single-event total, including the raffle and $40,000-per-plate tickets for 150 guests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many cases, the Obama campaign has used celebrities to target specific constituencies. Eva Longoria, a campaign bundler who is a constant presence at Obama events, is popular among Hispanic women. Last month, Obama was introduced at a New York event by openly gay singer Ricky Martin, just days after the president expressed support for same-sex marriage.Martin told the crowd that he admires &quot;the courage he showed last week in affirming his belief in marriage equality. That is the kind of courage we expect from our president and that is why we support him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks on Obama's fascination with celebrities are not new. In 2008, Republican rival John McCain endorsed a video called &quot;Celebrity&quot; that mocked Obama's popularity and included images of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          &quot;He's the biggest celebrity in the world. But is he ready to lead?&quot; the ad intoned.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That ad did little to damp Obama's appeal, especially among young voters. John Weaver, a Republican strategist who had called the McCain video &quot;childish,&quot; said Monday that the RNC attack also would have little effect on voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're trying to influence opinion leaders and journalists,&quot; Weaver said. &quot;But no voter cares about this issue, and it will not shape the opinion of any voters. What matters is whether the employment situation will improve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet for the Obama campaign, the need to recapture the enthusiasm of 2008 has grown more urgent with the economy still struggling. Heather Smith, president of the youth-oriented Rock the Vote, said there are 25 million unregistered voters under 30 years old, a far higher number than at the same time four years ago. &quot;All our polling shows an increased level of frustration with the pace of change, with the control of money and corporate interests in our political process,&quot; she said, citing the Occupy Wall Street and tea party movements as offshoots of that frustration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question for the president will be not whether he uses celebrity spokespeople, but how he uses them and what kind of message they convey,&quot; Smith added. &quot;People are worse off than they were four years ago. So it's not just a straight to camera 'go vote' campaign. They need to leverage celebrities to actually talk about the issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's celebrity surrogates have begun to help in that regard, a la Martin's comments on same-sex marriage. But in many cases, the praise has been more effusive the other direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We raised a lot of money because everybody loves George,&quot; Obama told supporters at the Clooney event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They like me,&quot; the president said. &quot;They love him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's reelection campaign, facing an onslaught of attack ads from well-funded conservative interest groups, is concentrating its television advertising in fewer states than in his 2008 presidential bid, a review of campaign spending shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike in his first campaign, when Obama held a significant financial advantage over Republican John McCain, his resources in the current contest are more evenly matched with those of Mitt Romney, the GOP nominee. That is in large part because of the spending by independent interest groups, which favor Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign has placed ads in fewer than 60 media markets nationwide,  skipping some expensive areas such as Philadelphia and Washington, compared with 80 in the early weeks of the 2008 general-election campaign. In 2008, Obama began running ads against McCain in late June.          The president's campaign has put an increased focus on Ohio, which has become the most competitive big prize in the race. Four of the most saturated media markets for presidential advertising are in Ohio, and Obama's campaign has spent more on broadcast advertising there than in Florida, another critical swing state with about twice the population.            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is in contrast to Obama's spending in the opening weeks of 2008, when Florida received nearly twice as much advertising money as Ohio, according to estimates of spending from Kantar Media/CMAG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can win without Ohio, but if they win Ohio they will be reelected,&quot; said Jim Jordan, a Democratic strategist.  He and others say that if Obama can repeat his 2008 victory in Ohio, he would need to secure just two or three of the other roughly half-dozen most competitive  swing states. &quot;There's just no way Romney can win without flipping Ohio,&quot; Jordan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign officials said they have not emphasized television advertising, choosing instead to focus on face-to-face interactions with voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that being on the ground in communities all across the country is where the real conversations about the choice in this election happen,&quot; said Katie Hogan, a campaign spokeswoman. &quot;This campaign set out to expand the map in 2011, making as many routes to victory as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign also has made Ohio the biggest target of an expanded voter-mobilization effort, opening 25 field offices in the state funded with most of the $2.6 million transferred to the Ohio state party, more funding than any other part of the country has received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By comparison, Romney is far behind Obama when it comes to field offices and the other infrastructure needed to make voter contacts. Obama and the Democratic Party have four times as many staff members around the country as Romney and the Republicans, according to a Washington Post analysis of campaign spending reports through April 30, the latest information available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul dismissed the importance of the Obama team's larger field operation, saying, &quot;No matter how many hundreds of field offices and campaign staffers they have, it won't make up for the 23 million Americans who are struggling for work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategists say the Obama campaign's focus on Ohio is a tacit admission that it may be easier for the president to win than the biggest swing state, Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, ad spending by the campaign is targeted: More than a third of the Florida spending has been in the Orlando market, reaching the greatest concentration of swing voters along the I-4 corridor. Four years ago, 1 in 6 television dollars was spent in Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spending in a handful of smaller states - Colorado, Iowa, Nevada and Virginia - reflects a second tier of battle. Nevada alone, with only six electoral votes, has received $2.2 million in advertising money from Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Wisconsin, the Obama campaign has focused on face-to-face voter contact ahead of Tuesday's election to recall Gov. Scott Walker (R), leaving the airwaves to state candidates. The outcome of the effort will determine how much the two presidential campaigns focus on the state before November, strategists say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls suggest that North Carolina may be tough for Obama to win this year, but his campaign has not pulled back on its investment there. The state, which will host the Democratic National Convention just after Labor Day, has brought in $2.3 million in ad spending from the Obama campaign, the largest share after Ohio and Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard for them to pull out of North Carolina,&quot; said Ken Goldstein, who tracks political ad spending as president of Kantar Media/CMAG, &quot;but at some point they're going to have to make a hardheaded decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has made a very limited investment in Arizona, although campaign officials said they would like to see the traditionally red state become a battleground. The campaign has bought no television time there and has opened five offices, compared with a dozen or more in neighboring Nevada, which has half the population. The Arizona Democratic Party has received just $322,000 from the Democratic National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's campaign has been able to save money on television ads because Republican interest groups have spent millions attacking Obama on his behalf. His campaign is running ads in six states, but, like Obama's, is concentrating on Ohio, spending one in three ad dollars there.           Some Republicans point to Obama's poor showing in Democratic primaries in the coal states of West Virginia and Kentucky, saying that could spell trouble for him in southeastern Ohio.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People that are upset don't stop at borders,&quot; said Bob Bennett, the Ohio Republican Party chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a small portion of Ohio's  population lives in that part of the state, however. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Obama won the state in large part by turning out minority voters and winning over suburbanites around major cities. That year, he was the first Democrat to win the Columbus media market since former president Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, said Mike Dawson, a Republican and Ohio elections expert. Obama formally launched his campaign in Columbus last month, highlighting the region's importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The key is going to be the Columbus media market,&quot; Dawson said, adding that &quot;it was such an aberration.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if you disagree with every one of Mitt Romney's policies, there's a chance he'd still be the best presidential candidate to lift the economy in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not because he has business experience. For all his bluster about the lessons he learned in the private sector, his agenda is indistinguishable from that of career politician Paul Ryan. Nor is it because he has demonstrated some special knowledge of what it takes to create jobs. Job growth in Massachusetts was notably slow when he was governor. It's because if Romney is elected, Republicans won't choose to crash the economy in 2013.          The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if Congress gridlocks this year - if it simply gets nothing done - the economy will take a $607 billion hit in 2013 as the George W. Bush tax cuts expire, the payroll tax cut expires and assorted spending cuts kick in. Falling off that &quot;fiscal cliff,&quot; they predict, would throw the nation back into recession.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's even worse than that: House Speaker John A. Boehner has said he wants another debt-ceiling showdown. The country is not expected to hit the ceiling until February or March, so the only scenario in which that threshold matters is one in which Congress has already pushed the nation over a fiscal cliff. So as bad as the last debt-ceiling crisis was - and Gallup's polling showed it did more damage to consumer confidence than the fall of Lehman Brothers - this one would be worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miles Nadal, chief executive of the communications firm MDC Partners, says that at a recent event with executives from more than 100 companies, the business leaders, panicked about this possibility, agreed on the best outcome for the economy: &quot;A Republican landslide.&quot; Why? &quot;Because anything that breaks the logjam is positive,&quot; he says. &quot;The quality of the leader is less relevant than the ability to break gridlock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no reason to believe that Romney could &quot;break&quot; gridlock. But there is reason to believe that he wouldn't face it in the first place. Republicans control the House. They're three seats away from controlling the Senate - and, because this Senate election follows 2006, which was a wave election for Democrats, Republicans are defending 10 seats while Democrats are defending 23. It's difficult to imagine a scenario in which Romney wins the White House and Republicans don't control the House and the Senate. On the other side, although it's not impossible to imagine President Obama winning a second term and Democrats taking back the House, it's unlikely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney and the Republicans probably won't reach 60 seats in the Senate, but they won't need them. The major issues on the table are budget-related. That means they can be considered using the budget reconciliation process, which can't be filibustered. So if Republicans can maintain party unity - and they usually can - they'll be able to govern effectively. And there's no way that they'll permit the Bush tax cuts to expire or the debt ceiling to lapse. Investors, knowing that, probably would stop worrying about the debt ceiling the moment a Romney win became clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Republicans could still push the economy into recession if they passed an immediate austerity budget that slashed spending in 2013. And, given Republican rhetoric about how cutting the size of government would lead to more growth because the confidence fairy would persuade businesses to spend more, you might think that's exactly what they'd do. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Romney, although he often buys into that sort of nonsense while criticizing Obama, knows better. Time magazine asked him about cutting spending in 2013. &quot;If you take a trillion dollars, for instance, out of the first year of the federal budget, that would shrink GDP over 5 percent,&quot; Romney said. &quot;That is by definition throwing us into recession or depression. So I'm not going to do that, of course.&quot; You couldn't have gotten a clearer definition of Keynesian budgeting from Obama.There's a good chance that a Romney administration would extend both Bush and Obama tax cuts and delay the scheduled spending cuts. Congress would raise the debt ceiling after Romney promised congressional Republicans that he'd sign some variation of  Ryan's budget. Somewhere along the way, Romney would pass  more short-term tax cuts and a long-term transportation bill - something Republicans have been blocking under Obama - that double as an infrastructure package and include, to secure Republican support, the Keystone XL oil pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compared to anything Obama is likely to get from a Republican House, that is, at least in the short term, it's a much more expansionary, Keynesian approach. But it's also an awful precedent. In a sense, Republicans are holding a gun to the economy's head and saying, &quot;Vote for us or the recovery gets it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That might prove an effective political strategy: The more they say they're willing to let the debt ceiling expire and the economy run over the fiscal cliff, the more businesses will pull back and households will stop spending to make sure they have enough cash on hand to ride out another crisis. That will further depress the economy this year, making it more likely that Romney wins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Obama wins, it's of course possible that the two sides will come to a swift agreement. That's the president's prediction. &quot;I believe that if we're successful in this election, when we're successful in this election, that the fever may break, because there's a tradition in the Republican Party of more common sense than that,&quot; Obama has said. &quot;My hope, my expectation, is that after the election, now that it turns out that the goal of beating Obama doesn't make much sense because I'm not running again, that we can start getting some cooperation again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But privately, many top Democrats acknowledge that congressional Republicans, angry after a narrow loss and appealing to a base that is likely to blame the defeat on Romney's moderate past, might prove even more obstructionist after the election than before it. If that happens, they say, the president can't keep giving in to Republican threats. Much as the government shutdowns in the 1990s discredited Newt Gingrich's hardball tactics, Obama will have to let voters see the consequences of the tea party's approach. But although that might be sage political advice, the economic consequences could be devastating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the logical conclusion of a system biased toward gridlock: The minority party benefits when the public thinks Washington is failing and it often has the power to make Washington fail. That leads to another unusual reality about this election: Even if you agree with Romney's policies, it may be that voting for Obama, and delivering a landslide against the GOP's economic brinksmanship, is the only way to break the dangerous cycle of strategic gridlock going forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So which are you more worried about: The fiscal cliff and the debt ceiling or the political system?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1031 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's reelection campaign, facing an onslaught of attack ads from well-funded conservative interest groups, is concentrating its television advertising in fewer states than in his 2008 presidential bid, a review of campaign spending shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike in his first campaign, when Obama held a significant financial advantage over Republican John McCain, his resources in the current contest are more evenly matched with those of Mitt Romney, the GOP nominee. That is in large part because of the spending by independent interest groups, which favor Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign has placed adsin fewer than 60 media markets nationwide,  skipping some expensive areas such as Philadelphia and Washington, compared with 80 in the early weeks of the 2008 general-election campaign. In 2008, Obama began running ads against McCain in late June. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's campaign has put an increased focus on Ohio, which has become the most competitive big prize in the race. Four of the most saturated media markets for presidential advertising are in Ohio, and Obama's campaign has spent more on broadcast advertising there than in Florida, another critical swing state with about twice the population. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is in contrast to Obama's spending in the opening weeks of 2008, when Florida received nearly twice as much advertising money as Ohio, according to estimates of spending from Kantar Media/CMAG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can win without Ohio, but if they win Ohio they will be reelected,&quot; said Jim Jordan, a Democratic strategist.  He and others say that if Obama can repeat his 2008 victory in Ohio, he would need to secure just two or three of the other roughly half-dozen most competitive swing states. &quot;There's just no way Romney can win without flipping Ohio,&quot; Jordan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign officials said they have not emphasized television advertising, choosing instead to focus on face-to-face interactions with voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that being on the ground in communities all across the country is where the real conversations about the choice in this election happen,&quot; said Katie Hogan, a campaign spokeswoman. &quot;This campaign set out to expand the map in 2011, making as many routes to victory as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign also has made Ohio the biggest target of an expanded voter-mobilization effort, opening 25 field offices in the state funded with most of the $2.6 million transferred to the Ohio state party, more funding than any other part of the country has received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By comparison, Romney is far behind Obama when it comes to field offices and the other infrastructure needed to make voter contacts. Obama and the Democratic Party have four times as many staff members around the country as Romney and the Republicans, according to a Washington Post analysis of campaign spending reports through April 30, the latest information available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul dismissed the importance of the Obama team's larger field operation, saying, &quot;No matter how many hundreds of field offices and campaign staffers they have, it won't make up for the 23 million Americans who are struggling for work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategists say the Obama campaign's focus on Ohio is a tacit admission that it may be easier for the president to win than the biggest swing state, Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, ad spending by the campaign is targeted: More than a third of the Florida spending has been in the Orlando market, reaching the greatest concentration of swing voters along the I-4 corridor. Four years ago, 1 in 6 television dollars was spent in Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spending in a handful of smaller states - Colorado, Iowa, Nevada and Virginia - reflects a second tier of battle. Nevada alone, with only six electoral votes, has received $2.2 million in advertising money from Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Wisconsin, the Obama campaign has focused on face-to-face voter contact ahead of Tuesday's election to recall Gov. Scott Walker (R), leaving the airwaves to state candidates. The outcome of the effort will determine how much the two presidential campaigns focus on the state before November, strategists say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls suggest that North Carolina may be tough for Obama to win this year, but his campaign has not pulled back on its investment there. The state, which will host the Democratic National Convention just after Labor Day, has brought in $2.3 million in ad spending from the Obama campaign, the largest share after Ohio and Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard for them to pull out of North Carolina,&quot; said Ken Goldstein, who tracks political ad spending as president of Kantar Media/CMAG, &quot;but at some point they're going to have to make a hardheaded decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has made a very limited investment in Arizona, although campaign officials said they would like to see the traditionally red state become a battleground. The campaign has bought no television time there and has opened five offices, compared with a dozen or more in neighboring Nevada, which has half the population. The Arizona Democratic Party has received just $322,000 from the Democratic National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's campaign has been able to save money on television ads because Republican interest groups have spent millions attacking Obama on his behalf. His campaign is running ads in six states, but, like Obama's, is concentrating on Ohio, spending one in three ad dollars there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Republicans point to Obama's poor showing in Democratic primaries in the coal states of West Virginia and Kentucky, saying that could spell trouble for him in southeastern Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People that are upset don't stop at borders,&quot; said Bob Bennett, the Ohio Republican Party chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a small portion of Ohio's  population lives in that part of the state, however. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Obama won the state in large part by turning out minority voters and winning over suburbanites around major cities. That year, he was the first Democrat to win the Columbus media market since former president Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, said Mike Dawson, a Republican and Ohio elections expert. Obama formally launched his campaign in Columbus last month, highlighting the region's importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The key is going to be the Columbus media market,&quot; Dawson said, adding that &quot;it was such an aberration.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if you disagree with every one of Mitt Romney's policies, there's a chance he'd still be the best presidential candidate to lift the economy in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not because he has business experience. For all his bluster about the lessons he learned in the private sector, his agenda is indistinguishable from that of career politician Paul Ryan. Nor is it because he has demonstrated some special knowledge of what it takes to create jobs. Job growth in Massachusetts was notably slow when he was governor. It's because if Romney is elected, Republicans won't choose to crash the economy in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if Congress gridlocks this year - if it simply gets nothing done - the economy will take a $607 billion hit in 2013 as the George W. Bush tax cuts expire, the payroll tax cut expires and assorted spending cuts kick in. Falling off that &quot;fiscal cliff,&quot; they predict, would throw the nation back into recession. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's even worse than that: House Speaker John A. Boehner has saidhe wants another debt-ceiling showdown.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama dined last month with 150 guests at George Clooney's California cottage. He exchanged quips in January with Spike Lee in the director's New York City townhouse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last fall, Obama entertained megastar Lady Gaga, who was seated in the front row of a Silicon Valley fundraiser in six-inch heels and a towering blond bouffant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's popularity with Hollywood glitterati is again on display as his campaign mobilizes its vast fundraising apparatus to amass cash in a campaign that is shaping up to be the most expensive in U.S. history. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Obama was the candidate of cool in 2008, when celebrities such as musician Will.I.Am produced viral campaign videoshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY, he has even more aggressively employed star power to open pocketbooks, build buzz and, perhaps most notably, deploy celebrities to target specific constituencies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Obama's glamorous elbow-rubbing carries significant risks as he struggles to convince voters that he is focused single-mindedly on their economic concerns. And it is  triggering attacks from his Republican rivals, who contend that the president is more interested in hobnobbing with Hollywood to help his campaign than he is in helping ordinary Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the Republican National Committee released a Web video called &quot;Meanwhile,&quot; which flashes unemployment numbers for various groups - women, Latinos, African Americans, youth - under clips from an Obama campaign video from last Friday of Vogue Editor Anna Wintour talking about hanging out with &quot;Sex and the City&quot; star Sarah Jessica Parker and first lady Michelle Obama. The bustling sounds of New York City streets give way to crickets chirping at the end of the RNC version, along with the tag line: &quot;Obama's focused on keeping his job. But what about yours?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Obama faced similar accusations in 2008, the charges are potentially more dangerous this time given that he is a sitting president responsible for managing the economy, rather than being just one of 100 senators. Yet the Obama campaign sees Hollywood as a powerful and necessary ally, able to both raise large amounts of money and also speak directly to important subgroups of voters who identify with the famous. On Monday, as his celebrity ties became an issue, Obama hosted rock star Jon Bon Jovi on Air Force One on the way to fundraisers in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fundraiser with Wintour and Parker, for example, is part of an effort to appeal to women; the reelection team next week is offering supporters a chance to win a raffle (entry fee $3) to attend the New York City event. In a fundraising e-mail to supporters Monday, Michelle Obama called Parker &quot;a loving mom, an incredibly hard worker, and a great role model&quot; and added: &quot;She's one of those people you can't help but admire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC response video mocked the timing of the Obama video's release. The video &quot;highlights how out of touch President Obama and his campaign are after releasing a glitzy fundraising video featuring Vogue chief Anna Wintour the same day as a dismal jobs report,&quot; RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said, referring to a Labor Department report that showed the economy added just 69,000 jobs in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign struck back quickly, pointing out that Romney appeared last week with developer Donald Trump, host of the television show &quot;The Apprentice.&quot; Trump's controversial comments questioning Obama's birthplace overshadowed the event. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's kind of humorous that they would take that tack,&quot; David Axelrod, Obama's senior campaign adviser, said Monday. &quot;When Mr. Trump went off the deep end again, [Romney] did not rebuke him because he said he needed to get 50.1 percent of the vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, Axelrod added, Romney has sought fundraising help other famous names, including musicians Kid Rock and Ted Nugent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think they have a whole lot of standing on this issue,&quot; Axelrod said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Romney's drawing power among Hollywood's elite pales in comparison to Obama's. At a Beverly Hills fundraiser last week, Romney's biggest-name guests were former &quot;Happy Days&quot; star Scott Baio and actor Jon Voight, who is also Angelina Jolie's father. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has drawn support from Hollywood's biggest names and biggest bundlers, including moviemaking titans Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg. The fundraiser last week at Clooney's house - for which the campaign also held a raffle for ordinary supporters - included actors Tobey Maguire, Jack Black and Salma Hayek and singer Barbra Streisand. The campaign walked away with a whopping $15 million, its largest single-event total, including the raffle and $40,000-per-plate tickets for 150 guests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many cases, the Obama campaign has used celebrities to target specific constituencies. Eva Longoria, a campaign bundler who is a constant presence at Obama events, is popular among Hispanic women. Last month, Obama was introduced at a New York event by openly gay singer Ricky Martin, just days after the president expressed support for same-sex marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin told the crowd that he admires &quot;the courage he showed last week in affirming his belief in marriage equality. That is the kind of courage we expect from our president and that is why we support him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks on Obama's fascination with celebrities are not new. In 2008, Republican rival John McCain endorsed a video called &quot;Celebrity&quot; that mocked Obama's popularity and included images of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's the biggest celebrity in the world. But is he ready to lead?&quot; the ad intoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That ad did little to damp Obama's appeal, especially among young voters. John Weaver, a Republican strategist who had called the McCain video &quot;childish,&quot; said Monday that the RNC attack also would have little effect on voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're trying to influence opinion leaders and journalists,&quot; Weaver said. &quot;But no voter cares about this issue, and it will not shape the opinion of any voters. What matters is whether the employment situation will improve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet for the Obama campaign, the need to recapture the enthusiasm of 2008 has grown more urgent with the economy still struggling. Heather Smith, president of the youth-oriented Rock the Vote, said there are 25 million unregistered voters under 30 years old, a far higher number than at the same time four years ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All our polling shows an increased level of frustration with the pace of change, with the control of money and corporate interests in our political process,&quot; she said, citing the Occupy Wall Street and tea party movements as offshoots of that frustration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question for the president will be not whether he uses celebrity spokespeople, but how he uses them and what kind of message they convey,&quot; Smith added. &quot;People are worse off than they were four years ago. So it's not just a straight to camera 'go vote' campaign. They need to leverage celebrities to actually talk about the issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's celebrity surrogates have begun to help in that regard, a la Martin's comments on same-sex marriage. But in many cases, the praise has been more effusive the other direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We raised a lot of money because everybody loves George,&quot; Obama told supporters at the Clooney event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They like me,&quot; the president said. &quot;They love him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama continued his attacks on Mitt Romney's tenure as Massachusetts governor on Monday, releasing a new television ad that describes Mr. Romney's economic record in the state as a failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, titled &quot;Heard It Before,&quot; shows Mr. Romney saying that he speaks &quot;the language of business.&quot; But the ad cites newspaper articles which suggest that Mr. Romney presided over one of &quot;the worst economic records in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs,&quot; the narrator says. &quot;And fell to forty-seventh in job creation. Fourth from the bottom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for Mr. Obama, said the ad would run in nine battleground states. Mr. LaBolt said the amount of money being spent on the ad is &quot;significant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Mr. Romney dismissed the ad as an effort by Mr. Obama to change the subject from the country's economic condition during his watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're happy to compare the 4.7 percent unemployment rate Mitt Romney achieved in Massachusetts to President Obama's weak record any day,&quot; said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman, in a statement. &quot;President Obama's policies have failed to get Americans back to work - it's time for a president who has worked in the real world economy and understands how to get this economy moving again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama's campaign shows little willingness to back away from their attacks on Mr. Romney's record as governor. Last week, the campaign produced a Web video on the topic and held a related event on the steps of the Statehouse in Boston. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an appearance on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation&quot; on Sunday, David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, defended the approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we're arguing is whether he's qualified to call himself a job creator. That's not what he did in his business. That's not the purpose of his business, and it's certainly not what he did in Massachusetts where they had one of the worst economic records in the country,&quot; Mr. Axelrod said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So when you hold yourself out as an economical oracle and you say to people, 'Trust me, I know how to move the country forward,' and your record says something else, of course, you're going to get challenged for that,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The bleak jobs report on Friday predictably had heads snapping toward the White House, looking to President Obama to do something. Yet his proposed remedies only underscore how much the president, just five months before he faces voters, is at the mercy of actors in Europe, China and Congress whose political interests often conflict with his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That day, Mr. Obama continued his weekly travels around the country, prodding Congressional Republicans to pass his ''to-do list'' of temporary tax cuts and spending initiatives to help create jobs. The Republicans only mock him, which leaves Mr. Obama free to blame his opponents and their presidential standard-bearer, Mitt Romney. But in doing so, he telegraphs a message of powerlessness that no leader likes to convey -- least of all one who ran for office four years ago vowing to bridge Washington's partisan gulf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Developments overseas have not helped either. American officials have complained as Beijing began letting its currency devalue again, making its exports cheaper and those from the United States to China more costly. And administration officials, and Mr. Obama himself, have lobbied leaders in Europe for more forceful action to promote growth or at least contain the threat of financial contagion there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his weekly address on Saturday, recorded on Friday at a Honeywell International plant near Minneapolis, the president cited the global woes buffeting the economy. But he singled out Congress for rebuke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''While we can't fully control everything that happens in other parts of the world, there are plenty of things we can control here at home,'' Mr. Obama said. ''There are plenty of steps we can take right now to help create jobs and grow this economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without mentioning Republicans, Mr. Obama said Congress had not passed measures he had proposed to get jobless construction workers rebuilding roads, bridges and runways; to give small businesses a tax break for new hires; and to help states pay teachers, firefighters and police officers. The steady elimination of public sector jobs has offset increased hiring in the private sector for more than two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''So my message to Congress is: Get to work,'' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan J. Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said, ''Frankly, I don't see what President Obama can do right now other than to forcefully present a detailed plan for action and challenge Congress to take it up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ''short of a real crisis,'' as in 2008, Mr. Auerbach, an expert on fiscal policy, added, ''I doubt that there is anything he can do to spur meaningful legislation before the election.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet even in 2008, with the financial system near collapse, most Congressional Republicans rejected the rescue plan of a Republican president, George W. Bush. And now, despite their own record-low numbers in the polls, they have next to no incentive to help an embattled Democratic president lift the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continued economic anemia plays to Mr. Romney's call for new stewardship, and to Republicans' demands to extend and deepen the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans rather than let them expire, as Mr. Obama and Democrats want. And they figure that if Mr. Romney succeeds, it will probably help them win close House and Senate races, while Mr. Obama's re-election could do the opposite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By emboldening Republicans, the report on Friday that the economy added only 69,000 jobs in May seemed to dash the hopes of some in the White House for a replay of 1996. That summer, as President Bill Clinton sought re-election with the economy improving, Republicans in Congress decided that their party's weak presidential nominee, Senator Bob Dole, was doomed. To Mr. Dole's chagrin, they compromised with the Democratic president to notch some significant achievements and ensure their own survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gene Sperling, the chief White House economic adviser, said, ''There is no question that had Congress acted on the president's proposals nine months ago to prevent teacher layoffs, put construction workers back to work and cut small-business taxes, our job situation today would be notably stronger and unemployment would be lower.'' Analyses by macroeconomic firms and nonpartisan financial analysts agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Obama seeks to make Republicans the villains when it comes to the economy, he is also, more diplomatically, blaming Europe. In Minneapolis and Chicago on Friday, he cited the impact of the continent's travails on the American economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing the jobs report, Mr. Obama said, ''A lot of that is attributable to Europe and the cloud that's coming over from the Atlantic, and the whole world economy has been weakened by it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As lackluster as the American jobs data was, with unemployment inching up one-tenth of a percentage point to 8.2 percent, the news from Europe was far worse: the jobless rate in the euro zone hit 11 percent, the highest since tracking began in 1995. ''There's really nothing the U.S. can do,'' said Charles Calomiris, professor of finance and economics at Columbia Business School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Mr. Obama had a video conference call with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Francois Hollande of France and Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy to discuss developments in Europe and plan for this month's G-20 summit meeting in Mexico. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner continued to trade calls with Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble. And late Friday, Mr. Obama's Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, Lael Brainard, returned from a week of consultations in Athens, Frankfurt, Madrid, Paris and Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama ''emphasizes that what happens in Europe is of global concern,'' said Michael Froman, the White House adviser for international economic affairs. ''We want to be of help, whether in providing ideas or lessons from our experience as they work through these issues.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more than two years, Mr. Obama and Mr. Geithner have prodded Europe, led by Germany, to do more to revive the region's weakest economies rather than push budget cuts, which have resulted in more losses of jobs and consumer spending power. Their results, however, have been limited at best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany has shown some willingness to bend. Officials in Berlin have signaled that they could accept higher wages at home and inflation above the euro zone's average. Last week, a finance ministry spokesman said Germany could be more flexible about the timing of budget cuts in Spain -- after Greece, the source of greatest anxiety now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Germans are deeply concerned that supporting big transfers of aid to troubled countries within the euro zone will create a precedent and the expectation in other countries that they, or their banks, will be bailed out whenever necessary. Germans also believe that issuing debt jointly with other European countries, known as euro bonds, which the United States supports, would be struck down as unconstitutional by their high court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they routinely dismiss any criticism from across the Atlantic as election-year politicking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Germans do not think Americans have anything to offer at the moment in terms of helping us with the euro crisis,'' said Thomas Risse, professor of international politics at the Free University in Berlin. ''Everyone thinks it's just about Obama's re-election here, which is wrong, but they think it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the United States said this spring that it would not increase its contribution to the International Monetary Fund, its influence in Europe was blunted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, ''the I.M.F. appears to not be having the influence it usually does,'' said Franklin Allen, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. ''It seems like Berlin is making all the decisions at the moment.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">&quot;With regards to Bain Capital, they just put a report out about their record, the Bain Capital guys did. They noted they made about 350 investments since the beginning of their firm, and of those investments 80 percent of them grew their revenues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">- Mitt Romney on Fox News, May 24</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the &quot;100,000 jobs created&quot; at Bain Capital claim _blankhas been discredited, we sense a new talking point developing in the Romney campaign - that 80 percent of Bain investments &quot;grew their revenues.&quot;          We've been highly skeptical of most of the attacks on Bain by the former Massachusetts governor's _blankGOP rivals and _blankthe Obama campaign, arguing on numerous _blankoccasions that the overall record of the investment firm is pretty good. But the point of private equity is to reward investors, not necessarily create jobs, which is where Mitt Romney's defenders create problems for themselves.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So now Romney is citing Bain's claim that 80 percent of its investments increased its revenue. Ed Gillespie, one of his aides, even suggested that revenue &quot;means that jobs were created.&quot; Is that the case?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          The Facts          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This new statistic appears to have emerged in _blanka lengthy defense that Bain Capital - which Romney headed until 1999 - sent to its investors in March. (We should note that the letter approvingly quotes The Fact Checker for _blankone of our analyses of an anti-Bain ad by Newt Gingrich.) The Bain letter said:          &quot;Despite political attacks that tend to emphasize the few companies that have struggled, the facts are that revenues grew during our ownership in 80 percent of the more than 350 companies in which we have invested. Our growth-oriented approach is reflected by our current portfolio companies, which have opened over 5,000 stores and facilities during our ownership. . . . Through more than a generation of investing, less than 5 percent of our companies filed for bankruptcy while under our control.&quot;           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 5 percent bankruptcy figure may be a surprise to people familiar with the Wall Street Journal's _blankcomprehensive examination of Bain Capital's investments, which found that &quot;about 22 percent of the companies either filed for bankruptcy or liquidated by the end of the eighth year after Bain invested.&quot; The operative words in the Bain statement are &quot;under our control.&quot; As long as Bain owned less than 50 percent - often the case if there had been a public share offering - then the success or failure apparently would not end up in Bain's statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the assertion that 80 percent of the investments yielded rising revenue, the Romney campaign directed us to Bain Capital. We asked for an accounting of the 350 firms and their revenue gain. Charlyn Lusk, a Bain spokeswoman, said she would answer our questions. In the end, we only received a statement reiterating  that &quot;we stand behind the information in the letter we sent to our investors in March.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's why the 80 percent figure is problematic: It tells you almost nothing about the success or failure of these companies. In fact, it is almost surprising that the figure is not nearly 100 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bain statement is so vague and imprecise that, in theory, revenue could grow in a single year, but fall in other years, and still be claimed as a growth in revenue. Moreover, the statistic takes no account of whether the business ultimately failed, despite revenue growth, because under Bain's direction it had taken on too much debt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an example, let's look at Ampad, the paper company that was the subject of _blanka recent Obama&nbsp;ad.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With regards to Bain Capital, they just put a report out about their record, the Bain Capital guys did. They noted they made about 350 investments since the beginning of their firm, and of those investments 80 percent of them grew their revenues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Mitt Romney on Fox News, May 24 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the &quot;100,000 jobs created&quot; at Bain Capital claim _blankhas been discredited, we sense a new talking point developing in the Romney campaign - that 80 percent of Bain investments &quot;grew their revenues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've been highly skeptical of most of the attacks on Bain by the former Massachusetts governor's _blankGOP rivals and _blankthe Obama campaign, arguing on numerous _blankoccasions that the overall record of the investment firm is pretty good. But the point of private equity is to reward investors, not necessarily create jobs, which is where Mitt Romney's defenders create problems for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So now Romney is citing Bain's claim that 80 percent of its investments increased its revenue. Ed Gillespie, one of his aides, even suggested that revenue &quot;means that jobs were created.&quot; Is that the case?<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The Facts</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This new statistic appears to have emerged in _blanka lengthy defense that Bain Capital - which Romney headed until 1999 - sent to its investors in March. (We should note that the letter approvingly quotes The Fact Checker for _blankone of our analyses of an anti-Bain ad by Newt Gingrich.) The Bain letter said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite political attacks that tend to emphasize the few companies that have struggled, the facts are that revenues grew during our ownership in 80 percent of the more than 350 companies in which we have invested. Our growth-oriented approach is reflected by our current portfolio companies, which have opened over 5,000 stores and facilities during our ownership. . . . Through more than a generation of investing, less than 5 percent of our companies filed for bankruptcy while under our control.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 5 percent bankruptcy figure may be a surprise to people familiar with the Wall Street Journal's _blankcomprehensive examination of Bain Capital's investments, which found that &quot;about 22 percent of the companies either filed for bankruptcy or liquidated by the end of the eighth year after Bain invested.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operative words in the Bain statement are &quot;under our control.&quot; As long as Bain owned less than 50 percent - often the case if there had been a public share offering - then the success or failure apparently would not end up in Bain's statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the assertion that 80 percent of the investments yielded rising revenue, the Romney campaign directed us to Bain Capital. We asked for an accounting of the 350 firms and their revenue gain. Charlyn Lusk, a Bain spokeswoman, said she would answer our questions. In the end, we only received a statement reiterating  that &quot;we stand behind the information in the letter we sent to our investors in March.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's why the 80 percent figure is problematic: It tells you almost nothing about the success or failure of these companies. In fact, it is almost surprising that the figure is not nearly 100 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bain statement is so vague and imprecise that, in theory, revenue could grow in a single year, but fall in other years, and still be claimed as a growth in revenue. Moreover, the statistic takes no account of whether the business ultimately failed, despite revenue growth, because under Bain's direction it had taken on too much debt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an example, let's look at Ampad, the paper company that was the subject of _blanka recent Obama&nbsp;ad. The company showed tremendous growth during the period of Bain's control - in other words, before it offered shares to the public and Bain began to cash out. _blankDocuments filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that revenue, mainly through acquisitions, grew from $104 million in 1993 to $617 million in 1995. This, as we have noted before, was the company strategy - to build revenue through acquisitions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Success story? After the initial public offering - when Bain reaped about $50 million and its control fell below 50 percent -_blank revenue started to fall, to $572 million in 1999. Interest payments on the debt, run up to build that revenue, exceeded gross profits. In the space of a few years, the stock price _blankwent from $26 a share to 15 cents, at which point the company filed for bankruptcy protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet presumably, this company is part of Bain's 80 percent &quot;success&quot; rate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, there are _blanksophisticated_blank studies that show additional business revenue can mean more jobs. But, unlike those studies, Bain has not been transparent about how this statistic was derived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The weak employment report on Friday held the potential to reshape the presidential campaign, members of both parties said, lifting Mitt Romney's efforts to make the race all about President Obama's handling of the economy and making it harder for Democrats to break through in their efforts to define Mr. Romney on their terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Capitol Hill, the signs of a slowdown focused new attention on the economic implications of the partisan standoff over tax and spending policy. On the campaign trail, both sides saw the news as a potential turning point in a critical battle at this stage. The race may be a referendum on Mr. Obama, as Republicans want, or, as Democrats prefer, a choice between a president nursing the economy back to health and a challenger who represents the failed policies that caused the crisis in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats in particular were left off balance, sensing that most of their policy ammunition has been spent and that Republicans have nothing to gain politically from lending a hand on a compromise that could spur economic growth this year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's going to be a close election. Everybody's worried,'' said Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee. ''We've already floored the accelerator. We've already gripped the steering wheel. I'm not sure they're attached to anything anymore.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a stop in Minneapolis, Mr. Obama renewed his call on Congress to enact measures to revive the economy, warning that they were needed not only to shake the United States out of its torpor, but to act as a buffer against storm clouds in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Our economy is still facing some serious headwinds'' from high gas prices and the financial crisis in Europe, he said from a factory floor at Honeywell International. Europe, in particular, he said, is ''having an impact worldwide and is starting to cast a shadow on our own'' recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney fired back that the president was simply finding a new way to deflect blame for an economic malaise that his policies were prolonging. His campaign said that Mr. Romney's core message that it was time for a change in economic stewardship would resonate more clearly among voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is the race that we came ready to run,'' said Stuart Stevens, Mr. Romney's chief strategist. ''This is the race that we believed we would be in.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The signs that the recovery is being derailed could further complicate maneuvering over the fiscal cliff the federal government faces at the end of the year. The government faces nearly $8 trillion in higher taxes and automatic spending cuts when all of the Bush-era tax cuts expire at the same time that $1.2 trillion of automatic spending cuts on military and domestic programs go into force in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have called for an extension of all those tax cuts and a cancellation of the military cuts, and said Friday that a weaker economy would make it all the more urgent to avoid tax increases this year. Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats favor allowing tax cuts for the rich to expire and have stood firm on the automatic cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Instead of another campaign speech, the president might want to engage with Democrats and Republicans here on Capitol Hill to handle the big policies that are affecting our economy,'' the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, said, citing the looming tax increases and spending cuts and the growing national debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, said Friday that she saw no reason for Democrats to drop their insistence on allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for upper-income households.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Take the matter at hand and deal with it,'' she said of the expiring tax cuts. ''End the high-end tax cuts. They are deepening the deficit. They are not creating jobs. They have to go.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats are clearly worried. Senate and House Democratic strategists say many of their candidates in tough races cannot win if the president loses, and they said Mr. Obama's message had drifted too often away from the economy toward issues intended to appeal to narrow groups, like the Violence Against Women Act, student loan subsidies and gay marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats said that Mr. Obama needed to refocus on job creation and amplify the message that much of his jobs program had been thwarted by Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He needs to call the Republicans out,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland. ''He needs to remind people he got zero help rescuing the economy when he came to office, and on these new jobs bills, the Republicans are simply trying to run out the clock.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said Mr. Obama would have to work harder to make his case that the economy was recovering, even if the recovery is less robust than everyone had hoped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is a contest of how we frame the economic question. The Republicans want to frame it one way; the White House wants to do it another way,'' Mr. Connolly said. ''There are going to be bumps along the way, no question about it. This month is a bump.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Democrats, seeking to amplify the White House message or keep it on track, have laid out their own plans to stay focused on jobs. This month, they will try to pass a tailored tax cut for small businesses that hire new workers or expand existing payrolls as a counter to a House-passed 20 percent tax cut for nearly all businesses. Then just before the July 4 recess, they will press for a measure to close off tax breaks they say benefit businesses that ship jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We want to see the response by our Republican colleagues,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''They blame the president for not creating jobs, then they block everything he proposes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some conservative Democrats are clearly shifting away from their leaders' agenda. Representative Jim Matheson of Utah, one of the most endangered Democratic incumbents this fall, said he would press to increase oil and gas production on federal lands, a crucial talking point of Republican leaders. And later this month, he is likely to vote for extension of all the Bush-era tax cuts that are set to expire Jan. 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Having more certainty would be much better for job creation,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The frustration extended beyond endangered conservatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We've really got ourselves to blame,'' said Jared Bernstein, former chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., referring to the gridlock between the White House and Congress. ''This could have been avoided if they took out some insurance against precisely this kind of anemic, fits-and-starts recovery,'' Mr. Bernstein said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Axelrod, a senior strategist for the Obama campaign, said Republicans risked ''overplaying their hand'' if they appeared to welcome bad news. But weak hiring, rising unemployment and a plunging stock market might as well have been heaven sent. Steven Law, the president of Crossroads GPS, a Republican ''super PAC'' working against Mr. Obama, said that in focus groups, swing voters who backed Mr. Obama in 2008 said they were already dubious about whether the president could do anything to repair the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Voters are near a point in concluding that President Obama simply can't get it done on the economy,'' Mr. Law said. ''If they conclude that, it becomes very hard to erase and even harder to paint his adversary as an unacceptable alternative.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dramatic drop-off in U.S. job growth has erased one of the few bright spots in the global economy, stoking fears that the world's major countries are inextricably linked in a downward spiral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Labor Department reported Friday that businesses created a meager 69,000 jobs last month - less than half what economists had expected. It was a sharp about-face from the start of the year, when hiring reached more than a quarter of a million jobs. The nation's unemployment rate also inched up to 8.2 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disappointing data came as Europe's financial crisis continued to worsen. The European Union said Friday that the unemployment rate in the 17-country euro zone rose to 11 percent in April. Meanwhile, a key measure of China's manufacturing sector showed it contracted in May.          &quot;There's no escaping the fact that just about everywhere you look there's a slowdown in global growth,&quot; said Dan North, North America chief economist for credit insurance firm Euler Hermes.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That became clear as stock markets across the world fell Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average erased its gains for the year, plummeting more than 2 percent. German markets dropped more than 3 percent, while Japan saw a 1 percent decline. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 3.8 percent to $83.23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fear that the world's biggest economies are headed toward a simultaneous slowdown drove investors to seek out the safest haven possible: 10-year U.S. Treasuries. Demand for these bonds pushed yields to a record low of 1.45 percent Friday - even lower than during the 2008 financial crisis. Meanwhile, the price of gold, another safe harbor, jumped 3.7 percent to more than $1,600 an ounce.&quot;We're essentially being held hostage to all these very real, very serious downside risks,&quot; said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group. &quot;No one quite knows how any of these risks are going to play out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weak jobs report also reverberated through the political arena, where the economy has become the foremost issue in the U.S. presidential campaign. GOP candidate Mitt Romney minced no words in criticizing President Obama's handling of the recovery, calling the data &quot;devastating news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          &quot;The president's reelection slogan may be 'forward,' but it seems like we've been moving backward,&quot; Romney said in a statement.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Minnesota, Obama pointed out that the country is still adding jobs but acknowledged that ramping up the pace of growth was challenging. He pointed to elevated gas prices that have chipped away at Americans' budgets and said the European fiscal crisis is casting a &quot;shadow&quot; over the U.S. economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We knew the road to recovery would not be easy,&quot; he said. &quot;We knew it would take time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists had hoped that lackluster job numbers in recent months were merely a statistical fluke caused by unseasonably warm winter weather, which  prompted businesses to hire people earlier than usual. But Friday's data suggested something more fundamental: Job growth is at its weakest level since last May, when the economy fell into a slump that lasted through the summer.That is likely to put pressure on the Federal Reserve to reconsider launching new measures to try to stimulate economic growth. With Congress gripped by partisan gridlock, the Fed is essentially the only government institution with the power to try to reduce unemployment. Lately, Fed officials have suggested they are not planning to do anything more, in large part because the economy seemed to be doing so much better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now the Fed may have to take another look at the question when officials gather for a policymaking meeting later this month. Many economists do not expect the Fed to take any new action then, but the central bank could set the stage for additional efforts later this summer if the economic recovery continues to be weak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the steps the Fed might take are a firm commitment to hold interest rates at extremely low levels for an even longer period - officials now project keeping them low through at least late 2014 - and a new round of Fed purchases of Treasury bonds or mortgage-backed securities - &quot;quantitative easing,&quot; in Fedspeak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say the country needs to add roughly 130,000 jobs per month for the recovery to maintain its momentum. But to truly make a dent in the unemployment rate, hiring must reach a sustained rate of 250,000 jobs a month. The country has hit that mark only three times over the past year and a half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a tease,&quot; said Keith Hall, a senior research fellow at George Mason University and former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. &quot;It just didn't last.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, the health-care and transportation sectors each hired more than 30,000 people, the most of any industry. But those gains were offset by a sharp drop in construction jobs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists said a small increase in the number of people who are now looking for work also helped drive up the unemployment rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were small rays of optimism, however. The government also reported that consumer spending rose by 0.3 percent in April and that incomes increased 0.2 percent. Automakers announced strong May sales, with Chrysler up 30 percent in the United States. Ford and General Motors also posted double-digit gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          But that was not enough to dispel the fog of uncertainty over the direction of the recovery. Carl Camden, chief executive of Kelly Services, a global staffing firm, said businesses will only hire when they are confident that demand will emerge to support those jobs.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to worries over Europe, he said his clients remain concerned about domestic issues such as health-care costs and what the presidential election will mean for taxes and government spending cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very few companies are willing to take money and invest in the future now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Friday disclosed selling his stakes in dozens of companies over the past year, including investments in several overseas companies that might have undermined his increasingly tough campaign vows to create American jobs and crack down on foreign competitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ohio and other battleground states, Romney is making an aggressive appeal to working-class voters by promising to punish China for alleged currency manipulation and violations of intellectual property protections and other laws. Criticism of President Obama's handling of trade issues also is part of Romney's offensive.          The new disclosure report shows that Romney has sold all of his private, independently owned stock in foreign companies. But he still has a stake in foreign companies through investments in Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded in Boston in 1984. Citing Bain confidentiality requirements, Romney has declined to disclose the nature of those investments.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sales included shares in Chinese real estate and educational firms and in Wal-Mart de Mexico, which has come under scrutiny amid bribery allegations. Romney also sold stock in dozens of name-brand U.S. firms, including McDonald's, Google, Apple and JPMorgan Chase, the records show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said that the Romney family's assets &quot;are managed on a blind basis&quot; by a Boston-based attorney. &quot;They do not control the investment of these assets, which are under the control and overall management of a trustee,&quot; Saul said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If elected, Romney would be among the wealthiest individuals ever to win the presidency, with a net worth estimated in the report of up to $255 million. The overall figures are little changed from what Romney reported last year             .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          In records submitted to the Office of Government Ethics, presidential candidates must provide only broad value ranges for their holdings, making determination of a precise net worth impossible. Forbes magazine recently estimated Romney's net worth at $230 million, while his campaign characterized the amount at $190 million to $250 million.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and the first lady, Michelle, reported assets worth between $2.6 million and $8.3 million in a personal finance disclosure filed last month. The couple had up to $1 million in a JPMorgan asset management account; $1 million to $5 million in U.S. Treasury notes; and a mortgage of between $500,000 and $1 million on their Chicago home.Romney's personal wealth has become a regular point of debate in the 2012 presidential contest, in part because of attacks by Republican primary opponents and the Obama campaign on Romney's history as a leveraged buyout specialist. Romney has defended his private equity career as a way of creating jobs and has accused Obama of attacking free markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has several holdings linked to major political donors, including stock in Marriott International, where Romney served as a director. Marriott International's chairman, J.W. &quot;Bill&quot; Marriott Jr., and his brother, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts chief Richard Marriott, have contributed $1 million each to Restore Our Future, a super PAC dedicated to helping Romney win the White House. Romney also has more than $1 million invested with the firm run by hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer, who has hosted fundraisers for Romney and has given $1 million to Restore Our Future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Romney reported receiving $189,000 in 2011 for four speeches, including $68,000 each for addresses to Goldentree Asset Management and the International Franchise Association. Romney prompted jeers from Democrats in January when he described $374,000 in earlier speaking fees as &quot;not very much&quot; money.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disclosure shows that Romney's stock sales included up to $15,000 in Wal-Mart's Mexican affiliate, which was the focus of a New York Times report in April alleging that the Arkansas-based retail giant  failed to report millions of dollars in payments to Mexican officials to aid the brand's expansion in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new disclosure report also shows that Romney sold holdings in several companies based in China, including Hang Lung Properties, a Hong Kong real estate firm that owns properties in Hong Kong and on the mainland. The company is chaired by entrepreneur Ronnie C. Chan, who served as a trustee of the University of Southern California and as a director of several companies, including Enron at the time of its collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney also sold stock in New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group, a provider of private educational services in China. The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and reports having more than 20,000 employees. In addition, he sold his stake in the holding company for the stock exchange of Hong Kong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the latest disclosures, much of Romney's wealth remains hidden because of an obscure exception in federal ethics law that allows him to avoid revealing the extent of his investments.The Romney campaign has long characterized his holdings as being managed by a blind trust. But the Romney trust does not meet federal standards for independence, meaning he is supposed to disclose all assets in that trust, including underlying holdings, according to legal experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, however, has cited Bain's confidentiality requirement in declining to identify his underlying holdings with the firm. His trustee, Brad Malt, a Boston attorney working for the law firm that represents Bain, said in a news briefing last year that he did not receive investment instructions from Romney but that he sold some holdings that he thought might conflict with Romney's views as a presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dramatic drop-off in U.S. job growth has erased one of the few bright spots in the global economy, stoking fears that the world's major countries are inextricably linked in a downward spiral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Labor Department reported Friday that businesses created a meager 69,000 jobs last month - less than half what economists had expected. It was a sharp about-face from the start of the year, when hiring reached more than a quarter of a million jobs. The nation's unemployment rate also inched up to 8.2 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disappointing data came as Europe's financial crisiscontinued to worsen. The European Union said Friday that the unemployment ratein the 17-country euro zone rose to 11 percent in April. Meanwhile, a key measure of China's manufacturing sector showed it contracted in May. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no escaping the fact that just about everywhere you look there's a slowdown in global growth,&quot; said Dan North, North America chief economist for credit insurance firm Euler Hermes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That became clear as stock markets across the world fell Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average erased its gains for the year, plummeting more than 2 percent. German markets dropped more than 3 percent, while Japan saw a 1 percent decline. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 3.8 percent to $83.23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fear that the world's biggest economies are headed toward a simultaneous slowdown drove investors to seek out the safest haven possible: 10-year U.S. Treasuries. Demand for these bonds pushed yields to a record low of 1.45 percent Friday - even lower than during the 2008 financial crisis. Meanwhile, the price of gold, another safe harbor, jumped 3.7 percent to more than $1,600 an ounce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're essentially being held hostage to all these very real, very serious downside risks,&quot; said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group. &quot;No one quite knows how any of these risks are going to play out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weak jobs report also reverberated through the political arena, where the economy has become the foremost issue in the U.S. presidential campaign. GOP candidate Mitt Romney minced no words in criticizing President Obama's handling of the recovery, calling the data &quot;devastating news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president's reelection slogan may be 'forward,' but it seems like we've been moving backward,&quot; Romney said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Minnesota, Obama pointed out that the country is still adding jobs but acknowledged that ramping up the pace of growth was challenging. He pointed to elevated gas prices that have chipped away at Americans' budgets and said the European fiscal crisis is casting a &quot;shadow&quot; over the U.S. economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We knew the road to recovery would not be easy,&quot; he said. &quot;We knew it would take time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists had hoped that lackluster job numbers in recent months were merely a statistical fluke caused by unseasonably warm winter weather, which prompted businesses to hire people earlier than usual. But Friday's data suggested something more fundamental: Job growth is at its weakest level since last May, when the economy fell into a slump that lasted through the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is likely to put pressure on the Federal Reserve to reconsider launching new measures to try to stimulate economic growth. With Congress gripped by partisan gridlock, the Fed is essentially the only government institution with the power to try to reduce unemployment. Lately, Fed officials have suggested they are not planning to do anything more, in large part because the economy seemed to be doing so much better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now the Fed may have to take another look at the question when officials gather for a policymaking meeting later this month. Many economists do not expect the Fed to take any new action then, but the central bank could set the stage for additional efforts later this summer if the economic recovery continues to be weak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the steps the Fed might take are a firm commitment to hold interest rates at extremely low levels for an even longer period - officials now project keeping them low through at least late 2014 - and a new round of Fed purchases of Treasury bonds or mortgage-backed securities - &quot;quantitative easing,&quot; in Fedspeak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say the country needs to add roughly 130,000 jobs per month for the recovery to maintain its momentum. But to truly make a dent in the unemployment rate, hiring must reach a sustained rate of 250,000 jobs a month. The country has hit that mark only three times over the past year and a half.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, however, has cited Bain's confidentiality requirement in declining to identify his underlying holdings with the firm. His trustee, Brad Malt, a Boston attorney working for the law firm that represents Bain, said in a news briefing last year that he did not receive investment instructions from Romney but that he sold some holdings that he thought might conflict with Romney's views as a presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A report in The New York Times is the latest evidence that Mr. Obama has embraced the use of his predecessor's national security and anti-terrorism machinery. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelation that President Obama has been personally and secretly directing a covert cyberwar against Iran could have political implications as the president enters the final stretch of his re-election campaign against Mitt Romney this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report in The New York Times is the latest evidence that Mr. Obama has embraced the use of his predecessor's national security and anti-terrorism machinery, decisions that some of his liberal supporters have viewed as a misguided and hawkish approach to foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the news also complicates the political strategy for Republicans, including Mr. Romney, who are trying to build a case against Mr. Obama as a feckless, indecisive foreign policy leader, citing in particular the humanitarian crises in Libya and Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That case may be more difficult to make against a president who has once again pushed the envelope for waging covert operations abroad. In in this instance, the target was Iran, a country against which Republicans have been urging the administration to take stronger and more decisive action. Last year, Mr. Romney accused Mr. Obama of being &quot;weak and timid&quot; with Iran for not reacting more strongly when a United States drone crashed in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, the news of Mr. Obama's cyber war against Iran comes a day after the president stood shoulder to shoulder with George W. Bush in the White House as the official portrait of Mr. Bush, the 43rd president, was unveiled. Mr. Obama praised Mr. Bush and joked that he &quot;left me a really good TV sports package&quot; in the White House. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It turns out, Mr. Bush also left behind a secret computer virus that Mr. Obama used to try and cripple Iran's nuclear program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times report portrays Mr. Obama as personally engaged in the decision to use the virus, which was eventually called Stuxnet, to slow Iran's progress and destroy its nuclear enrichment equipment. The virus was developed during Mr. Bush's time in office, but its use continued and expanded under Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From his first months in office, President Obama secretly ordered increasingly sophisticated attacks on the computer systems that run Iran's main nuclear enrichment facilities, significantly expanding America's first sustained use of cyberweapons, according to participants in the program,&quot; the article, by David Sanger, says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the second Times story in a week to provide a behind-the-scenes look at the president's direct involvement in covert decisions abroad. A story on Tuesday by Jo Becker and Scott Shane described Mr. Obama's role in deciding what terrorists to put on a &quot;kill list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;kill list&quot; story prompted predictable outrage from some of Mr. Obama's staunchest supporters, who have long complained that anti-war rhetoric he expressed during the 2008 campaign has given way to a hawkish policy in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has put a prettier and more palatable face on extremely ugly policies,&quot; Glenn Greenwald, of Salon Magazine, wrote this week. &quot;Many Obama fans claimed during the 2008 election that his background as a constitutional lawyer would ensure reversal of the most extremist Bush/Cheney policies, but he has instead used that background for the opposite goal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberals have not always been unhappy with the president. In his first days in office, Mr. Obama banned interrogation techniques that his supporters deemed tantamount to torture and he ordered the closure of the detention facility at Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba, within a year, although he failed to follow through in the face of Congressional opposition. Later in his presidency, he followed through on a promise to end the war in Iraq by the conclusion of 2011. Both moves earned him praise from his base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his decision to increase the number of troops in Afghanistan by 30,000 was viewed by some liberals as a betrayal, even though Mr. Obama had said during the 2008 campaign that the war in that country was the right one to be fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And his willingness to dramatically increase the use of drones for targeted assassinations of terrorist figures has strained his credibility among those who view such tactics as the work of the neoconservative hawks who surrounded Mr. Bush in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the killing of Osama bin Laden, which was widely supported by members of both political parties, made some progressives queasy because of its implications for defining the executive powers of the presidency to order an assassination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the same actions by Mr. Obama that anger liberals could also help insulate him from the &quot;weak on defense&quot; political attacks that Republicans have historically leveled against Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney and his fellow Republicans have accused the president of not being aggressive enough with Iran, Syria and other adversaries. They have said he should have done more to support an uprising in Iran two years ago. And they accuse Mr. Obama of not doing enough in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's lack of leadership has resulted in a policy of paralysis that has watched Assad slaughter 10,000 individuals,&quot; Mr. Romney said this week, calling for the United States and its allies to provide weapons to the Syrian opposition forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign has already begun to use the killing of Osama bin Laden as a political tool, questioning in an ad about the president's leadership whether Mr. Romney would have made the decision to authorize the raid in Pakistan during which Bin Laden was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, the president's allies could use the stories from this week - Mr. Obama's role in assembling a terrorist &quot;kill list&quot; and his involvement in authorizing cyber warfare - to challenge the idea that his foreign policy is characterized by paralysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney is likely to remain primarily about the economy and how to fix it. But foreign policy and national security issues will help shape how both men are perceived as leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And events in the world  - including in Iran and Syria - could heighten voter interest in how both men will use the country's national security apparatus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6:53 p.m. Updated The Fox News Channel came under withering criticism on Wednesday for a four-minute video broadcast on its morning show ''Fox &amp; Friends'' that portrayed President Obama's tenure as a series of failed promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video had most of the hallmarks of a campaign attack ad, except that it was produced and paid for by a news network rather than a candidate or a political action committee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A blogger on the conservative Web site Hot Air wrote of the video on Wednesday afternoon, ''It makes a pretty powerful argument against another four years of Barack Obama, but that shouldn't be the job of news-reporting organizations, even when we like the message.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Zurawik, a television critic for The Baltimore Sun, wrote, ''Even I am shocked by how blatantly Fox is throwing off any pretense of being a journalistic entity with videos like this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Fox &amp; Friends'' has been described by Fox public relations executives in the past as an entertainment show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years it has had an obviously conservative tilt, with near-constant criticism of Mr. Obama and other Democrats. It was on ''Fox &amp; Friends'' that Mr. Obama was falsely reported to have attended an Islamic madrasa school while living in Indonesia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ''Fox &amp; Friends'' also includes news elements and interviews, and Wednesday's video, titled ''Four Years of Hope and Change,'' was preceded by a graphic that read ''America's Election Headquarters,'' Fox's name for its election news coverage. The video itself showed changes in the debt, the jobless rate, food prices, gas prices and other economic measurements, combined with spliced quotes from Mr. Obama and his critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The Impact of the President's First Term,'' read a graphic on the bottom of the screen after the video. The co-anchors of ''Fox &amp; Friends'' congratulated a producer, Chris White, for compiling the video, which noticeably did not include any positive measurements of Mr. Obama's tenure as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video was broadcast one day after Mitt Romney officially secured the Republican nomination for president, having picked up the necessary number of delegates after a long primary campaign season. Asked whether the Obama campaign viewed the Fox video as a Romney campaign ad in disguise, a spokesman declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Fox News, which is run by the former Republican strategist Roger Ailes, did not respond to requests for interviews. However, when asked about Mr. Ailes, she said, ''Roger was not aware of the video. ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blog TVNewser quoted a statement it said was from Bill Shine, the executive vice president of programming for Fox News: ''The package that aired on 'Fox &amp; Friends' was created by an associate producer and was not authorized at the senior executive level of the network. This has been addressed with the show's producers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In past interviews, current and former Fox employees have described Mr. Ailes as keenly interested in the content of ''Fox &amp; Friends,'' which has an agenda-setting function since it starts off the network's day of programming. The people said Mr. Ailes regularly contributed talking points and phoned in ideas for the show, sometimes when it was on the air between 6 and 9 a.m. on weekdays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of what they called possible retaliation by the network. Fox executives have publicly ridiculed employees in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Versions of the video were taken off of the network's Web sites Wednesday afternoon. Earlier in the day, The Fox Nation, a conservative arm of FoxNews.com, promoted it as a ''must-see Fox video,'' though now that URL leads to a dead link. Though Fox pulled the video, copies remained on YouTube and other sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media Matters for America, a liberal nonprofit group that monitors Fox programming and mounts anti-Fox campaigns, asserted that the video may have violated one of the policies of the network's parent company, News Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy in question states that ''we do not donate any corporate money, services, products or facilities to any political party, candidate or political committee'' unless approved by the company's government relations office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The ad presented on 'Fox &amp; Friends' was virtually indistinguishable from the sort of campaign videos regularly produced by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's campaign, the Republican National Committee or Fox News analyst Karl Rove's American Crossroads,'' Media Matters stated. ''Those videos at least provide a disclaimer noting their affiliation with a campaign or other sort of political committee.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fox video started with a graphic that read, ''Fox &amp; Friends Presents.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;To encourage political participation, it's time to allow people to give money to campaigns by text message. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of campaign finance laws and regulation is to promote confidence in government and to encourage people to engage in the political process. This mission is being advanced in a new way by states on opposite coasts, California and Maryland. The California Fair Political Practices Commission and the Maryland State Board of Elections, two independent state agencies that oversee campaign finance, recently approved first-in-the-nation rules permitting low-dollar text message contributions to political campaigns. Our agencies recognize that technological advances have opened the door for unparalleled involvement in public life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text-message political giving has the potential to transform the political process by democratizing fund-raising. Perhaps most important, it is one way to encourage grass-roots participation in political campaigns. People tend to have a greater sense of personal involvement in the issues in an election if they have made a contribution, even if it's a small one. This connection can lead to increased civic engagement and ultimately a more robust democracy. Increased participation by many small contributors is also one way to counter the effect of big money in politics. Encouraging grass-roots giving is sorely needed in an election season where there is unlimited independent spending through &quot;super PACs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text donations have become a major, if not a required, tool to raise money and awareness. The fund-raising efforts for relief after the earthquake in Haiti and the tsunami in Japan proved that such giving can make a difference. The ability to instantly text donations to relief agencies resulted not only in a groundswell of donations, but increased public awareness and concern for the devastating situation in those nations. Of the $255 million the Red Cross received for Haiti relief and recovery efforts in the month after the quake, more than $32 million was pledged when people texted &quot;Haiti&quot; to 90999 to donate $10.&nbsp;At certain points, text donations came in at a rate of $200,000 per hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When people give even a small amount of money, they pay more attention. They feel a personal connection. That connection results in more involvement in issues generally. More than half of the donors surveyed by the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project made text message contributions to other disaster relief efforts after their Haiti donation. And just under half of them encouraged their friends or family members to make similar contributions using their cellphones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans have embraced mobile communications devices and use them for everything from voting for their favorite contestant on &quot;American Idol&quot; to buying a latte. Cellphones now accommodate all manner of commercial transactions. But we still have no app to be able to exercise our First Amendment right to send some money to a political candidate or a ballot measure committee. Often backed by one industry, union or wealthy individual, California's ballot measures deal with controversial issues like immigration, marriage rights and health care.&nbsp;People would be able to be directly involved in these issues in an unprecedented way if they were able to text-message contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people in this country are disengaged from the political process. Trust in government is low and a large part of the population does not vote. Since 1980, voter turnout in presidential election years has hovered between 50 to 57 percent.&nbsp;Yet recent grass-roots movements have had a profound effect on politics at the national level.&nbsp;In the 2008 presidential election, for example, the Obama campaign reported that 90 percent of its donors gave $100 or less and 41 percent gave $25 or less.&nbsp;In the 2010 midterm elections, Tea Party-endorsed candidates topped the list of grass-roots fund-raisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Permitting text contributions will encourage participation in political processes by a new generation as well as by those who have been traditionally uninvolved. There are many people, young and old, who are not accustomed to writing contribution checks and certainly are not likely to attend a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser.&nbsp;The ease of mobile contributions and the fact that more and more Americans have smartphones and not land lines would allow those who may be inspired by a candidate or cause to send $5 or $10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea is simple.&nbsp;You text a number code or click a link on your smartphone saying you'll make a $5 or $10 contribution to a candidate.&nbsp;This is a pledge or an &quot;opt-in&quot; until it is paid. The contribution charge appears on your monthly cellphone bill where you can review and pay it. Parents whose kids have texted contributions on a family plan can pay the charge or delete it from the bill. After subscribers pay their phone bills, a data aggregator - a firm that handles mobile transactions - collects the donations from the wireless phone company and directs them to the candidate's political committee, which receives and reports the contributions.&nbsp;Text giving programs are often capped at $30 per phone number. (Texting donations&nbsp;&nbsp;involve cellphone users' being cold-called by political fund-raisers; this is already prohibited by F.C.C. rules.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California and Maryland's new regulations permit the wireless carriers, aggregators and political committees to meet disclosure requirements and to make a profit. But in this election cycle, people are not able to take advantage of text-message contributing because wireless carriers have not yet made it available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wireless carriers have expressed three objections. First, that text contributions may give the appearance that a carrier endorses or is affiliated with a particular candidate, perhaps one with extreme views. No company wants to be associated with a neo-Nazi party or to be forced to give them a text number by law. The extremist issue is a non-starter because none of the regulations or laws will ever force a company to engage its services against its will. The aggregators can require that candidates be bona fide and on the ballot, as they require that charities who participate in their text giving programs be legitimate. Fund-raising has been around since there have been elections, and so have extreme candidates. Cellphone users are sophisticated enough to distinguish between a political candidate and their wireless carrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, carriers do not want any additional responsibilities placed on them by regulations.&nbsp;There is no merit to their concern because under California and Maryland's new regulations, the legal responsibility is on the  to ensure that contributions are properly disclosed, not on the wireless carriers or aggregators. Third, the wireless carriers are not certain that the political text contributions will be profitable enough. This objection will be addressed through the market as candidates compete for broad access to text contributions, and does not justify limiting the use of mobile phones as a tool for civic engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another obstacle to implementation of text donations has been the lack of support from federal regulators and other states. It is imperative that regulators in the campaign finance arena not block the potential for technology to increase the involvement of citizens in the political process. The Federal Election Commission, which had turned down a request to permit text donations in 2010, is considering the issue again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Republican and a Democratic political consulting firm, together with a leading aggregator for wireless carriers, filed a request that the F.E.C. will consider next week to approve a new program of mobile text contributions. In what one F.E.C. commissioner quipped may be the &quot;last time they agree,&quot; the Obama for America and Romney for President campaigns both urge the F.E.C. to support the text donation proposal. They believe it will encourage small donor participation and is the modern equivalent of &quot;pass the hat&quot; fund-raising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an era of increasing influence by large political donors, regulators and wireless carriers should do more to facilitate participation by the little guy. End the blackout on small text donations. Do you agree? Text (1) for support and (2) for no.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Carolina legislators voted Wednesday to reopen an ethics investigation into whether Gov.Nikki Haley, right, illegally lobbied fellow politicians while she was a state representative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Haley, a high-profile Republican and a vocal supporter ofMitt Romney's presidential campaign who has been discussed as a potential vice-presidential candidate, has denied any wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five Republicans and one Democrat on the House Ethics Committee voted unanimously to investigate an accusation that Ms. Haley lobbied for a hospital and an engineering firm while serving in the State House. She represented Lexington County from 2005 to 2010, when she was elected governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The politically charged complaint was brought by John Rainey, a longtime Republican activist who is being represented at Ethics Committee hearings by the chairman of the state Democratic Party, Richard A. Harpootlian. It alleges that Ms. Haley lobbied lawmakers and state health officials while working for the Lexington Medical Health Center Foundation and for Wilbur Smith Associates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethics Committee opened an investigation this month into Mr. Rainey's complaint, then quickly dismissed the charges. Mr. Rainey appealed. At the hearing Wednesday, the lawmakers said there were too many unanswered questions about Ms. Haley's conduct, according to The State newspaper. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the course of the Republican primary campaign, Mitt Romney took pains to convince socially conservative activists that he believes in them, understands their passions and would be an advocate for their causes in the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Planned Parenthood is unveiling one of its biggest-ever political advertising campaigns aimed at using Mr. Romney's own words to undermine his support among women - a critical voter group among whom he already trails President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new ad that will run in three battleground states, the political arm of the women's health care organization accuses Mr. Romney of wanting to deny women access to birth control, abortions and equal pay for the work they do. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When Mitt Romney says, 'Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of that,''' the ad says, ''Romney is saying he'll deny women the birth control and cancer screenings they depend on.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That statement can be misleading. Mr. Romney was answering a question about what federal funding he would target for elimination or reductions if he is elected. His campaign has said he wants to end federal funding of Planned Parenthood, not the organization itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But officials at the Planned Parenthood Action Fund said women understand the context of his remarks. They said the group is spending $1.4 million to run the ad in West Palm Beach, Fla., Des Moines, Iowa, and the suburbs of northern Virginia, as well as in Washington. That represents a threefold increase over the group's total spending during the 2008 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is just the beginning,'' said Dawn Laguens, the group's executive vice president for communications. ''This is a very small down payment on what we intend to do to make sure people are very clear where the candidates stand.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign comes in the wake of Planned Parenthood's successful pressure campaign to win reversal of a cut in funding by the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation earlier this year. And it comes as Planned Parenthood and other liberal organizations see an opportunity in the statements Mr. Romney made during the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney opposed the president's efforts to compel religious institutions to provide insurance coverage for contraception. He supported a ''parenthood'' measure in Mississippi that critics contend would ban birth control. And he has said he believes Roe v. Wade should be overturned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign has seized on Mr. Romney's statements to try and drive a wedge between the Republican and women, many of whom live in battleground states that will decide the election this November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buoyed by polls that show Mr. Obama already has a significant edge over Mr. Romney among women, the Democratic campaign and its allies are hoping to maintain or even extend that lead. The Planned Parenthood ad fits into that strategy. The group will officially endorse Mr. Obama on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mitt Romney has been much clearer and more direct even than John McCain in his interest in dismantling women's health care,'' Ms. Laguens said. ''The threats have intensified. The Republican primary laid bare and made clear what their agenda is.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign has responded by focusing its efforts on the economic plight that confronts many women. Mr. Romney has argued that 92 percent of the people who lost jobs under the president's watch were women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That statistic ignores the fact that the economic downturn affected men more severely in the months before Mr. Obama took office. But Mr. Romney's advisers believe he can appeal to women by appealing to their sense of dismay about their financial futures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They go for security. They are looking for security more so than men,'' Bay Buchanan, an adviser to Mr. Romney, said of women in a conference call with reporters in March. ''I think that Mitt Romney is going to be able to make a very strong case that we need these jobs. Women will understand that more than anybody.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials at Planned Parenthood dismiss those arguments. The organization conducted several focus groups with women during the past several months to fine-tune their political message. Geoff Garin, the group's pollster, said showing the ad had ''jaw-dropping'' effects on the women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They thought he was far more extreme and ideological than they suspected that he might be,'' Mr. Garin said. ''In an election that is very likely to be won or lost with the votes of women, this ad and this whole campaign is very powerful.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the focus groups of 500 swing women voters in battleground states, Mr. Garin said many voters did not know much about Mr. Romney's positions on issues of particular interest to women. After viewing the Planned Parenthood ad, the women were twice as likely to say Mr. Romney was ''out of step'' with women's issues, Mr. Garin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's a feeling that the election hangs in the balance based on the women's vote, beyond what was true even in 2008,'' he said. ''The stakes are much higher.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stakes are high for both presidential campaigns as well. Efforts by groups like Planned Parenthood will be especially important for Mr. Obama if they help him maintain his lead among women by warning that Mr. Romney represents a threat to their issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Romney's campaign will be just as aggressive in the days ahead, pushing its own narrative about how women have fared during Mr. Obama's presidency. And ''super PACs'' backing Mr. Romney will no doubt join the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women ad wars are just beginning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOUISA, Ky. -- For generations, coal has been king in this Appalachian town. It provided heat, light and jobs for the hundreds of people who worked in the nearby coal mines and the smoke-coughing Big Sandy power plant that burned their black bounty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, coal is in a corner. Across the United States, the industry is under siege, threatened by new regulations from Washington, environmentalists fortified by money from Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor of New York City, and natural gas companies intent on capturing much of the nation's energy market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when the operator of the Big Sandy plant announced last year that it would be switching from coal to cleaner, cheaper natural gas, people here took it as the worst betrayal imaginable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Have you lost your mind?'' State Representative Rocky Adkins, a Democrat and one of Kentucky's most powerful politicians, thundered at Michael G. Morris, the chairman of the plant's operator, American Electric Power, during an encounter last summer. ''You cannot wave the white flag and let the environmentalists and regulators declare victory here in the heart of coal country.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coal and electric utilities, long allied, are beginning to split. More than 100 of the 500 or so coal-burning power plants in the United States are expected to be shut down in the next few years. While coal still provides about a third of the nation's power, just four years ago it was providing nearly half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decline is largely because new pollution rules have made coal plants more costly, while a surge in production of natural gas through the process of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, has sent gas prices plummeting. Together, the economics of coal have been transformed after a century of dominance in Washington, state capitals and the board rooms of electric utilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The math screams at you to do gas,'' said Mr. Morris, whose company is the nation's largest consumer of coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental groups, after years of targeting coal plants as leading sources of air pollution, have moved in for the kill. ''We never thought we would get to a place where coal plants are falling so fast,'' said Bruce Nilles, the director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal initiative. It has been aided by $50 million from Mr. Bloomberg, who views the campaign as part of a public health effort, and $26 million from an odd bedfellow: the top official of a natural gas company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The environmentalists figure that if they can shut down a third of the nation's coal burning plants by 2020, emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States could be cut at least as much as they would have under a landmark 2009 climate bill that died in Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the coal industry is mustering all the weapons it can: lobbying, legislation, litigation and a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign trumpeting the benefits of ''clean coal.'' The fight has even become an issue in the presidential campaign, with the industry blaming President Obama and the Environmental Protection Agency for the onslaught, and Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, hinting that he would roll back some of the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in Kentucky, the intervention by Mr. Adkins and other coal industry advocates has saved coal at Big Sandy, at least temporarily. American Electric Power, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, is proposing a $1 billion retrofit to allow the plant to continue burning coal and has asked Kentucky regulators to approve a 30 percent increase in electricity rates to pay for the work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that request, which will come up for a vote by the state's utility commission within the next week, has inspired resistance from some residents, large industrial companies that consume much of Kentucky's electricity and even the state attorney general's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressured on the domestic front, some giant American coal producers, like Arch Coal and Peabody Energy, are shifting their attention to markets overseas, where coal-fired power plants are being built faster than they are being abandoned in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if Big Sandy continues to eat up 90 rail cars of coal a day, the industry's decline is evident here. Sales to Midwestern power plants have slumped, as has the market price of coal, dropping so suddenly that many local mines are cutting back hours or closing. A warm winter, decreasing demand, only made matters worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I call it the imperfect storm,'' Mr. Adkins said. ''And it is breaking the back of our local economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Coordinated Effort</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anger toward Washington is palpable in this impoverished corner of Eastern Kentucky, where miners display bumper stickers or license plates on their pickup trucks with slogans like ''Coal Keeps the Lights On'' or ''If Obama Is the Answer, How Stupid Was the Question?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard to find anyone here who does not feel affected by the fate of Big Sandy. Just as the smokestack at the plant towers over the countryside, Big Sandy dominates much of life here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Danny Sartin, 61, a barrel-chested heavy equipment operator at the plant, said his father, grandfathers and uncles all worked in local mines that feed Big Sandy. ''Coal and the coal mining industry, it's all we have ever known,'' Mr. Sartin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of that coal comes from the Licking River mine, about 50 miles south of Big Sandy, where miners rip apart hillsides to reach vast seams just below the surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Lacy, 41, an executive at Licking River Resources Inc., said layoffs among his 350 miners -- in Magoffin County, where unemployment is already 17.5 percent -- are inevitable if the coal furnaces at Big Sandy go cold. Even the garden supply company that Mr. Lacy's father-in-law owns and where his two sons work indirectly relies on Big Sandy, because mines are required to plant grass over the scarred earth they leave behind. ''It is the ripple effect that comes right through us,'' Mr. Lacy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Channeling the animosity toward Washington and fears about their livelihoods, coal producers, union leaders, landowners and railroads came together to pressure American Electric Power to back down on its plan to close the coal furnaces at Big Sandy. They have leaned on county judges, state legislators and other politicians to attempt to silence public criticism of the 30 percent electricity rate increase and to pressure the Kentucky Public Service Commission to approve the retrofit project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saving coal, they argued, justified the rate increase, which would cost the average residential customer about $472 a year in addition to the typical $1,580 annual bill today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I will grant you it is going to cost a lot of money to retrofit that plant,'' said Nick Carter, the president of a company that represents landowners whose properties hold billions of tons of coal reserves. ''But how many teachers will be laid off and how many churches will have to close if Big Sandy stops burning coal?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Dee's Drive Inn Restaurant, a fixture on Main Street in Louisa, the patrons are split.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fred Klinebriel, 58, a disabled former steelworker, said his father was a mine worker and his brother a trucker who moved coal. But if keeping coal means an even bigger electric bill, he is not sure it is worth it. ''I am up against the wall right now as it is,'' he said. ''I guess you are damned if you do and damned if you don't -- or at least we are here in coal country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Issues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What went largely unspoken in the dozens of pages of e-mails, letters and other pitches these players have churned out in the fight to keep the plant open were the perils of coal, which extend far beyond mine accidents and black lung disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Big Sandy plant spews tens of thousands of tons of pollutants each year into the region's air, including sulfur dioxide and smaller amounts of mercury, which can cause health problems like respiratory illnesses and possibly developmental disabilities among children. Many of these pollutants would be significantly reduced with the retrofit, but the plant would continue to be a major source of carbon dioxide, which is blamed for global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big Sandy also maintains a sprawling coal ash pit near the plant, created to store waste ash after the coal is burned, that the E.P.A. recently listed as one of 45 ''high hazard'' pits nationwide. That means it ''will probably cause loss of human life,'' the E.P.A. says, if a serious accident occurs. In Tennessee in 2008, a billion gallons of slurry from a coal ash pit washed out area homes and streams, though no deaths resulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, federal regulators have accused the owners of Licking River of dumping debris, known as spoil, from another nearby mine into a local valley, harming wildlife and an intermittent local stream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lacy, the Licking River executive, says such concerns are overblown. Instead, he talks of a conspiracy by environmentalists and the Obama administration to destroy the way of life here in Kentucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I at least have to give them some credit,'' he said. ''It has been well played on their part, very methodical, step by step.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the regulations the industry finds objectionable, though, had their origins in a Republican administration. In 1990, President George Bush proposed and Congress approved sweeping revisions to the Clean Air Act, authorizing the E.P.A. to regulate emissions of mercury, arsenic and other toxic airborne chemicals. The agency determined in 2000 that it had the power to limit such emissions from power plants, but a weak rule issued under the second Bush administration was successfully challenged in court by environmental advocates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration, acting under court order, issued new standards in December that would require more emissions reductions by all but the top-performing plants. Gina McCarthy, the director of the Office of Air and Radiation at the E.P.A., said that accusations of collusion between the agency and environmental advocates were unfounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Coal will continue to be a large part of electric generation in this country for a long time,'' Ms. McCarthy said in an interview. ''I just hope it is cleaner.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lacy is hardly convinced. As he drove through the Licking River mine during a shift change one recent afternoon, his face reddened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If they keep this up, the people who live here are going to have to move somewhere else, like during the Depression,'' he said. ''This place is suffering in a bad way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlikely Allies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tacked up on the wall in a cramped office in Columbus, Ohio, that serves as the Midwest headquarters for the Sierra Club is a map of the United States with the headline ''Coal Plants Under Target.'' Dozens of color-coded pins form a giant U shape -- from Minnesota, south to Missouri, east to Kentucky and then up to Ohio -- with each marking a plant that the Sierra Club is determined to shut down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, the group filed lawsuits to try to force utilities or federal regulators to comply with pollution-control laws and organized public opinion campaigns to try to block the construction of plants. But the change in the energy marketplace has given the environmentalists an extraordinary new weapon: the pocketbooks of consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The coal industry used to be able to get away with murder, here in Ohio and throughout Appalachia,'' said Nachy Kanfer, 27, a Sierra Club organizer. ''Not anymore.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late April, Mr. Kanfer and other Sierra Club staff members traveled to Kentucky to testify before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. They argued that American Electric Power should not be allowed to retrofit Big Sandy -- an argument they are making in many states -- because there are less expensive alternatives to deliver power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, the Sierra Club and other environmental groups are also pressing local officials in metropolitan areas to help shut down coal-burning power plants. In Chicago, for example, Mayor Rahm Emanuel recently announced that the city's last two coal-fired plants would close in 2014, four years earlier than expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most important early allies in this fight was Aubrey K. McClendon, the chief executive of Chesapeake Energy, who donated $26 million starting in 2007 to help the Sierra Club with its campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company also donated millions of dollars more to the American Lung Association, which used the money, in part, to run ''Fighting for Air'' television commercials. Some of the most recent ads in the campaign feature a baby coughing, wheezing and then crying while sitting outside a coal-fired power plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sierra Club came under attack from other environmental activists for accepting money from Mr. McClendon, whose company has a financial interest in killing off its competition but burns a fossil fuel itself. Mr. Nilles, the director of Beyond Coal, now views it as a mistake. ''We would not do it again,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other deep-pocketed donors have stepped in, including Mr. Bloomberg, whose intervention has infuriated Kentucky officials like Mr. Adkins, the legislator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mayor Bloomberg should stay in that high-rise condo or his mansions,'' Mr. Adkins said, ''and eat his caviar while we keep his lights on in New York City.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big Coal has hardly conceded defeat in this multifront war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry has increased political campaign contributions in the last four years to historic levels, with 80 percent of those donations going to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Companies like Arch Coal, which used to spend only about $100,000 a year on lobbyists in Washington, invested $5.7 million to push its case during the first three years of the Obama administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even as American Electric Power plans to close 5 of its 21 coal-burning plants and rely much more on natural gas, it still intends to retrofit 12 plants. That means it will be burning coal for years to come. A rise in natural gas prices could also slow the decline of coal as a power source. So the company has joined with old allies in Washington to try to delay the new rules and block any future ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry and its supporters have also gone to court, filing lawsuits challenging E.P.A. rules that limit pollution from coal-burning plants from crossing state lines and the mountaintop mining rules that are holding up new permits in Kentucky and West Virginia -- legal fights that the industry has had some success with so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the regional agency that coordinates electric power delivery in the mid-Atlantic and the Midwest cannot wait for the battles to be resolved. This month, it auctioned off the rights for utility companies to supply electricity that will be needed to make up for what is lost through coal plant retirements. Most of the new power is fueled by natural gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's an unprecedented transition,'' said Michael J. Kormos, senior vice president for operations at PJM Interconnection, the regional group that coordinates power delivery for 60 million people in 13 states. ''But whatever happens, we have to make sure we keep the lights on.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A look at David Plouffe's plan to paint Mitt Romney as an &quot;avatar of revanchism.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks ago, I had a back-and-forth with The New Republic's Alec MacGillis over whether it was fair to suggest (as I had) that the Obama White House would much rather talk about social issues&nbsp;like the contraception mandate, the DREAM Act, and even gay marriage than about the economy and jobs. As an exhibit for my side of the argument, I'd like to submit this passage from John Heilemann's New York piece this week on the Obama campaign's plans for going negative against Mitt Romney:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the Obamans certainly hit John McCain hard four years ago-running more negative ads than any campaign in history-what they intend to do to Romney is more savage. They will pummel him for being a vulture-vampire capitalist at Bain Capital. They will pound him for being a miserable failure as the governor of Massachusetts. They will mash him for being a water-carrier for Paul Ryan's Social Darwinist fiscal program. They will maul him for being a combination of Jerry Falwell, Joe Arpaio, and John Galt on a range of issues that strike deep chords with the Obama coalition. &quot;We're gonna say, 'Let's be clear what he would do as president,' &quot; Plouffe explains. &quot;Potentially abortion will be criminalized. Women will be denied contraceptive services. He's far right on immigration. He supports efforts to amend the Constitution to ban gay marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama effort at disqualifying Romney will go beyond painting him as excessively conservative, however. It will aim to cast him as an avatar of revanchism. &quot;He's the fifties, he is retro, he is backward, and we are forward-that's the basic construct,&quot; says a top Obama strategist. &quot;If you're a woman, you're Hispanic, you're young, or you've gotten left out, you look at Romney and say, 'This [expletive] guy is gonna take us back to the way it always was, and guess what? I've never been part of that.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social issues strategy isn't the only component discussed here, obviously, but it's clearly the one that Heilemann's White House sources are most enthusiastic about, and the one that they're most intent on using to define Romney. This is exactly the kind of thinking I had in mind when I suggested&nbsp;that &quot;at times, the Obama White House seems to be attempting to run a liberal version of George H. W. Bush's 1988 campaign, which used cultural arguments to delegitimize Michael Dukakis.&quot; In their vision of Mitt Romney, Retro Man and &quot;avatar of revanchism,&quot; Plouffe and Co. plainly think that they have a winning left-of-center equivalent of the kind of&nbsp;&quot;latte-drinking, sushi-eating, Volvo-driving&quot;&nbsp;stereotypes that conservatives deployed against culturally-liberal Democrats between the McGovern and Obama eras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The obvious problem with this strategy, as I've written before, is that cultural arguments tend to play poorly in recession-era elections - as Bush the elder discovered in 1992. The deeper problem, though, is that conservative culture war arguments have traditionally been most effective when they're attached to something more significant than just the iconography of identity politics - the&nbsp;lattes and sushi and Volvos, the perfidies of the Hollywood-media elite, and so on. The sex-and-marriage tangle of culture war issues mattered because American family structures broke down dramatically from the 1970s onward. The race-and-crime tangle mattered because crime rates went sky-high in the same period (and then those issues declined in salience as those same crime rates declined). Controversies ranging from immigration to affirmative action mattered because they played into white working class fears about wage stagnation and job loss, making it seem like while they were playing by the rules, their own government was taking sides against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the question for the Obama campaign is whether any of&nbsp;&nbsp;social issues have a similar resonance in the current political atmosphere. Are American swing voters deeply worried about contraceptive access, for instance, and ready to believe that a Mitt Romney administration would imperil their ability to plan and space their children? If so, then the &quot;war on women&quot; framing could be a winner for the White House. If not, though, then the Obama camp's fixation on Mitt Romney, avatar of social reaction, could turn out to be a lot like the right-wing fixation on Barack Obama, radical socialist and crypto-Weatherman, during the 2008 campaign&nbsp;- a narrative that just makes the people pushing it look out-of-touch with the prevailing political and economic landscape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's something I wrote about&nbsp;the right's William Ayers fixation&nbsp;during the '08 campaign that might have some relevance today:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  when I listen to Republicans talk about &quot;taking the gloves off&quot; where Barack Obama's relationship to William Ayers is concerned, I hear the sound of conservative failure - the sound, say, of the 1992 campaign, when George H.W. Bush went to the culture-war well in the midst of a recession and ended up losing to a philandering draft-dodger even so. The Ayers connection is completely fair game for the McCain campaign, as is the Jeremiah Wright connection: Both are windows into the political world Barack Obama moved in, and the &quot;no enemies to the left&quot; caution with which he navigated Chicago politics. I tend to think that both connections tell you a little more about Obama's tendency to be accommodating, and to tack with the prevailing political winds which ever way they blow, than they do about his own innermost convictions - I think he's more of a &quot;go along, get along&quot; guy than a crypto-socialist - but reasonable people can disagree on this point, and either way the connections are perfectly appropriate material for talking points, speeches and campaign ads. (And yes, by the same token, there's nothing unfair or dirty about the Obama campaign raising some of McCain's dubious past associations either.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bill Ayers can't win you an election - he can't come anywhere close, in fact - because unlike Willie Horton, Bill Ayers isn't tied to any of the issues that are uppermost in voters' minds. He tells you something about Obama's judgment, maybe, and his ideological biases, maybe - and yes, yes, with enough innuendo and doomy music,&nbsp;you can imply&nbsp;that he tells you something about Obama's softness on Islamist terrorism as well. But think about the directness of&nbsp;the Willie Horton ad.&nbsp;Think about the directness of&nbsp;[Jesse Helms'] &quot;white hands&quot; ad.&nbsp;you&nbsp;And then think about the implications of any Ayers ad the McCain team could cut.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Obama White House, the danger of the social issues strategy as outlined above is that it sends the following message.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Brooks: Gail, people are always asking me who is going to win the election. They must know I don't have a clue. I think they just want to hear me say that their favorite candidate is going to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail Collins: Wow, almost nobody asks me who's going to win. Mostly people just want to talk about the dog on the roof of Romney's car. I wonder if I'm being marginalized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David:&nbsp;I could bring joy to the world if I told Democrats that Obama is surely going to win and Republicans that it's certain to be Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But of course the code of the columnist dictates that my job is not to bring joy. It's to bring anger, frustration, depression and torpor. So let me say to you that I think Romney is more likely to win. My thinking is this: If nothing happens in Europe, then the odds are 50-50. But there's a strong chance that something very, very bad is going to happen to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: I'm averse to placing odds unless we're talking about the Belmont Stakes, which I do think is going to be won by I'll Have Another, the horse that won the Preakness and Kentucky Derby. Do you know how often horses win the Derby and the Preakness and then flop in the Belmont? Constantly! But then we forget and the next year we're excited about the Triple Crown again. This is actually the only thing I know about horse racing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I'm sorry, you were talking about Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David:&nbsp;There are a number of compelling people who are predicting Eurodoom over the next few months, but this Huffington Post piece by Simon Johnson and Peter Boone pretty well captures the full horror. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: I always appreciate the way you bring reading material to our discussions. Have you noticed the way I try to express my gratitude by providing historical context whenever when we're discussing political sex scandals?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: Separately, Mark Cliffe, the head of ING Financial Markets Research, forecasts that if the Greeks can leave the euro in an orderly way, then the recession in Europe will slow American growth to about 1.3 percent in 2012 and 1.7 percent in 2013. If the Greek departure is messier, spilling over to other countries and maybe the collapse of the whole project, then euro zone G.D.P. would fall by 9 percent the first year and the United States would be back in recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either scenario would swamp the presidential race. That is to say, Barack Obama could run the most brilliant campaign ever and it would still be swept away by the economic slide. No fault of his own. That's just the way the cookie crumbles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: It is possible that Europe will struggle through. Also, that it will be terrible for Europe but not as bad as expected for us. Also, we could discover someone on the Romney team was trying to corner the market on drachmas. I'm just saying that all kinds of outside events could have an impact on the presidential election, but there's no point in worrying about them until they happen. We have more than five months to go. Barack Obama might personally attack and subdue a terrorist hijacker, saving an entire airplane full of people. Although since he isn't allowed to fly commercial, the people getting saved would mainly be members of the media, which could dilute the national celebration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: But in the meantime, we have to go around pretending that the tactics, strategies and statements of the various campaigns matter. So I wanted to ask you about two salient issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: Is either going to be about politicians' sex lives or the dog Mitt Romney put on the roof of his car? Because there are days when I begin to wonder if those are my only areas of expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David:&nbsp;The first comes from a quotation in John Heilemann's well-reported piece in New York magazine on Obama's plans for his re-election race. One of Obama's election gurus puts it well. Romney is &quot;the fifties, he is retro, he is backward, and we are forward - that's the basic construct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: I'm not sure they ought to run against the '50s. It was a tough time for women but really easy to get a job. Did you know that back then, newspaperswould for reporters?&nbsp; And there was no such thing as an unpaid internship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: Let me just note that the Obama campaign can't figure out a theme. Romney's the '50s, but he's also a modern financier. He's an opportunist who flip-flops but he's also a right-wing extremist in thrall to right-wing extremists? Obama flip-flops on Romney the way Romney flip-flops on health care reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: I see a fairly consistent thought. Mitt is the opportunist who would happily turn himself into a right-wing extremist if it would get him elected. And I don't think you can discount the Bain Capital angle. Making unsuccessful companies efficient and successful is good. Buying loser companies, saddling them with debt and then walking off with a huge profit while the company expires like a beached flounder is bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: Personally, I agree that Romney is sort of '50s. He's like Austin Powers, only from 1952. I've always thought the big electoral problem with his Mormonism is not Joseph Smith, it's the Osmonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Donny and Marie, he's counter-cultural. He doesn't seem to have experienced the cultural shift of the last few decades. No Lenny Bruce, no Richard Pryor, no Letterman, Seinfeld, Jay-Z or &quot;The View.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: Do you think Mitt sees reruns of &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; when he closes his eyes? Or maybe it's &quot;I Led Three Lives&quot;? That was the McCarthy-era TV series about Herbert Philbrick &quot;who for nine frightening years did lead three lives - citizen, Communist and counterspy.&quot; Maybe that would explain Mitt's conviction, against all rational evidence, that our greatest peril lies in Mother Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: My question is: Is this good or bad? People turn back the clock all the time. Look at the Renaissance. Are Americans so disturbed that they want to reclaim a little wholesomeness, while obviously not turning their backs on the progress we've made on race, gender, cosmopolitanism and all the rest?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: Not totally sure about the '50s wholesomeness. At least part of it was a national agreement not to talk about the unpleasantness that might be going on all about one. And to show all married couples sleeping in separate beds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: I think they might like a dose of retro-values. They'll eventually hear that Romney is the kind of guy who left his son's wedding reception early so he could bring food to someone who was recovering from breast cancer. If it's policy, then no one wants to go back to the '50s. If it's values, people might like that kind of back to basics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: Well, I totally reject the idea that it isn't 21st century to bring food to a sick friend. And when it comes to Romney's '50s-type behavior, there's also the time he tried to pressure a single woman into giving up her unborn baby for adoption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: The other large question is whether Obama's shift from hope to fear is a good thing. As Heilemann puts it, &quot;For anyone still starry-eyed about Obama, the months ahead will provide a bracing revelation about what he truly is: not a savior, not a saint, not a man above the fray, but a brass-knuckled, pipe-hitting, red-in-tooth-and-claw brawler determined to do what is necessary to stay in power-in other words, a politician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: Poor guy. When he goes all positive and hope-y, his base demands to know when he's going to get in there and fight. When he fights, he's lost his positive message. I don't think it's possible for a presidential candidate to have a successful campaign strategy in June, because whatever he's doing, we in the opining class will say it's wrongheaded. Because, you know, we've still got five months of talking to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: I understand why they are making this shift. But I think it's a mistake. They are neutralizing Obama's best asset - that he is different, authentic and personally admirable. Besides, I can't think of anybody who was elected with one persona and then re-elected with a completely opposite persona. It will creep people out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: I think you're exaggerating the persona shift. But I've got a funny feeling we'll be seeing many, many Baracks and Mitts before this one is over. We just need to calm down and enjoy the summer. Plenty of time to go crazy about your favored candidate's strategy in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: So this is what we have to look forward to. A Republican candidate who is the second coming of Perry Como, a Democrat who is the personification of cage-match fighting, and it will all be determined by a bunch of spendthrift Greeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: This sounds like a great script. Maybe we could sell it to HBO. Or make them all superheroes and put it in 3-D.&nbsp; Robert Downey Jr. can play the Democrat. You pick the Republican. Maybe Gwyneth Paltrow as Angela Merkel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">360 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;There is no state in the country where it's possible to work a 40-hour week at minimum wage and afford a two-bedroom apartment. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of its 2012 report on rent affordability, the National Low Income Housing Coalition released a chart that's been floating around the Internet. It shows that there isn't a single state in the country where it's possible to work 40 hours per week at minimum wage and afford a two-bedroom apartment at Fair Market Rent. In West Virginia and Arkansas, you'd need to work at least a 63-hour week, and that's as good as it gets. In California, Maryland, D.C., New Jersey and New York you'd need to work 130 hours or more. Hawaii comes in last place: 175 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can anticipate a few no-big-deal arguments, starting with the definition of affordability. The Coalition calculates the amount an individual must earn to afford a 2-bedroom unit according to the area's Fair Market Rent-which means paying no more than 30 percent of income for housing costs (rent and utilities). And why a two-bedroom apartment, as opposed to a one-bedroom?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both of these choices seem reasonable to me. Thirty percent is a generally accepted standard, and there are plenty of single-parent households as well as families where, for various reasons, only one member is able to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even if you quibble with how exactly the Coalition put the chart together, it's clear that there's a mismatch between the minimum wage and the cost of living (or at least a decent cost of living). In New York, which is in the midst of a fight over raising the minimum wage, two individuals would need to work 68 hours a week each to manage the rent on a two-bedroom unit. If they have kids, the 70 percent of their paychecks left after rent won't get them very far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he was campaigning for the presidency, Mr. Obama promised to raise the federal minimum wage annually. That hasn't happened. It's the same as it was in January of 2009: $7.25 an hour. According to Bloomberg View, that amount, adjusted for inflation, &quot;is actually lower than what a minimum-wage worker earned in 1968.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somehow I doubt Mitt Romney will highlight this particular broken promise in an attack ad, but that's no reason for anyone else to give the president a pass.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A Fox and Friends &quot;news segment&quot; looks an awful lot like a super PAC attack ad.&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hardly controversial to say that Fox News serves the Republican agenda. Certainly there's a rightward slant to their commentary programs, which I actually think is fine. (The Times opinion section generally has a leftward slant.) What's problematic is that their opinion and news offerings are often indistinguishable, leading to accusations of bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, though, Fox News went way beyond bias to outright political advocacy with a four minute &quot;news segment&quot; on the morning show Fox and Friends that closely resembles an attack ad from a super PAC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a litany of familiar Republican talking-points set to dramatic music with alarming graphics about joblessness and the national debt (which, by the way predates Mr. Obama's spending programs.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's little to distinguish the video from a political spot-except that it didn't play during a commercial break. Fox and Friends co-host Gretchen Carlson introduced it. Afterward, she and the other hosts cheered the producer who &quot;has been in a small editing room for the last couple of weeks&quot; working on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wonder if the Romney campaign has to report the attack ad - I mean, news video - as an in-kind contribution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6:53 p.m. | Updated The Fox News Channel came under withering criticism on Wednesday for a four-minute video broadcast on its morning show &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; that portrayed President Obama's tenure as a series of failed promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video had most of the hallmarks of a campaign attack ad, except that it was produced and paid for by a news network rather than a candidate or a political action committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A blogger on the conservative Web site Hot Air wrote of the video on Wednesday afternoon, &quot;It makes a pretty powerful argument against another four years of Barack Obama, but that shouldn't be the job of news-reporting organizations, even when we like the message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Zurawik, a television critic for The Baltimore Sun, wrote, &quot;Even I am shocked by how blatantly Fox is throwing off any pretense of being a journalistic entity with videos like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; has been described by Fox public relations executives in the past as an entertainment show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years it has had an obviously conservative tilt, with near-constant criticism of Mr. Obama and other Democrats. It was on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; that Mr. Obama was falsely reported to have attended an Islamic madrasa school while living in Indonesia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; also includes news elements and interviews, and Wednesday's video, titled &quot;Four Years of Hope and Change,&quot; was preceded by a graphic that read &quot;America's Election Headquarters,&quot; Fox's name for its election news coverage.<BR><BR>The video itself showed changes in the debt, the jobless rate, food prices, gas prices and other economic measurements, combined with spliced quotes from Mr. Obama and his critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Impact of the President's First Term,&quot; read a graphic on the bottom of the screen after the video. The co-anchors of &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; congratulated a producer, Chris White, for compiling the video, which noticeably did not include any positive measurements of Mr. Obama's tenure as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video was broadcast one day after Mitt Romney officially secured the Republican nomination for president, having picked up the necessary number of delegates after a long primary campaign season. Asked whether the Obama campaign viewed the Fox video as a Romney campaign ad in disguise, a spokesman declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Fox News, which is run by the former Republican strategist Roger Ailes, did not respond to requests for interviews. However, when asked about Mr. Ailes, she said, &quot;Roger was not aware of the video. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blog TVNewser quoted a statement it said was from Bill Shine, the executive vice president of programming for Fox News: &quot;The package that aired on 'Fox &amp; Friends' was created by an associate producer and was not authorized at the senior executive level of the network. This has been addressed with the show's producers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In past interviews, current and former Fox employees have described Mr. Ailes as keenly interested in the content of &quot;Fox &amp; Friends,&quot; which has an agenda-setting function since it starts off the network's day of programming. The people said Mr. Ailes regularly contributed talking points and phoned in ideas for the show, sometimes when it was on the air between 6 and 9 a.m. on weekdays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of what they called possible retaliation by the network. Fox executives have publicly ridiculed employees in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Versions of the video were taken off of the network's Web sites Wednesday afternoon. Earlier in the day, The Fox Nation, a conservative arm of FoxNews.com, promoted it as a &quot;must-see Fox video,&quot; though now that URL leads to a dead link. Though Fox pulled the video, copies remained on YouTube and other sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media Matters for America, a liberal nonprofit group that monitors Fox programming and mounts anti-Fox campaigns, asserted that the video may have violated one of the policies of the network's parent company, News Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy in question states that &quot;we do not donate any corporate money, services, products or facilities to any political party, candidate or political committee&quot; unless approved by the company's government relations office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ad presented on 'Fox &amp; Friends' was virtually indistinguishable from the sort of campaign videos regularly produced by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's campaign, the Republican National Committee or Fox News analyst Karl Rove's American Crossroads,&quot; Media Matters stated. &quot;Those videos at least provide a disclaimer noting their affiliation with a campaign or other sort of political committee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fox video started with a graphic that read, &quot;Fox &amp; Friends Presents.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Planned Parenthood is unveiling one of its biggest-ever political advertising campaigns aimed at using Mitt Romney's own words to undermine his support among women. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the course of the Republican primary campaign, Mitt Romney took pains to convince socially conservative activists that he believes in them, understands their passions and would be an advocate for their causes in the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Planned Parenthood is unveiling one of its biggest-ever political advertising campaigns aimed at using Mr. Romney's own words to undermine his support among women - a critical voter group among whom he already trails President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new ad that will run in three battleground states, the political arm of the women's health care organization accuses Mr. Romney of wanting to deny women access to birth control, abortions and equal pay for the work they do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Mitt Romney says, 'Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of that,'&quot; the ad says, &quot;Romney is saying he'll deny women the birth control and cancer screenings they depend on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That statement can be misleading. Mr. Romney was answering a question about what federal funding he would target for elimination or reductions if he is elected. His campaign has said he wants to end federal funding of Planned Parenthood, not the organization itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But officials at the Planned Parenthood Action Fund said women understand the context of his remarks. They said the group is spending $1.4 million to run the ad in West Palm Beach, Fla., Des Moines, Iowa, and the suburbs of northern Virginia, as well as in Washington. That represents a threefold increase over the group's total spending during the 2008 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just the beginning,&quot; said Dawn Laguens, the group's executive vice president. &quot;This is a very small down payment on what we intend to do to make sure people are very clear where the candidates stand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign comes in the wake of Planned Parenthood's successful pressure campaign to win reversal of a cut in funding by the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation earlier this year. And it comes as Planned Parenthood and other liberal organizations see an opportunity in the statements Mr. Romney made during the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney opposed the president's efforts to compel religious institutions to provide insurance coverage for contraception. He supported a &quot;parenthood&quot; measure in Mississippi that critics contend would ban birth control. And he has said he believes Roe v. Wade should be overturned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign has seized on Mr. Romney's statements to try and drive a wedge between the Republican and women, many of whom live in battleground states that will decide the election this November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buoyed by polls that show Mr. Obama already has a significant edge over Mr. Romney among women, the Democratic campaign and its allies are hoping to maintain or even extend that lead. The Planned Parenthood ad fits into that strategy. The group will officially endorse Mr. Obama on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney has been much clearer and more direct even than John McCain in his interest in dismantling women's health care,&quot; Ms. Laguens said. &quot;The threats have intensified. The Republican primary laid bare and made clear what their agenda is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign has responded by focusing its efforts on the economic plight that confronts many women. Mr. Romney has argued that 92 percent of the people who lost jobs under the president's watch were women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That statistic ignores the fact that the economic downturn affected men more severely in the months before Mr. Obama took office. But Mr. Romney's advisers believe he can appeal to women by appealing to their sense of dismay about their financial futures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They go for security. They are looking for security more so than men,&quot; Bay Buchanan, an adviser to Mr. Romney, said of women in a conference call with reporters in March. &quot;I think that Mitt Romney is going to be able to make a very strong case that we need these jobs. Women will understand that more than anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials at Planned Parenthood dismiss those arguments. The organization conducted several focus groups with women during the past several months to fine-tune their political message. Geoff Garin, the group's pollster, said showing the ad had &quot;jaw-dropping&quot; effects on the women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They thought he was far more extreme and ideological than they suspected that he might be,&quot; Mr. Garin said. &quot;In an election that is very likely to be won or lost with the votes of women, this ad and this whole campaign is very powerful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the focus groups of 500 swing women voters in battleground states, Mr. Garin said many voters did not know much about Mr. Romney's positions on issues of particular interest to women. After viewing the Planned Parenthood ad, the women were twice as likely to say Mr. Romney was &quot;out of step&quot; with women's issues, Mr. Garin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a feeling that the election hangs in the balance based on the women's vote, beyond what was true even in 2008,&quot; he said. &quot;The stakes are much higher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stakes are high for both presidential campaigns as well. Efforts by groups like Planned Parenthood will be especially important for Mr. Obama if they help him maintain his lead among women by warning that Mr. Romney represents a threat to their issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Romney's campaign will be just as aggressive in the days ahead, pushing its own narrative about how women have fared during Mr. Obama's presidency. And &quot;super PACs&quot; backing Mr. Romney will no doubt join the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women ad wars are just beginning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- This was the enemy, served up in the latest chart from the intelligence agencies: 15 Qaeda suspects in Yemen with Western ties. The mug shots and brief biographies resembled a high school yearbook layout. Several were Americans. Two were teenagers, including a girl who looked even younger than her 17 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama, overseeing the regular Tuesday counterterrorism meeting of two dozen security officials in the White House Situation Room, took a moment to study the faces. It was Jan. 19, 2010, the end of a first year in office punctuated by terrorist plots and culminating in a brush with catastrophe over Detroit on Christmas Day, a reminder that a successful attack could derail his presidency. Yet he faced adversaries without uniforms, often indistinguishable from the civilians around them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''How old are these people?'' he asked, according to two officials present. ''If they are starting to use children,'' he said of Al Qaeda, ''we are moving into a whole different phase.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not a theoretical question: Mr. Obama has placed himself at the helm of a top secret ''nominations'' process to designate terrorists for kill or capture, of which the capture part has become largely theoretical. He had vowed to align the fight against Al Qaeda with American values; the chart, introducing people whose deaths he might soon be asked to order, underscored just what a moral and legal conundrum this could be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is the liberal law professor who campaigned against the Iraq war and torture, and then insisted on approving every new name on an expanding ''kill list,'' poring over terrorist suspects' biographies on what one official calls the macabre ''baseball cards'' of an unconventional war. When a rare opportunity for a drone strike at a top terrorist arises -- but his family is with him -- it is the president who has reserved to himself the final moral calculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He is determined that he will make these decisions about how far and wide these operations will go,'' said Thomas E. Donilon, his national security adviser. ''His view is that he's responsible for the position of the United States in the world.'' He added, ''He's determined to keep the tether pretty short.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing else in Mr. Obama's first term has baffled liberal supporters and confounded conservative critics alike as his aggressive counterterrorism record. His actions have often remained inscrutable, obscured by awkward secrecy rules, polarized political commentary and the president's own deep reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In interviews with The New York Times, three dozen of his current and former advisers described Mr. Obama's evolution since taking on the role, without precedent in presidential history, of personally overseeing the shadow war with Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They describe a paradoxical leader who shunned the legislative deal-making required to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, but approves lethal action without hand-wringing. While he was adamant about narrowing the fight and improving relations with the Muslim world, he has followed the metastasizing enemy into new and dangerous lands. When he applies his lawyering skills to counterterrorism, it is usually to enable, not constrain, his ferocious campaign against Al Qaeda -- even when it comes to killing an American cleric in Yemen, a decision that Mr. Obama told colleagues was ''an easy one.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His first term has seen private warnings from top officials about a ''Whac-A-Mole'' approach to counterterrorism; the invention of a new category of aerial attack following complaints of careless targeting; and presidential acquiescence in a formula for counting civilian deaths that some officials think is skewed to produce low numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration's failure to forge a clear detention policy has created the impression among some members of Congress of a take-no-prisoners policy. And Mr. Obama's ambassador to Pakistan, Cameron P. Munter, has complained to colleagues that the C.I.A.'s strikes drive American policy there, saying ''he didn't realize his main job was to kill people,'' a colleague said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beside the president at every step is his counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, who is variously compared by colleagues to a dogged police detective, tracking terrorists from his cavelike office in the White House basement, or a priest whose blessing has become indispensable to Mr. Obama, echoing the president's attempt to apply the ''just war'' theories of Christian philosophers to a brutal modern conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the strikes that have eviscerated Al Qaeda -- just since April, there have been 14 in Yemen, and 6 in Pakistan -- have also tested both men's commitment to the principles they have repeatedly said are necessary to defeat the enemy in the long term. Drones have replaced Guantanamo as the recruiting tool of choice for militants; in his 2010 guilty plea, Faisal Shahzad, who had tried to set off a car bomb in Times Square, justified targeting civilians by telling the judge, ''When the drones hit, they don't see children.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dennis C. Blair, director of national intelligence until he was fired in May 2010, said that discussions inside the White House of long-term strategy against Al Qaeda were sidelined by the intense focus on strikes. ''The steady refrain in the White House was, 'This is the only game in town' -- reminded me of body counts in Vietnam,'' said Mr. Blair, a retired admiral who began his Navy service during that war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Blair's criticism, dismissed by White House officials as personal pique, nonetheless resonates inside the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William M. Daley, Mr. Obama's chief of staff in 2011, said the president and his advisers understood that they could not keep adding new names to a kill list, from ever lower on the Qaeda totem pole. What remains unanswered is how much killing will be enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''One guy gets knocked off, and the guy's driver, who's No. 21, becomes 20?'' Mr. Daley said, describing the internal discussion. ''At what point are you just filling the bucket with numbers?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Maintain My Options'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A phalanx of retired generals and admirals stood behind Mr. Obama on the second day of his presidency, providing martial cover as he signed several executive orders to make good on campaign pledges. Brutal interrogation techniques were banned, he declared. And the prison at Guantanamo Bay would be closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the new president did not say was that the orders contained a few subtle loopholes. They reflected a still unfamiliar Barack Obama, a realist who, unlike some of his fervent supporters, was never carried away by his own rhetoric. Instead, he was already putting his lawyerly mind to carving out the maximum amount of maneuvering room to fight terrorism as he saw fit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a pattern that would be seen repeatedly, from his response to Republican complaints that he wanted to read terrorists their rights, to his acceptance of the C.I.A.'s method for counting civilian casualties in drone strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day before the executive orders were issued, the C.I.A.'s top lawyer, John A. Rizzo, had called the White House in a panic. The order prohibited the agency from operating detention facilities, closing once and for all the secret overseas ''black sites'' where interrogators had brutalized terrorist suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The way this is written, you are going to take us out of the rendition business,'' Mr. Rizzo told Gregory B. Craig, Mr. Obama's White House counsel, referring to the much-criticized practice of grabbing a terrorist suspect abroad and delivering him to another country for interrogation or trial. The problem, Mr. Rizzo explained, was that the C.I.A. sometimes held such suspects for a day or two while awaiting a flight. The order appeared to outlaw that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Craig assured him that the new president had no intention of ending rendition -- only its abuse, which could lead to American complicity in torture abroad. So a new definition of ''detention facility'' was inserted, excluding places used to hold people ''on a short-term, transitory basis.'' Problem solved -- and no messy public explanation damped Mr. Obama's celebration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Pragmatism over ideology,'' his campaign national security team had advised in a memo in March 2008. It was counsel that only reinforced the president's instincts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before he was sworn in, Mr. Obama's advisers had warned him against taking a categorical position on what would be done with Guantanamo detainees. The deft insertion of some wiggle words in the president's order showed that the advice was followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some detainees would be transferred to prisons in other countries, or released, it said. Some would be prosecuted -- if ''feasible'' -- in criminal courts. Military commissions, which Mr. Obama had criticized, were not mentioned -- and thus not ruled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for those who could not be transferred or tried but were judged too dangerous for release? Their ''disposition'' would be handled by ''lawful means, consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few sharp-eyed observers inside and outside the government understood what the public did not. Without showing his hand, Mr. Obama had preserved three major policies -- rendition, military commissions and indefinite detention -- that have been targets of human rights groups since the 2001 terrorist attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a year later, with Congress trying to force him to try all terrorism suspects using revamped military commissions, he deployed his legal skills differently -- to preserve trials in civilian courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was shortly after Dec. 25, 2009, following a close call in which a Qaeda-trained operative named Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab had boarded a Detroit-bound airliner with a bomb sewn into his underwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama was taking a drubbing from Republicans over the government's decision to read the suspect his rights, a prerequisite for bringing criminal charges against him in civilian court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president ''seems to think that if he gives terrorists the rights of Americans, lets them lawyer up and reads them their Miranda rights, we won't be at war,'' former Vice President Dick Cheney charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sensing vulnerability on both a practical and political level, the president summoned his attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">F.B.I. agents had questioned Mr. Abdulmutallab for 50 minutes and gained valuable intelligence before giving him the warning. They had relied on a 1984 case called New York v. Quarles, in which the Supreme Court ruled that statements made by a suspect in response to urgent public safety questions -- the case involved the location of a gun -- could be introduced into evidence even if the suspect had not been advised of the right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, who Mr. Holder said misses the legal profession, got into a colloquy with the attorney general. How far, he asked, could Quarles be stretched? Mr. Holder felt that in terrorism cases, the court would allow indefinite questioning on a fairly broad range of subjects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Satisfied with the edgy new interpretation, Mr. Obama gave his blessing, Mr. Holder recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Barack Obama believes in options: 'Maintain my options,' '' said Jeh C. Johnson, a campaign adviser and now general counsel of the Defense Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They Must All Be Militants'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same mind-set would be brought to bear as the president intensified what would become a withering campaign to use unmanned aircraft to kill Qaeda terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just days after taking office, the president got word that the first strike under his administration had killed a number of innocent Pakistanis. ''The president was very sharp on the thing, and said, 'I want to know how this happened,' '' a top White House adviser recounted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to his concern, the C.I.A. downsized its munitions for more pinpoint strikes. In addition, the president tightened standards, aides say: If the agency did not have a ''near certainty'' that a strike would result in zero civilian deaths, Mr. Obama wanted to decide personally whether to go ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's directive reinforced the need for caution, counterterrorism officials said, but did not significantly change the program. In part, that is because ''the protection of innocent life was always a critical consideration,'' said Michael V. Hayden, the last C.I.A. director under President George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also because Mr. Obama embraced a disputed method for counting civilian casualties that did little to box him in. It in effect counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants, according to several administration officials, unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counterterrorism officials insist this approach is one of simple logic: people in an area of known terrorist activity, or found with a top Qaeda operative, are probably up to no good. ''Al Qaeda is an insular, paranoid organization -- innocent neighbors don't hitchhike rides in the back of trucks headed for the border with guns and bombs,'' said one official, who requested anonymity to speak about what is still a classified program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This counting method may partly explain the official claims of extraordinarily low collateral deaths. In a speech last year Mr. Brennan, Mr. Obama's trusted adviser, said that not a single noncombatant had been killed in a year of strikes. And in a recent interview, a senior administration official said that the number of civilians killed in drone strikes in Pakistan under Mr. Obama was in the ''single digits'' -- and that independent counts of scores or hundreds of civilian deaths unwittingly draw on false propaganda claims by militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in interviews, three former senior intelligence officials expressed disbelief that the number could be so low. The C.I.A. accounting has so troubled some administration officials outside the agency that they have brought their concerns to the White House. One called it ''guilt by association'' that has led to ''deceptive'' estimates of civilian casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It bothers me when they say there were seven guys, so they must all be militants,'' the official said. ''They count the corpses and they're not really sure who they are.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'A No-Brainer'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About four months into his presidency, as Republicans accused him of reckless naivete on terrorism, Mr. Obama quickly pulled together a speech defending his policies. Standing before the Constitution at the National Archives in Washington, he mentioned Guantanamo 28 times, repeating his campaign pledge to close the prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was too late, and his defensive tone suggested that Mr. Obama knew it. Though President George W. Bush and Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican candidate, had supported closing the Guantanamo prison, Republicans in Congress had reversed course and discovered they could use the issue to portray Mr. Obama as soft on terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walking out of the Archives, the president turned to his national security adviser at the time, Gen. James L. Jones, and admitted that he had never devised a plan to persuade Congress to shut down the prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're never going to make that mistake again,'' Mr. Obama told the retired Marine general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Jones said the president and his aides had assumed that closing the prison was ''a no-brainer -- the United States will look good around the world.'' The trouble was, he added, ''nobody asked, 'O.K., let's assume it's a good idea, how are you going to do this?' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not only Mr. Obama's distaste for legislative backslapping and arm-twisting, but also part of a deeper pattern, said an administration official who has watched him closely: the president seemed to have ''a sense that if he sketches a vision, it will happen -- without his really having thought through the mechanism by which it will happen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, both Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the attorney general, Mr. Holder, had warned that the plan to close the Guantanamo prison was in peril, and they volunteered to fight for it on Capitol Hill, according to officials. But with Mr. Obama's backing, his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, blocked them, saying health care reform had to go first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the administration floated a plan to transfer from Guantanamo to Northern Virginia two Uighurs, members of a largely Muslim ethnic minority from China who are considered no threat to the United States, Virginia Republicans led by Representative Frank R. Wolf denounced the idea. The administration backed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That show of weakness doomed the effort to close Guantanamo, the same administration official said. ''Lyndon Johnson would have steamrolled the guy,'' he said. ''That's not what happened. It's like a boxing match where a cut opens over a guy's eye.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Use of Force</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the strangest of bureaucratic rituals: Every week or so, more than 100 members of the government's sprawling national security apparatus gather, by secure video teleconference, to pore over terrorist suspects' biographies and recommend to the president who should be the next to die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This secret ''nominations'' process is an invention of the Obama administration, a grim debating society that vets the PowerPoint slides bearing the names, aliases and life stories of suspected members of Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen or its allies in Somalia's Shabab militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video conferences are run by the Pentagon, which oversees strikes in those countries, and participants do not hesitate to call out a challenge, pressing for the evidence behind accusations of ties to Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What's a Qaeda facilitator?'' asked one participant, illustrating the spirit of the exchanges. ''If I open a gate and you drive through it, am I a facilitator?'' Given the contentious discussions, it can take five or six sessions for a name to be approved, and names go off the list if a suspect no longer appears to pose an imminent threat, the official said. A parallel, more cloistered selection process at the C.I.A. focuses largely on Pakistan, where that agency conducts strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nominations go to the White House, where by his own insistence and guided by Mr. Brennan, Mr. Obama must approve any name. He signs off on every strike in Yemen and Somalia and also on the more complex and risky strikes in Pakistan -- about a third of the total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides say Mr. Obama has several reasons for becoming so immersed in lethal counterterrorism operations. A student of writings on war by Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, he believes that he should take moral responsibility for such actions. And he knows that bad strikes can tarnish America's image and derail diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He realizes this isn't science, this is judgments made off of, most of the time, human intelligence,'' said Mr. Daley, the former chief of staff. ''The president accepts as a fact that a certain amount of screw-ups are going to happen, and to him, that calls for a more judicious process.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the control he exercises also appears to reflect Mr. Obama's striking self-confidence: he believes, according to several people who have worked closely with him, that his own judgment should be brought to bear on strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what surprised him most about Mr. Obama, Mr. Donilon, the national security adviser, answered immediately: ''He's a president who is quite comfortable with the use of force on behalf of the United States.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, in a 2007 campaign speech in which he vowed to pull the United States out of Iraq and refocus on Al Qaeda, Mr. Obama had trumpeted his plan to go after terrorist bases in Pakistan -- even if Pakistani leaders objected. His rivals at the time, including Mitt Romney, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mrs. Clinton, had all pounced on what they considered a greenhorn's campaign bluster. (Mr. Romney said Mr. Obama had become ''Dr. Strangelove.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In office, however, Mr. Obama has done exactly what he had promised, coming quickly to rely on the judgment of Mr. Brennan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brennan, a son of Irish immigrants, is a grizzled 25-year veteran of the C.I.A. whose work as a top agency official during the brutal interrogations of the Bush administration made him a target of fierce criticism from the left. He had been forced, under fire, to withdraw his name from consideration to lead the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama, becoming counterterrorism chief instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some critics of the drone strategy still vilify Mr. Brennan, suggesting that he is the C.I.A.'s agent in the White House, steering Mr. Obama to a targeted killing strategy. But in office, Mr. Brennan has surprised many former detractors by speaking forcefully for closing Guantanamo and respecting civil liberties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harold H. Koh, for instance, as dean of Yale Law School was a leading liberal critic of the Bush administration's counterterrorism policies. But since becoming the State Department's top lawyer, Mr. Koh said, he has found in Mr. Brennan a principled ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If John Brennan is the last guy in the room with the president, I'm comfortable, because Brennan is a person of genuine moral rectitude,'' Mr. Koh said. ''It's as though you had a priest with extremely strong moral values who was suddenly charged with leading a war.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president values Mr. Brennan's experience in assessing intelligence, from his own agency or others, and for the sobriety with which he approaches lethal operations, other aides say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The purpose of these actions is to mitigate threats to U.S. persons' lives,'' Mr. Brennan said in an interview. ''It is the option of last recourse. So the president, and I think all of us here, don't like the fact that people have to die. And so he wants to make sure that we go through a rigorous checklist: The infeasibility of capture, the certainty of the intelligence base, the imminence of the threat, all of these things.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the administration's very success at killing terrorism suspects has been shadowed by a suspicion: that Mr. Obama has avoided the complications of detention by deciding, in effect, to take no prisoners alive. While scores of suspects have been killed under Mr. Obama, only one has been taken into American custody, and the president has balked at adding new prisoners to Guantanamo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Their policy is to take out high-value targets, versus capturing high-value targets,'' said Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the top Republican on the intelligence committee. ''They are not going to advertise that, but that's what they are doing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's aides deny such a policy, arguing that capture is often impossible in the rugged tribal areas of Pakistan and Yemen and that many terrorist suspects are in foreign prisons because of American tips. Still, senior officials at the Justice Department and the Pentagon acknowledge that they worry about the public perception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have to be vigilant to avoid a no-quarter, or take-no-prisoners policy,'' said Mr. Johnson, the Pentagon's chief lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade-Offs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The care that Mr. Obama and his counterterrorism chief take in choosing targets, and their reliance on a precision weapon, the drone, reflect his pledge at the outset of his presidency to reject what he called the Bush administration's ''false choice between our safety and our ideals.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he has found that war is a messy business, and his actions show that pursuing an enemy unbound by rules has required moral, legal and practical trade-offs that his speeches did not envision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One early test involved Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban. The case was problematic on two fronts, according to interviews with both administration and Pakistani sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The C.I.A. worried that Mr. Mehsud, whose group then mainly targeted the Pakistan government, did not meet the Obama administration's criteria for targeted killing: he was not an imminent threat to the United States. But Pakistani officials wanted him dead, and the American drone program rested on their tacit approval. The issue was resolved after the president and his advisers found that he represented a threat, if not to the homeland, to American personnel in Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, in August 2009, the C.I.A. director, Leon E. Panetta, told Mr. Brennan that the agency had Mr. Mehsud in its sights. But taking out the Pakistani Taliban leader, Mr. Panetta warned, did not meet Mr. Obama's standard of ''near certainty'' of no innocents being killed. In fact, a strike would certainly result in such deaths: he was with his wife at his in-laws' home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Many times,'' General Jones said, in similar circumstances, ''at the 11th hour we waved off a mission simply because the target had people around them and we were able to loiter on station until they didn't.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not this time. Mr. Obama, through Mr. Brennan, told the C.I.A. to take the shot, and Mr. Mehsud was killed, along with his wife and, by some reports, other family members as well, said a senior intelligence official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attempted bombing of an airliner a few months later, on Dec. 25, stiffened the president's resolve, aides say. It was the culmination of a series of plots, including the killing of 13 people at Fort Hood, Tex. by an Army psychiatrist who had embraced radical Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is a good poker player, but he has a tell when he is angry. His questions become rapid-fire, said his attorney general, Mr. Holder. ''He'll inject the phrase, 'I just want to make sure you understand that.' '' And it was clear to everyone, Mr. Holder said, that he was simmering about how a 23-year-old bomber had penetrated billions of dollars worth of American security measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a few officials tentatively offered a defense, noting that the attack had failed because the terrorists were forced to rely on a novice bomber and an untested formula because of stepped-up airport security, Mr. Obama cut them short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Well, he could have gotten it right and we'd all be sitting here with an airplane that blew up and killed over a hundred people,'' he said, according to a participant. He asked them to use the close call to imagine in detail the consequences if the bomb had detonated. In characteristic fashion, he went around the room, asking each official to explain what had gone wrong and what needed to be done about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''After that, as president, it seemed like he felt in his gut the threat to the United States,'' said Michael E. Leiter, then director of the National Counterterrorism Center. ''Even John Brennan, someone who was already a hardened veteran of counterterrorism, tightened the straps on his rucksack after that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Axelrod, the president's closest political adviser, began showing up at the ''Terror Tuesday'' meetings, his unspeaking presence a visible reminder of what everyone understood: a successful attack would overwhelm the president's other aspirations and achievements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the most dramatic possible way, the Fort Hood shootings in November and the attempted Christmas Day bombing had shown the new danger from Yemen. Mr. Obama, who had rejected the Bush-era concept of a global war on terrorism and had promised to narrow the American focus to Al Qaeda's core, suddenly found himself directing strikes in another complicated Muslim country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The very first strike under his watch in Yemen, on Dec. 17, 2009, offered a stark example of the difficulties of operating in what General Jones described as an ''embryonic theater that we weren't really familiar with.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It killed not only its intended target, but also two neighboring families, and left behind a trail of cluster bombs that subsequently killed more innocents. It was hardly the kind of precise operation that Mr. Obama favored. Videos of children's bodies and angry tribesmen holding up American missile parts flooded You Tube, fueling a ferocious backlash that Yemeni officials said bolstered Al Qaeda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sloppy strike shook Mr. Obama and Mr. Brennan, officials said, and once again they tried to impose some discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pakistan, Mr. Obama had approved not only ''personality'' strikes aimed at named, high-value terrorists, but ''signature'' strikes that targeted training camps and suspicious compounds in areas controlled by militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some State Department officials have complained to the White House that the criteria used by the C.I.A. for identifying a terrorist ''signature'' were too lax. The joke was that when the C.I.A. sees ''three guys doing jumping jacks,'' the agency thinks it is a terrorist training camp, said one senior official. Men loading a truck with fertilizer could be bombmakers -- but they might also be farmers, skeptics argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, in the wake of the bad first strike in Yemen, Mr. Obama overruled military and intelligence commanders who were pushing to use signature strikes there as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are not going to war with Yemen,'' he admonished in one meeting, according to participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His guidance was formalized in a memo by General Jones, who called it a ''governor, if you will, on the throttle,'' intended to remind everyone that ''one should not assume that it's just O.K. to do these things because we spot a bad guy somewhere in the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama had drawn a line. But within two years, he stepped across it. Signature strikes in Pakistan were killing a large number of terrorist suspects, even when C.I.A. analysts were not certain beforehand of their presence. And in Yemen, roiled by the Arab Spring unrest, the Qaeda affiliate was seizing territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the Defense Department can target suspects in Yemen whose names they do not know. Officials say the criteria are tighter than those for signature strikes, requiring evidence of a threat to the United States, and they have even given them a new name -- TADS, for Terrorist Attack Disruption Strikes. But the details are a closely guarded secret -- part of a pattern for a president who came into office promising transparency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ultimate Test</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On that front, perhaps no case would test Mr. Obama's principles as starkly as that of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric and Qaeda propagandist hiding in Yemen, who had recently risen to prominence and had taunted the president by name in some of his online screeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president ''was very interested in obviously trying to understand how a guy like Awlaki developed,'' said General Jones. The cleric's fiery sermons had helped inspire a dozen plots, including the shootings at Fort Hood. Then he had gone ''operational,'' plotting with Mr. Abdulmutallab and coaching him to ignite his explosives only after the airliner was over the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That record, and Mr. Awlaki's calls for more attacks, presented Mr. Obama with an urgent question: Could he order the targeted killing of an American citizen, in a country with which the United States was not at war, in secret and without the benefit of a trial?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel prepared a lengthy memo justifying that extraordinary step, asserting that while the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process applied, it could be satisfied by internal deliberations in the executive branch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama gave his approval, and Mr. Awlaki was killed in September 2011, along with a fellow propagandist, Samir Khan, an American citizen who was not on the target list but was traveling with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the president had qualms about this momentous step, aides said he did not share them. Mr. Obama focused instead on the weight of the evidence showing that the cleric had joined the enemy and was plotting more terrorist attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is an easy one,'' Mr. Daley recalled him saying, though the president warned that in future cases, the evidence might well not be so clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of Mr. Awlaki's death, some administration officials, including the attorney general, argued that the Justice Department's legal memo should be made public. In 2009, after all, Mr. Obama had released Bush administration legal opinions on interrogation over the vociferous objections of six former C.I.A. directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, contemplating his own secrets, he chose to keep the Awlaki opinion secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Once it's your pop stand, you look at things a little differently,'' said Mr. Rizzo, the C.I.A.'s former general counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Hayden, the former C.I.A. director and now an adviser to Mr. Obama's Republican challenger, Mr. Romney, commended the president's aggressive counterterrorism record, which he said had a ''Nixon to China'' quality. But, he said, ''secrecy has its costs'' and Mr. Obama should open the strike strategy up to public scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This program rests on the personal legitimacy of the president, and that's not sustainable,'' Mr. Hayden said. ''I have lived the life of someone taking action on the basis of secret O.L.C. memos, and it ain't a good life. Democracies do not make war on the basis of legal memos locked in a D.O.J. safe.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tactics Over Strategy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his June 2009 speech in Cairo, aimed at resetting relations with the Muslim world, Mr. Obama had spoken eloquently of his childhood years in Indonesia, hearing the call to prayer ''at the break of dawn and the fall of dusk.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The United States is not -- and never will be -- at war with Islam,'' he declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the months that followed, some officials felt the urgency of counterterrorism strikes was crowding out consideration of a broader strategy against radicalization. Though Mrs. Clinton strongly supported the strikes, she complained to colleagues about the drones-only approach at Situation Room meetings, in which discussion would focus exclusively on the pros, cons and timing of particular strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At their weekly lunch, Mrs. Clinton told the president she thought there should be more attention paid to the root causes of radicalization, and Mr. Obama agreed. But it was September 2011 before he issued an executive order setting up a sophisticated, interagency war room at the State Department to counter the jihadi narrative on an hour-by-hour basis, posting messages and video online and providing talking points to embassies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama was heartened, aides say, by a letter discovered in the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan. It complained that the American president had undermined Al Qaeda's support by repeatedly declaring that the United States was at war not with Islam, but with the terrorist network. ''We must be doing a good job,'' Mr. Obama told his secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, Mr. Obama's record has not drawn anything like the sweeping criticism from allies that his predecessor faced. John B. Bellinger III, a top national security lawyer under the Bush administration, said that was because Mr. Obama's liberal reputation and ''softer packaging'' have protected him. ''After the global outrage over Guantanamo, it's remarkable that the rest of the world has looked the other way while the Obama administration has conducted hundreds of drone strikes in several different countries, including killing at least some civilians,'' said Mr. Bellinger, who supports the strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By withdrawing from Iraq and preparing to withdraw from Afghanistan, Mr. Obama has refocused the fight on Al Qaeda and hugely reduced the death toll both of American soldiers and Muslim civilians. But in moments of reflection, Mr. Obama may have reason to wonder about unfinished business and unintended consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His focus on strikes has made it impossible to forge, for now, the new relationship with the Muslim world that he had envisioned. Both Pakistan and Yemen are arguably less stable and more hostile to the United States than when Mr. Obama became president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justly or not, drones have become a provocative symbol of American power, running roughshod over national sovereignty and killing innocents. With China and Russia watching, the United States has set an international precedent for sending drones over borders to kill enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Blair, the former director of national intelligence, said the strike campaign was dangerously seductive. ''It is the politically advantageous thing to do -- low cost, no U.S. casualties, gives the appearance of toughness,'' he said. ''It plays well domestically, and it is unpopular only in other countries. Any damage it does to the national interest only shows up over the long term.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Blair's dissent puts him in a small minority of security experts. Mr. Obama's record has eroded the political perception that Democrats are weak on national security. No one would have imagined four years ago that his counterterrorism policies would come under far more fierce attack from the American Civil Liberties Union than from Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides say that Mr. Obama's choices, though, are not surprising. The president's reliance on strikes, said Mr. Leiter, the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center, ''is far from a lurid fascination with covert action and special forces. It's much more practical. He's the president. He faces a post-Abdulmutallab situation, where he's being told people might attack the United States tomorrow.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You can pass a lot of laws,'' Mr. Leiter said, ''Those laws are not going to get Bin Laden dead.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Presidential campaigns rarely run in a predictable, straight line, and this week will be no exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama and Mitt Romney will no doubt continue their sparring over Mr. Romney's experience at Bain Capital -- a debate that both campaigns seem eager to continue in speeches and television commercials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there will be other issues and distractions as well, including the following: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOBS Both campaigns are eagerly awaiting the release of new job numbers on Friday, an event that is certain to fuel the already intense discussion over the pace of job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, a disappointing report showing that only 115,000 jobs had been created in April gave a boost to Mr. Romney's criticism that the president's economic policies have not worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has responded with a concerted attack on Mr. Romney's history at Bain Capital, challenging his credentials as a job creator. ''There may be value in that kind of experience, but it's not in the White House,'' Mr. Obama said last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another anemic report could provide Mr. Romney with more ammunition. It might also prompt a new round of anti-Bain advertisements as the Obama campaign tries to change the subject by undermining Mr. Romney's record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REPUBLICANS For a while this year, it looked as if the Republican primary in Texas might have been the climax to the contentious intraparty feud. Now it is mostly an afterthought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the primary on Tuesday could give Mr. Romney the 1,144 delegates he needs to officially become the Republican Party's nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Rick Santorum dropped out of the race, he had looked to Texas as a place where he could make a significant dent in Mr. Romney's delegate total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum never made it that far. With all of Mr. Romney's rivals out of the hunt, there has been no campaigning in Texas. The Houston Chronicle estimates that Mr. Romney needs to win 70 percent of the vote on Tuesday to collect enough delegates to put him over the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he does not, he will probably have to wait until June 5 -- when California and four other states vote -- to clinch the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BIPARTISANSHIP True moments of bipartisanship are rare in Washington at any time. And they are almost impossible to find during the final six months of a presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there will be two hug-it-out moments this week at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mr. Obama will present the Presidential Medal of Freedom during a ceremony in the East Room to recipients including the author Toni Morrison and Pat Summitt, who recently stepped down as the women's basketball coach at the University of Tennessee. The presentation of the award -- the highest civilian honor -- is an event typically devoid of the partisan rancor so common in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on Thursday, Mr. Obama will welcome his predecessor, George W. Bush, and his wife, Laura, to the White House for the unveiling of their official portraits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time a presidential portrait was unveiled, Mr. Bush was on the other side of the equation: attending the unveiling of Bill Clinton's portrait during a ceremony at the White House on June 14, 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That day, Mr. Bush welcomed Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and sang their praises, putting aside their very deep political differences even as the presidential campaign of that year raged on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush said Mr. Clinton possessed a ''deep and far-ranging knowledge of foreign policy'' and a ''great compassion for people in need.'' He added: ''Bill Clinton could always see a better day ahead. He filled this house with energy and joy. He's a man of enthusiasm and warmth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expect similar accolades of Mr. Bush by Mr. Obama on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAMPAIGNING The nice words for Mr. Bush will not linger for long. On Friday, Mr. Obama will head to Minnesota for an economics event at which he will urge Congressional action on his ''to do'' list of legislation. And then he will attend several campaign events where criticizing Mr. Bush's economic legacy will again be front and center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign speeches are increasingly laced with derision for the economic policies of Mr. Bush and warnings that the country should not repeat them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look for those warnings again at campaign stops in Minnesota and Chicago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Rick Santorum dropped out of the race, he had looked to the state as a place where he could make a significant dent in Mr. Romney's delegate total. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum never made it that far. With all of Mr. Romney's rivals out of the hunt, there has been no campaigning in Texas. The Houston Chronicle estimates that Mr. Romney needs to win 70 percent of the vote on Tuesday to collect enough delegates to put him over the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he doesn't, he will probably have to wait until June 5 - when California and four other states vote - to clinch the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BIPARTISANSHIP  True moments of bipartisanship are rare in Washington at any time. And they are almost impossible to find during the final six months of a presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there will be two hug-it-out moments this week at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mr. Obama will present the Presidential Medal of Freedom during a ceremony in the East Room to recipients including the author Toni Morrison and Pat Summitt, who recently stepped down as the women's basketball coach at the University of Tennessee. The presentation of the award - the highest civilian honor - is an event typically devoid of the partisan rancor so common in the capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on Thursday, Mr. Obama will welcome his predecessor, George W. Bush, and his wife, Laura, to the White House for the unveiling of their official portraits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time a presidential portrait was unveiled, Mr. Bush was on the other side of the equation: attending the unveiling of Bill Clinton's portrait during a ceremony at the White House on June 14, 2004. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That day, Mr. Bush welcomed Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and sang their praises, putting aside their very deep political differences even as the presidential campaign of that year raged on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush said Mr. Clinton possessed a &quot;deep and far-ranging knowledge of foreign policy,&quot; a &quot;great compassion for people in need&quot; and said that &quot;Bill Clinton could always see a better day ahead. He filled this house with energy and joy. He's a man of enthusiasm and warmth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expect similar accolades of Mr. Bush by Mr. Obama on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAMPAIGNING The nice words for Mr. Bush will not linger for long. On Friday, Mr. Obama will head to Minnesota for an economics event at which he will urge Congressional action on his &quot;to do&quot; list of legislation. And then he will attend several campaign events where bashing Mr. Bush's economic legacy will once again be front and center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign speeches are increasingly laced with derision for the economic policies of Mr. Bush and warnings that the country should not repeat them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look for those warnings again at the campaign stops in Minnesota and Chicago.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the binary world of politics, President Obama's new ad attacking Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital is one of two things: a spot-on depiction of how the greedy enrich themselves by ruining people's lives, or a shameless indictment of free enterprise that confirms Obama's socialist leanings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reality, the ad  is neither. It is a fairly typical political attack that portrays an opponent in a harsh light by focusing on one unflattering episode in his past -- in this case Bain's handling of a steel mill in Kansas City, Mo. It follows in the tradition of trying to turn an opponent's perceived strength -- for Romney, his reputation as a job-creating Mr. Fix-it for the economy -- into a negative. Romney's opponents in the Republican primaries tried this approach, and now it's Team Obama's turn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forgive us for being unimpressed with the  furor over the ad. It would be far better to have an honest debate about the many benefits that private equity firms such as  Bain get from government, and whether those benefits are justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At their best, private equity firms perform a valuable service. They make the companies they buy more efficient, sometimes just by bringing in better management, but often by making tough but necessary job cuts. Bain -- which Romney founded in 1984 and ran for 15 years -- can point to a number of successes, including Domino's Pizza and mattress-maker Sealy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at their worst, private equity firms buy companies with borrowed funds, suck money out and leave them for dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the case with GST Steel, the company featured in the Obama&nbsp;ad, which Bain bought in 1993 with just $8 million of its own capital and mountains of debt. Under Bain's eight-year stewardship, more debt was added and Bain paid itself a $36.1 million dividend. In 2001 the company went bust, bringing to an end the 750 jobs that were left after years of shrinkage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are enough positive examples at Bain and other firms to reject the caricature of private equity managers as vultures and vampires.  But there are enough examples like  GST to re-examine the gifts they get from government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most obvious is the special tax treatment for &quot;carried interest,&quot; a loophole that allows managers of private equity firms, hedge funds and certain other entities to pay an income tax rate of just 15%, while managers at other types of companies pay up to 35%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is an indefensibly sweet deal, one that encourages top financiers to go into private equity, and gives their firms a leg up in the business of restructuring inefficient companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Combine the carried-interest treatment with a forgiving corporate bankruptcy code and the deduction for interest payments on corporate debt, and it's hard to avoid the conclusion that government wants to promote highly leveraged deals  such as the one that brought GST down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the issues we would like to see examined in a vigorous debate. Does it really make sense for government to be so friendly to private equity? And would more evenhanded policies limit the worst practices without ending the best ones?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That conversation would be more productive than histrionics over whether Obama is a socialist or whether Romney is a plutocrat. Alas, the presidential campaign season doesn't lend itself to that kind of mature discussion. <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After nearly two weeks of heated debate over whether President Obama should attack Republican Mitt Romney's tenure at a private-equity firm, Democratic leaders across the country say they are largely united behind the strategy, even as some concede an uncertain outcome and new polls show that Obama has lost ground nationally.          The Democratic leaders, in numerous interviews over the past week, said they are hearing little or no resistance among the party faithful in their states to a strategy that Republicans have characterized as anti-capitalist. And Obama has no plans to back off; his campaign will roll out more stories in the coming weeks that advisers said will again show Bain Capital as a corporate menace that protects profits at the expense of people and jobs.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wanted to have this conversation,&quot; Jim Burn, chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, said of Romney, the likely GOP nominee. &quot;We're going to have it. There should be no hesitation or equivocation.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nevada, one Democrat said voters direct most of the blame for the state's persistently high unemployment and foreclosure rates at Wall Street, describing it as the &quot;boogeyman&quot; of the election. In Ohio, party leaders said a large blue-collar population is receptive to evidence that Romney focused more on profits than on people. Even in New Hampshire, where unemployment, at 5 percent, is far lower than in the hardest-hit states, Raymond Buckley, the state Democratic chairman, said voters blame the &quot;reckless behavior&quot; of investors such as Romney for the declining fortunes of their family members and friends elsewhere. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look at Nevada,&quot; said Roberta Lange, the Democratic Party chairwoman there. &quot;Obama is speaking to the things that are important to us. The foreclosure market. Jobs. Romney has been absent from Nevada.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in other battleground states - including Virginia and Colorado - officials in both parties said there may be a risk of alienating business-minded independents, even if to many Democrats the risks are worth it. Republicans in particular welcomed the debate over Bain. Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) said Obama may intend for the Bain argument to &quot;galvanize his base.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think overall those policies aren't resonating particularly well with independents,&quot; McDonnell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Democrats in Virginia expressed concern that voters in the business-oriented suburbs around Washington would not coalesce around attacks on Bain. Sen. Mark R. Warner, a former cellphone entrepreneur, said in an interview that Bain is &quot;a valid issue and debate&quot; but also a company that &quot;did a good job for their investors.&quot; One prominent Virginia Democrat who requested anonymity to speak candidly said the Bain strategy is &quot;risky&quot; because it feeds an existing narrative among business leaders that the Obama administration is not friendly to their interests.          Such divergent observations suggest a geographic and economic divide over how Bain might play with voters.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat and a  restaurateur, said he made a point of telling Obama stories during his recent visit about the local entrepreneurial spirit. Hickenlooper said he was pleased that Obama also wove some of those entrepreneurial stories into his public remarks that day. He is among those who support the president's message about Bain but concede that they do not know whether it will work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does it really outsource a lot of jobs?&quot; Hickenlooper said. &quot;Does it downsize companies? That's a message that, if it takes hold, is something that voters are going to respond to.&quot; But, Hickenlooper added, &quot;it's too early to tell which arguments are persuading people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several new national polls show the Obama-Romney race tightening, despite several weeks of aggressive efforts by the president to frame the election around his foreign policy accomplishments, his economic policies and Romney's record at Bain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats said they always expected Romney to enjoy a small lift in the polls after his emergence from a bruising primary battle. They also pointed to polls in crucial battlegrounds, including Virginia and Ohio, where Obama's fortunes have improved. Still, the tightening is a reminder, they said, that this race is going to be won and lost on how Americans feel about the economy. That makes the Bain argument essential even if it carries certain risks, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama launched his Bain push two weeks ago, when his reelection campaign began an effort to portray in a negative light the private-equity company that Romney co-founded. The purpose, one Democratic strategist said, was to &quot;kick the legs out of&quot; Romney's image as an &quot;economic wizard.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A two-minute ad that aired last week focused on a shuttered steel mill in Kansas City, Mo., and the workers who lost their jobs after it went bankrupt under the supervision of Bain. One former worker in the ad called Bain a &quot;vampire&quot; that &quot;came in and sucked the life out of us.&quot;          Like those in Virginia, Republicans in New Hampshire and Colorado said they believed the Bain attacks would not work among independent voters. In Colorado, where biotechnology and energy investments have driven economic growth for the past few decades, voters may see Obama's message as an attack against the investments that have helped start-up ventures get off the ground.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said he attended a roundtable session last week with about 30 bioscience companies, some with 10 employees and others with thousands, and said many there told him they viewed the Obama campaign's attacks as a &quot;shame campaign&quot; against the private-equity and venture-capital sectors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think people in Colorado understand that this is attacking a very positive opportunity for Colorado, which is trying to find investment opportunities to help their small businesses,&quot; said Gardner, who was elected in a swing district in 2010. &quot;This is a very entrepreneurial state. The president's campaign is at odds with the entrepreneurial spirit of Colorado.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), also elected in 2010, said she hears the same thing from voters in her state.           &quot;It's punishing success, which to me doesn't really resonate with people in New Hampshire,&quot; she said. &quot;Basically what you're doing is trying to demagogue a whole industry that tries to rescue failed companies. For many of those failed companies it's the last resort of ability to get financing and keep the company afloat before they try to declare bankruptcy.&quot;           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayotte said the Bain issue may be moot in her state because voters there are already familiar with Romney and his background, considering he served four years as governor of neighboring Massachusetts and spent considerable time campaigning in New Hampshire during the primary season. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a very strong sense of him,&quot; Ayotte said. &quot;I think that that's not going to resonate here. I don't hear a lot about that when I'm out doing my town hall meetings as a primary issue in the election. I think it's going to be a real question of looking at the president's record and who's going to perform better on the economy and the debt.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lange, the Democratic Party chief in Nevada, said the local experience makes the Bain argument extremely powerful, thanks to a single, familiar company that Bain invested in - the Stage department store chain, which filed for bankruptcy in 2000 and experienced significant job losses. The Obama campaign has made an issue of Stage, although it entered bankruptcy after Bain sold it and later recovered from its earlier setbacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Lange, the department store illustrates an inherent advantage of the president's Bain strategy, which can be offered in specific regions with examples likely to resonate with local voters. The Obama campaign has taken that approach in Nevada, Ohio and Iowa, all important swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney and other Republicans have offered up alternative examples of companies that prospered under Bain's leadership and have denied that Romney was involved in some of the examples Obama has cited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans also jumped at the chance to portray Obama as someone who does not get business. They defended Romney's Bain years, distributing examples of when the company helped turn around businesses or get them off the ground. And they sharply attacked the president, saying he lacks an understanding of how the economy works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he did not know whether the Obama campaign's attacks against Romney will work to vilify the Republican challenger. &quot;This is their effort to turn Romney into Gordon Gekko, and I think they feel that that's their best shot at making him unelectable,&quot; McConnell said.           That approach made a few Democrats uncomfortable, including Newark Mayor Cory Booker and former Pennsylvania governor Edward G. Rendell, who said in widely circulated interviews that they were displeased with the tone of the attacks.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men later said that they, too, think Bain is fair game. (Rendell said he got a &quot;thank you&quot; from Obama's campaign in Chicago.) And based on more than a dozen interviews with Democrats in key battlegrounds, there is little evidence that their initial discomfort reflects a widespread view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Obama's focus on Bain has not wavered, and it is not likely to, campaign advisers said.&quot;This is not a distraction,&quot; the president told reporters last week, tamping down Booker's remarks from an earlier television interview. &quot;This is what the campaign is going to be about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many Democrats across the country, that was what they wanted to hear. &quot;This is the conversation we need to have,&quot; said Burn, the Pennsylvania party chairman.  &quot;I would be more concerned if the campaign decided the tack needed to change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After nearly two weeks of heated debate over whether President Obama should attack Republican Mitt Romney's tenure at a private-equity firm, Democratic leaders across the country say they are largely united behind the strategy, even as some concede an uncertain outcome and new polls show that Obama has lost ground nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic leaders, in numerous interviews over the past week, said they are hearing little or no resistance among the party faithful in their states to a strategy that Republicans have characterized as anti-capitalist. And Obama has no plans to back off; his campaign will roll out more stories in the coming weeks that advisers said will again show Bain Capital as a corporate menace that protects profits at the expense of people and jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wanted to have this conversation,&quot; Jim Burn, chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, said of Romney, the likely GOP nominee. &quot;We're going to have it. There should be no hesitation or equivocation.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nevada, one Democrat said voters direct most of the blame for the state's persistently high unemployment and foreclosure rates at Wall Street, describing it as the &quot;boogeyman&quot; of the election. In Ohio, party leaders said a large blue-collar population is receptive to evidence that Romney focused more on profits than on people. Even in New Hampshire, where unemployment, at 5 percent, is far lower than in the hardest-hit states, Raymond Buckley, the state Democratic chairman, said voters blame the &quot;reckless behavior&quot; of investors such as Romney for the declining fortunes of their family members and friends elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look at Nevada,&quot; said Roberta Lange, the Democratic Party chairwoman there. &quot;Obama is speaking to the things that are important to us. The foreclosure market. Jobs. Romney has been absent from Nevada.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in other battleground states - including Virginia and Colorado - officials in both parties said there may be a risk of alienating business-minded independents, even if to many Democrats the risks are worth it. Republicans in particular welcomed the debate over Bain. Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) said Obama may intend for the Bain argument to &quot;galvanize his base.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I think overall those policies aren't resonating particularly well with independents,&quot; McDonnell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Democrats in Virginia expressed concern that voters in the business-oriented suburbs around Washington would not coalesce around attacks on Bain. Sen. Mark R. Warner, a former cellphone entrepreneur, said in an interview that Bain is &quot;a valid issue and debate&quot; but also a company that &quot;did a good job for their investors.&quot; One prominent Virginia Democrat who requested anonymity to speak candidly said the Bain strategy is &quot;risky&quot; because it feeds an existing narrative among business leaders that the Obama administration is not friendly to their interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such divergent observations suggest a geographic and economic divide over how Bain might play with voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat and a  restaurateur, said he made a point of telling Obama stories during his recent visit about the local entrepreneurial spirit. Hickenlooper said he was pleased that Obama also wove some of those entrepreneurial stories into his public remarks that day. He is among those who support the president's message about Bain but concede that they do not know whether it will work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does it really outsource a lot of jobs?&quot; Hickenlooper said. &quot;Does it downsize companies? That's a message that, if it takes hold, is something that voters are going to respond to.&quot; But, Hickenlooper added, &quot;it's too early to tell which arguments are persuading people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several new national polls show the Obama-Romney race tightening, despite several weeks of aggressive efforts by the president to frame the election around his foreign policy accomplishments, his economic policies and Romney's record at Bain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats said they always expected Romney to enjoy a small lift in the polls after his emergence from a bruising primary battle. They also pointed to polls in crucial battlegrounds, including Virginia and Ohio, where Obama's fortunes have improved. Still, the tightening is a reminder, they said, that this race is going to be won and lost on how Americans feel about the economy. That makes the Bain argument essential even if it carries certain risks, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama launched his Bain push two weeks ago, when his reelection campaign began an effort to portray in a negative light the private-equity company that Romney co-founded. The purpose, one Democratic strategist said, was to &quot;kick the legs out of&quot; Romney's image as an &quot;economic wizard.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A two-minute ad that aired last week focused on a shuttered steel mill in Kansas City, Mo., and the workers who lost their jobs after it went bankrupt under the supervision of Bain. One former worker in the ad called Bain a &quot;vampire&quot; that &quot;came in and sucked the life out of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like those in Virginia, Republicans in New Hampshire and Colorado said they believed the Bain attacks would not work among independent voters. In Colorado, where biotechnology and energy investments have driven economic growth for the past few decades, voters may see Obama's message as an attack against the investments that have helped start-up ventures get off the ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said he attended a roundtable session last week with about 30 bioscience companies, some with 10 employees and others with thousands, and said many there told him they viewed the Obama campaign's attacks as a &quot;shame campaign&quot; against the private-equity and venture-capital sectors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think people in Colorado understand that this is attacking a very positive opportunity for Colorado, which is trying to find investment opportunities to help their small businesses,&quot; said Gardner, who was elected in a swing district in 2010. &quot;This is a very entrepreneurial state. The president's campaign is at odds with the entrepreneurial spirit of Colorado.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), also elected in 2010, said she hears the same thing from voters in her state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's punishing success, which to me doesn't really resonate with people in New Hampshire,&quot; she said. &quot;Basically what you're doing is trying to demagogue a whole industry that tries to rescue failed companies. For many of those failed companies it's the last resort of ability to get financing and keep the company afloat before they try to declare bankruptcy.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayotte said the Bain issue may be moot in her state because voters there are already familiar with Romney and his background, considering he served four years as governor of neighboring Massachusetts and spent considerable time campaigning in New Hampshire during the primary season. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a very strong sense of him,&quot; Ayotte said. &quot;I think that that's not going to resonate here. I don't hear a lot about that when I'm out doing my town hall meetings as a primary issue in the election. I think it's going to be a real question of looking at the president's record and who's going to perform better on the economy and the debt.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lange, the Democratic Party chief in Nevada, said the local experience makes the Bain argument extremely powerful, thanks to a single, familiar company that Bain invested in - the Stage department store chain, which filed for bankruptcy in 2000 and experienced significant job losses. The Obama campaign has made an issue of Stage, although it entered bankruptcy after Bain sold it and later recovered from its earlier setbacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Lange, the department store illustrates an inherent advantage of the president's Bain strategy, which can be offered in specific regions with examples likely to resonate with local voters. The Obama campaign has taken that approach in Nevada, Ohio and Iowa, all important swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney and other Republicans have offered up alternative examples of companies that prospered under Bain's leadership and have denied that Romney was involved in some of the examples Obama has cited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans also jumped at the chance to portray Obama as someone who does not get business. They defended Romney's Bain years, distributing examples of when the company helped turn around businesses or get them off the ground. And they sharply attacked the president, saying he lacks an understanding of how the economy works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he did not know whether the Obama campaign's attacks against Romney will work to vilify the Republican challenger. &quot;This is their effort to turn Romney into Gordon Gekko, and I think they feel that that's their best shot at making him unelectable,&quot; McConnell said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That approach made a few Democrats uncomfortable, including Newark Mayor Cory Booker and former Pennsylvania governor Edward G. Rendell, who said in widely circulated interviews that they were displeased with the tone of the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men later said that they, too, think Bain is fair game. (Rendell said he got a &quot;thank you&quot; from Obama's campaign in Chicago.) And based on more than a dozen interviews with Democrats in key battlegrounds, there is little evidence that their initial discomfort reflects a widespread view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Obama's focus on Bain has not wavered, and it is not likely to, campaign advisers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a distraction,&quot; the president told reporters last week, tamping down Booker's remarks from an earlier television interview. &quot;This is what the campaign is going to be about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many Democrats across the country, that was what they wanted to hear. &quot;This is the conversation we need to have,&quot; said Burn, the Pennsylvania party chairman.  &quot;I would be more concerned if the campaign decided the tack needed to change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the brand-name French theorists of the mid-20th century, Roland Barthes was the fun one. (Foucault was the tough one, Derrida was the dreamy one, Lacan was the mysterious one -- I like to imagine them sometimes as a black-turtlenecked, clove-smoking boy band called Hors de Texte, with the hit album ''Discipline 'n' Punish.'') Instead of constructing multivolume monuments of systematic thought, Barthes wrote short books built out of fragments. He was less interested in traditional coherence than in what he called jouissance: joy, surprise, adventure, pleasure -- tantric orgasms of critical insight rolling from fragment to fragment. He proclaimed the death of the author and advocated a style of reading he referred to as ''writerly,'' in which readers work as active creators of a text. His critical metabolism ran unusually high: he would flit from subject to subject, defining new fields of interest (semiology, narratology) only to abandon them and leave others to do the busywork.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He treated canonical French works with such unorthodox flair it drove conservative professors crazy. (Barthes first rose to prominence, or notoriety, thanks to the furor surrounding his early book about Racine.) In his inaugural lecture at the College de France -- a sort of mission statement for the most prestigious academic post in the country -- Barthes announced that he aspired above all to ''forget'' and to ''unlearn'' and proposed, as a kind of motto, ''no power, a little knowledge, a little wisdom and as much flavor as possible.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most reliable and user-friendly source of Barthes's special variety of fun -- the bouillon cube, if you will, of his critical flavor -- is his early book ''Mythologies,'' originally published in 1957. In it, Barthes basically invented what we think of as cultural criticism: he was the first really first-rate intellectual to tell us what our most mundane pop culture actually means. For decades, however, only part of ''Mythologies'' was available in English. Its recent rerelease in a new and (for the first time) complete translation gives us an excuse not only to reread the book but also to consider some of the larger questions it raises, nearly 60 years later, for those of us still swimming through pop culture, and in particular for those of us who consider ourselves critics of that culture, which, these days, seems to be just about everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mythologies'' is, characteristically, less a unified whole than a collection of parts: 53 short essays that Barthes wrote for a literary journal under the rubric ''Mythology of the Month.'' The column was Barthes's way of dealing with the explosion of mass culture in the decade after World War II -- the rise to omnipresence of a hypercommodified cluster of media (magazines, film, radio, television) that was shaping everyone's lives on the deepest possible level, like a new form of psychological gravity. In his modest (and non-Newtonian) way, Barthes set out to be mass culture's Newton: to identify the laws of its behavior, test its stresses, reveal the invisible boundaries of its influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barthes's basic idea (although with Barthes it's always dangerous to reduce things to a basic idea) was that the operation of mass culture is analogous to mythology. He argued that the cultural work previously done by gods and epic sagas -- teaching citizens the values of their society, providing a common language -- was now being done by film stars and laundry-detergent commercials. In ''Mythologies,'' his project was to demystify these myths. He wrote essays about professional wrestling, celebrity weddings, soap advertisements, actors' publicity photos, trends in children's toys and an initiative by the president of France to get citizens to drink more milk. He wrote an essay about Greta Garbo's face. (''The face of Garbo is an Idea, that of Hepburn, an Event.'') He wrote an essay about Billy Graham, who had come to preach in Paris. (''If God is really speaking through Dr. Graham's mouth, it must be acknowledged that God is quite stupid.'') He wrote about plastic. (''It is the first magical substance which consents to be prosaic.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barthes wasn't the only one writing in the 1950s about this kind of cultural trivia. John Updike's tenure as a staff writer for The New Yorker, for instance, where he wrote mock-anthropologically about pigeons and pedestrians' faces, coincided almost exactly with Barthes's ''Mythology'' columns. But Barthes's tone was unique: a detached theoretical rigor that came out in aphorisms, the best of which made it seem as if you were understanding familiar things (the luxuriousness of foam, the significance of a monk's haircut) for the very first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of Barthes's insights apply just as powerfully to contemporary culture as they did to postwar France. Here he is, for instance, analyzing the species of campaign photo -- still popular today -- in which politicians stare off into the distance: ''The gaze is lost nobly in the future, it does not confront, it soars and fertilizes some other domain, which is chastely left undefined. Almost all three-quarter-face photos are ascensional, the face is lifted toward a supernatural light, which draws it up and elevates it to the realm of a higher humanity; the candidate reaches the Olympus of elevated feelings, where all political contradictions are solved.'' I find this impossible to read without thinking of Obama, Romney, Palin, Sarkozy, Che Guevara and, of course, Stephen Colbert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most basic lesson of ''Mythologies'' is that everything means something, especially things that try to seem beyond meaning. ''In a single day,'' Barthes writes toward the end of the book, ''how many really nonsignifying fields do we cross? Very few, sometimes none. Here I am, before the sea; it is true that it bears no message. But on the beach, what material for semiology! Flags, slogans, signals, signboards, clothes, suntan even, which are so many messages to me.'' (He was the Walt Whitman of critical theory.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If 21st-century culture has embraced any of Barthes's lessons, it is this one. What is the blogosphere if not a Petri dish of amateur semiology -- the decoding of everything?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This also suggests, however, one of the major differences between postmillennial America and 1950s France. Barthes was writing at the dawn of what we think of as mass culture: a time when the average citizen's relationship to images was changing rapidly, when the texts people shared were suddenly not just religious or civic or local but global: a common set of images drawn from commercial entertainment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dawn of that kind of culture has obviously long since passed. We now live at least in its late afternoon, possibly even its twilight. The Internet, notoriously, came along and broke the old model's kneecaps. Instead of just passively absorbing a series of broadcasts from Planet Media, consumers today participate directly in the creation of culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To my mind, the thing that's exploding into relevance in our era is not mass culture but the critique of mass culture -- the Barthesian dissection of everything, no matter how trivial. This happens everywhere now, often in real time. And this critical analysis is often as vital and interesting and consumable as the culture it discusses. Consider, for instance, the way the TV recap has evolved into a nearly independent creative form. So the critical analysis of pop culture has itself become a kind of pop culture. We seem to be approaching some kind of singularity -- a collapse of creativity and criticism into one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A culture critic is, by definition, betwixt and between: not a regular consumer of culture and yet someone immersed deeply enough in it to appreciate its inner mechanisms. Barthes wrote about mass culture, most often, as a radical outsider. This is a major source of the power of ''Mythologies.'' He was a marginal figure in the French intellectual scene, writing in a literary journal not for consumers of mass culture but for other intellectuals. In fact, one of the most striking aspects of ''Mythologies'' is Barthes's contempt for the petite bourgeoisie, the target audience of the culture he's dissecting. (The ''essential enemy,'' he writes, is ''the bourgeois norm.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mythologies'' is often an angry book, and what angered Barthes more than anything was ''common sense,'' which he identified as the philosophy of the bourgeoisie, a mode of thought that systematically pretends that complex things are simple, that puzzling things are obvious, that local things are universal -- in short, that cultural fantasies shaped by all the dirty contingencies of power and money and history are in fact just the natural order of the universe. The critic's job, in Barthes's view, was not to revel in these common-sensical myths but to expose them as fraudulent. The critic had to side with history, not with culture. And history, Barthes insisted, ''is not a good bourgeois.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to imagine many critics today plausibly positioning themselves outside pop culture to the extent that Barthes did. Mass culture has grown and evolved; it has become more fully ''naturalized'' and therefore further resistant to critique, even as cultural criticism flourishes. And our criticism comes much more often from deep inside the culture, with the dominant attitude being acceptance, if not outright affection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This raises the question of what this intermingling does to the authority of our criticism -- whether it deepens or weakens our force, makes us more qualified to interpret or just reduces us to bit players in the great capitalist theater of mass culture. I keep imagining the questions Barthes might have asked about criticism today. Isn't even a negative review that falls within the promotional cycle of a film or TV series essentially an endorsement of that thing as a valid product -- a tacit advertisement for it? Does writing for a magazine or a Web site dominated by ads make the critic an extension of those ads -- in essence, an advertisement for the ads?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a book devoted almost entirely to 60-year-old pop culture, ''Mythologies'' feels surprisingly relevant today. Yet the parts that strike me as most dated -- and least Barthesian -- are the eruptions of blistering Marxist scorn, when Barthes dismisses the petite bourgeoisie and its culture as ''infantile.'' (This, I freely admit, could be because of my compromised position as a 21st-century bourgeois.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My favorite moments in the book are those in which Barthes seems moved by, and invested in, the culture he discusses: when he writes, for instance, about professional wrestling as a spectacle of justice, and seems to be defending it against reflexive and shallow criticism. In Barthes's posthumously published book ''Mourning Diary'' -- a collection of the notes he made after the death of his mother in 1977, 20 years after ''Mythologies'' -- there is an especially poignant moment. Barthes admits to breaking down in tears when he hears a song by Gerard Souzay, a singer he once dismissed in ''Mythologies'' as the epitome of melodramatic bourgeois art. In this moment of contradiction, he seems very modern, and fully Barthesian.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The past several days of Newark Mayor Cory Booker's life have been painfully amusing to watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Painful because Booker, a rising Democratic star, is such a good guy. Amusing, because rarely are Americans treated to such premier seats in the political theater of truth and consequence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is, tell the truth and beware the consequences. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker has gained much unwelcome attention from his own political party, while being nearly sanctified by Republicans, for the singular offense of telling the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then untelling the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then . . . stay tuned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To know Booker is to like him. He's one of those political figures whose persona telegraphs &quot;honest broker.&quot; Educated at Stanford, Oxford and Yale Law School, he's also a popular mayor in one of America's toughest, most challenged cities. Open-minded and solution-oriented, he's what we hope for in public officials. Or say we do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But honesty is not always a rewarding trait in politics, especially during high-stakes election years, as Booker promptly learned when he recently spoke from the heart on &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; He said that attacks on Bain Capital, where Mitt Romney made a fortune, were &quot;nauseating&quot; to him, as were similar attacks from the right to resurrect the Rev. Jeremiah Wright controversy.           &quot;I have to just say from a very personal level, I'm not about to sit here and indict private equity,&quot; Booker said. &quot;To me, it's just this - we're getting to a ridiculous point in America, especially that I know. I live in a state where pension funds, unions and other people are investing in companies like Bain Capital. If you look at the totality of Bain Capital's record, it ain't - they've done a lot to support businesses, to grow businesses.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hearts leapt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While regular folks shielded their eyes from the blinding light of Truth, political operatives left and right shifted into warp speed. Republicans produced an insta-ad capitalizing on Booker's remarks - See? Even Democrats dislike President Obama's attack on Bain - while their counterparts on the left began launching correctives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama adviser David Axelrod promptly made the rounds and explained to talk show hosts what Booker really meant. (As though Americans can't understand what they plainly hear.) Others pointed out Booker's own cozy relationship with equity capital political donors. And Booker, obviously scrambling to recapture favor with the Obama campaign, posted a YouTube video before another sun had set. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What he &quot;really&quot; meant: &quot;Let me be clear. Mitt Romney has made his business record a centerpiece of his campaign,&quot; Booker says in the video. &quot;He's talked about himself as a job creator. And therefore it is reasonable - and in fact I encourage it - for the Obama campaign to examine that record and to discuss it. I have no problem with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentators have all cast their ballots as to whether Booker should have corrected himself. Almost unanimously, the answer was no. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously, if you're a surrogate for the president, as Booker described himself on &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; your job is to regurgitate talking points. No wandering around the reservation, no independent thinking, certainly no personal confessions. You absolutely do not declare the centerpiece of the president's attack on his opponent to be &quot;nauseating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless it is. And unless it's true. For you, you know, when you're alone with your conscience. Or having lunch with your private-equity donors, as the case may be. But definitely not while on TV! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             On Rachel Maddow's show, Booker dug a little deeper: &quot;Obviously, I did things in the 'Meet the Press' interview, as I told you, that did not land the points that I was trying to make. And in some ways, you know, frustratingly, I think I conflated the attacks that the Republicans were making with Jeremiah Wright with some of the attacks on the left. And those can't even be equated.&quot;          Worse, from the party's perspective, Booker described himself as an &quot;independent Democrat.&quot; Oops.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We may like independents in theory, but surrogates don't get to be independent. You gotta pick one or the other. This has been the immediate lesson for Cory Booker. But the broader lesson for the public is that there's no space in our body politic for an independent mind, even though more Americans describe themselves as independent than either Democrat or Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thinking outside the box may solve problems in the real world. But in the political realm, creative noodling will get you cast into the outer darkness. No matter which way you lean, The Machinery requires cogs, not cognizance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To secure his standing as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney has disowned every sliver of moderation in his record. He's moved to the right on tax cuts and twisted himself into a pretzel over the health-care plan he championed  in Massachusetts - because conservatives are no longer allowed to acknowledge that government can improve citizens' lives.          Romney is simply following the lead of Republicans in Congress who have abandoned American conservatism's most attractive features: prudence, caution and a sense that change should be gradual. But most important, conservatism used to care passionately about fostering community, and it no longer does. This commitment now lies buried beneath slogans that lift up the heroic and disconnected individual - or the &quot;job creator&quot; - with little concern for the rest.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's conservatism is about low taxes, fewer regulations, less government - and little else. Anyone who dares to define it differently faces political extinction. Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana was considered a solid conservative, until conservatives decided that anyone who seeks bipartisan consensus on anything is a sellout. Even Orrin Hatch of Utah, one of the longest-serving Republican senators, is facing a primary challenge. His flaw? He occasionally collaborated with the late Democratic senator Edward M. Kennedy on providing health insurance coverage for children and encouraging young Americans to join national service programs . In the eyes of Hatch's onetime allies, these commitments make him an ultra-leftist.          I have long admired the conservative tradition and for years have written about it with great respect. But the new conservatism, for all its claims of representing the values that inspired our founders,  breaks with the country's deepest traditions. The United States rose to power and wealth on the basis of a balance between the public and the private spheres, between government and the marketplace, and between our love of individualism and our quest for community.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatism today places individualism on a pedestal, but it originally arose in revolt against that idea. As the conservative thinker Robert A. Nisbet noted in 1968, conservatism represented a &quot;reaction to the individualistic Enlightenment.&quot; It &quot;stressed the small social groups of society&quot; and regarded such clusters of humanity - not individuals - as society's &quot;irreducible unit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, conservatives continue to preach the importance of the family as a communal unit. But for Nisbet and many other conservatives of his era, the movement was about something larger. It &quot;insisted upon the primacy of society to the individual - historically, logically and ethically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the depth of our commitment to individual liberty, Americans never fully adopted this all-encompassing view of community. But we never fully rejected it, either. And therein lies the genius of the American tradition: We were born with a divided political heart. From the beginning, we have been torn by a deep but healthy tension between individualism and community. We are communitarian individualists or individualistic communitarians, but we have rarely been comfortable with being all one or all the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The great American conservative William F. Buckley Jr. certainly understood this. In his book &quot;Gratitude: Reflections on What We Owe to Our Country,&quot; he quotes approvingly John Stuart Mill's insistence that &quot;everyone who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit.&quot; With liberty comes responsibility to the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the Civil War, conservatives such as Alexander Hamilton and Henry Clay believed in an active federal government that served the common good. This included a commitment to internal improvements (what we now, less elegantly, call infrastructure), public schooling, and the encouragement of manufacturing and science. Clay, an unapologetic supporter of national economic planning, called his program &quot;the American System,&quot; explicitly distinguishing his idea from the British laissez-faire system. (The Club for Growth would not have been pleased.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abraham Lincoln, for whom Clay was a hero, built upon this tradition, laying the foundation for our public universities by backing the establishment of land-grant colleges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil War pensions - the first great social insurance program and a central Republican cause - were supporting about 28 percent of men 65 and over by 1910. In 1894, the program's most expensive year, the pensions accounted for 37 percent of federal spending. Sounds like a massive entitlement program, doesn't it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the first American version of socialized medicine was signed into law in 1798 by that great conservative president John Adams. The Marine Hospital Service funded hospitals across the country to treat sailors who were sick or got injured on the job. There is no record of a mass campaign to repeal AdamsCare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Conservative himself, Robert A. Taft, a Republican senator from Ohio and Senate majority leader, urged federal support for decent housing for all Americans in the 1940s. Dwight Eisenhower created the interstate highway system and established the federal student loan program in the 1950s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, Ronald Reagan never tried to dismantle the New Deal and acknowledged, sometimes with wry humor, the need for tax increases. He was acutely alive to the communal side of conservatism. Nearly all of the pictures in his 1984 &quot;Morning in America&quot; commercial - one of the most famous political ads in our history - invoked community: a father and son working together, tidy neighborhoods, a wedding, young campers earnestly saluting the flag. Reagan spoke regularly not only of the power of the market and the dangers of Soviet communism, but also of the centrality of families and neighborhoods.          George W. Bush, who promoted &quot;compassionate conservatism,&quot; built on old progressive programs with his No Child Left Behind law, using federal aid to education as a lever for reform. And he added a prescription-drug benefit to the Medicare program that Lyndon B. Johnson pushed into law.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, until recently conservatives operated within America's long consensus that accepted a market economy as well as a robust role for a government that served the common good. American politics is now roiled because this consensus is under the fiercest attack it has faced in more than 100 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most of the 20th century, conservatives and progressives alternated in power, each trying to correct the mistakes of the other. Neither scared the wits out of the other (although campaign rhetoric sometimes suggested otherwise), and this equilibrium allowed both sides to compromise and move forward. It didn't mean that politics was devoid of philosophical conflicts, of course. The clashes over McCarthyism, the civil rights revolution, the Vietnam War, Watergate and the Great Inflation of the late 1970s remind us that our consensus went only so far. Conservatives challenged aspects of the New Deal-era worldview from the late 1960s on, dethroning a liberal triumphalism that long refused to take conservatism seriously. Over time, even progressives came to appreciate some essential instincts that conservatives brought to the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why has this consensus unraveled?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modern conservatism's rejection of its communal roots is a relatively recent development. It can be traced to a simultaneous reaction against Bush's failures and Barack Obama's rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush's unpopularity at the end of his term encouraged conservatives, including the fledgling tea party movement, to distance themselves from his legacy. They declared that Bush's shortcomings stemmed from his embrace of &quot;big government&quot; and &quot;big spending&quot; - even if much of the spending was in Iraq and Afghanistan. They recoiled from his &quot;compassionate conservatism,&quot; deciding, as right-wing columnist Michelle Malkin put it, that &quot; 'compassionate conservatism' and fiscal conservatism were never compatible.&quot; That would be true, of course, only if &quot;fiscal conservatism&quot; were confined to reductions in government and not viewed instead as an effort to keep revenue and spending in line with each other, which was how older conservatives had defined the term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, in the meantime, pitched communal themes from the moment he took office, declaring in his inaugural address that America is &quot;bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions .&quot; The more he emphasized a better balance between the individual and the community, the less interested conservatives became in anything that smacked of such equilibrium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          That's why today's conservatives can't do business with liberals or even moderates who are still working within the American tradition defined by balance. It's why they can't agree even to budget deals that tilt heavily, but not entirely, toward spending cuts; only sharp reductions in taxes and government will do. It's why they cannot accept (as Romney and the Heritage Foundation once did) energetic efforts by the government to expand access to health insurance. It's why, even after a catastrophic financial crisis, they continue to resist new rules aimed not at overturning capitalism but at making it more stable.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For much of our history, Americans - even in our most quarrelsome moments - have avoided the kind of polarized politics we have now. We did so because we understood that it is when we balance our individualism with a sense of communal obligation that we are most ourselves as Americans. The 20th century was built on this balance, and we will once again prove the prophets of U.S. decline wrong if we can refresh and build upon that tradition. But doing so will require conservatives to abandon untempered individualism, which betrays what conservatism has been and should be.             ejdionne@washpost.com          </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney is simply following the lead of Republicans in Congress who have abandoned American conservatism's most attractive features: prudence, caution and a sense that change should be gradual. But most important, conservatism used to care passionately about fostering community, and it no longer does. This commitment now lies buried beneath slogans that lift up the heroic and disconnected individual - or the &quot;job creator&quot; - with little concern for the rest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's conservatism is about low taxes, fewer regulations, less government - and little else. Anyone who dares to define it differently faces political extinction. Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana was considered a solid conservative, until conservatives decided that anyone who seeks bipartisan consensus on anything is a sellout. Even Orrin Hatch of Utah, one of the longest-serving Republican senators, is facing a primary challenge. His flaw? He occasionally collaborated with the late Democratic senator Edward M. Kennedy on providing health insurance coverage for children and encouraging young Americans to join national service programs. In the eyes of Hatch's onetime allies, these commitments make him an ultra-leftist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have long admired the conservative tradition and for years have written about it with great respect. But the new conservatism, for all its claims of representing the values that inspired our founders,  breaks with the country's deepest traditions. The United States rose to power and wealth on the basis of a balance between the public and the private spheres, between government and the marketplace, and between our love of individualism and our quest for community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatism today places individualism on a pedestal, but it originally arose in revolt against that idea. As the conservative thinker Robert A. Nisbet noted in 1968, conservatism represented a &quot;reaction to the individualistic Enlightenment.&quot; It &quot;stressed the small social groups of society&quot; and regarded such clusters of humanity - not individuals - as society's &quot;irreducible unit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, conservatives continue to preach the importance of the family as a communal unit. But for Nisbet and many other conservatives of his era, the movement was about something larger. It &quot;insisted upon the primacy of society to the individual - historically, logically and ethically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the depth of our commitment to individual liberty, Americans never fully adopted this all-encompassing view of community. But we never fully rejected it, either. And therein lies the genius of the American tradition: We were born with a divided political heart. From the beginning, we have been torn by a deep but healthy tension between individualism and community. We are communitarian individualists or individualistic communitarians, but we have rarely been comfortable with being all one or all the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The great American conservative William F. Buckley Jr. certainly understood this. In his book &quot;Gratitude: Reflections on What We Owe to Our Country,&quot; he quotes approvingly John Stuart Mill's insistence that &quot;everyone who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit.&quot; With liberty comes responsibility to the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the Civil War, conservatives such as Alexander Hamilton and Henry Clay believed in an active federal government that served the common good. This included a commitment to internal improvements (what we now, less elegantly, call infrastructure), public schooling, and the encouragement of manufacturing and science. Clay, an unapologetic supporter of national economic planning, called his program &quot;the American System,&quot; explicitly distinguishing his idea from the British laissez-faire system. (The Club for Growth would not have been pleased.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abraham Lincoln, for whom Clay was a hero, built upon this tradition, laying the foundation for our public universities by backing the establishment of land-grant colleges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil War pensions - the first great social insurance program and a central Republican cause - were supporting about 28 percent of men 65 and over by 1910. In 1894, the program's most expensive year, the pensions accounted for 37 percent of federal spending. Sounds like a massive entitlement program, doesn't it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the first American version of socialized medicine was signed into law in 1798 by that great conservative president John Adams. The Marine Hospital Service funded hospitals across the country to treat sailors who were sick or got injured on the job. There is no record of a mass campaign to repeal AdamsCare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Conservative himself, Robert A. Taft, a Republican senator from Ohio and Senate majority leader, urged federal support for decent housing for all Americans in the 1940s. Dwight Eisenhower created the interstate highway system and established the federal student loan program in the 1950s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, Ronald Reagan never tried to dismantle the New Deal and acknowledged, sometimes with wry humor, the need for tax increases. He was acutely alive to the communal side of conservatism. Nearly all of the pictures in his 1984 &quot;Morning in America&quot; commercial - one of the most famous political ads in our history - invoked community: a father and son working together, tidy neighborhoods, a wedding, young campers earnestly saluting the flag. Reagan spoke regularly not only of the power of the market and the dangers of Soviet communism, but also of the centrality of families and neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George W. Bush, who promoted &quot;compassionate conservatism,&quot; built on old progressive programs with his No Child Left Behind law, using federal aid to education as a lever for reform. And he added a prescription-drug benefit to the Medicare program that Lyndon B. Johnson pushed into law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, until recently conservatives operated within America's long consensus that accepted a market economy as well as a robust role for a government that served the common good. American politics is now roiled because this consensus is under the fiercest attack it has faced in more than 100 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most of the 20th century, conservatives and progressives alternated in power, each trying to correct the mistakes of the other. Neither scared the wits out of the other (although campaign rhetoric sometimes suggested otherwise), and this equilibrium allowed both sides to compromise and move forward. It didn't mean that politics was devoid of philosophical conflicts, of course. The clashes over McCarthyism, the civil rights revolution, the Vietnam War, Watergate and the Great Inflation of the late 1970s remind us that our consensus went only so far. Conservatives challenged aspects of the New Deal-era worldview from the late 1960s on, dethroning a liberal triumphalism that long refused to take conservatism seriously. Over time, even progressives came to appreciate some essential instincts that conservatives brought to the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why has this consensus unraveled?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modern conservatism's rejection of its communal roots is a relatively recent development. It can be traced to a simultaneous reaction against Bush's failures and Barack Obama's rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush's unpopularity at the end of his term encouraged conservatives, including the fledgling tea party movement, to distance themselves from his legacy. They declared that Bush's shortcomings stemmed from his embrace of &quot;big government&quot; and &quot;big spending&quot; - even if much of the spending was in Iraq and Afghanistan. They recoiled from his &quot;compassionate conservatism,&quot; deciding, as right-wing columnist Michelle Malkin put it, that &quot; 'compassionate conservatism' and fiscal conservatism were never compatible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would be true, of course, only if &quot;fiscal conservatism&quot; were confined to reductions in government and not viewed instead as an effort to keep revenue and spending in line with each other, which was how older conservatives had defined the term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, in the meantime, pitched communal themes from the moment he took office, declaring in his inaugural address that America is &quot;bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions.&quot; The more he emphasized a better balance between the individual and the community, the less interested conservatives became in anything that smacked of such equilibrium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why today's conservatives can't do business with liberals or even moderates who are still working within the American tradition defined by balance. It's why they can't agree even to budget deals that tilt heavily, but not entirely, toward spending cuts; only sharp reductions in taxes and government will do. It's why they cannot accept (as Romney and the Heritage Foundation once did) energetic efforts by the government to expand access to health insurance. It's why, even after a catastrophic financial crisis, they continue to resist new rules aimed not at overturning capitalism but at making it more stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For much of our history, Americans - even in our most quarrelsome moments - have avoided the kind of polarized politics we have now. We did so because we understood that it is when we balance our individualism with a sense of communal obligation that we are most ourselves as Americans. The 20th century was built on this balance, and we will once again prove the prophets of U.S. decline wrong if we can refresh and build upon that tradition. But doing so will require conservatives to abandon untempered individualism, which betrays what conservatism has been and should be.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney's campaign claims to be outraged that President Obama would dare criticize its candidate's experience of running Bain Capital, a private-equity firm. Some Democratic politicians have also said the president went too far in tarring an important driver of economic growth. The financial price has been high: Mr. Romney's campaign is reaping unusually generous Wall Street contributions, while Mr. Obama's campaign is raising far less from the financial sector than it did four years ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign, however, is right to make an issue of Mr. Romney's tenure at Bain. Mr. Romney argues that his experience in the private sector makes him the best choice to revive the economy, and voters need to understand the precise nature of that experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks ago, the Obama campaign released an ad showing a few of the 750 Kansas City steelworkers who were laid off after Bain Capital bought their company and later sent it into bankruptcy proceedings. ''We view Mitt Romney as a job destroyer,'' one of them said. The president explained later that Mr. Romney's principal goals in the private-equity field -- maximizing profits, making money for investors -- are not what the presidency is about. ''My job is to take into account everybody, not just some,'' he said. ''My job is to make sure that the country is growing not just now, but 10 years from now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Bain Capital, Mr. Romney made businesses more efficient, but often at a high human cost. (More than a fifth of Bain's acquisitions went bankrupt, while Bain usually made money.) His embrace of Republican budgets that would benefit the wealthy while hurting the poor and the middle class shows his priorities haven't changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private equity, rarely by design, has created many jobs. But the practice of leveraged buyouts, in which Bain was a big player, has also contributed significantly to the growth of the income gap, moving wealth from the middle class to the top end. The president is helping to remind voters of the direct line between Mr. Romney's previous priorities and the ones he intends to pursue in office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States quietly passed a milestone this spring, mostly lost amid the clamor of the presidential race: for the first time, neither party's candidate is a white Protestant. The contenders are both from outsider groups that were once persecuted, and despite Harvard degrees and notable successes, both men have felt the sting of being treated as somehow strange or different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigns have mostly been in a state of detente on identity politics, trying to avoid mutually assured destruction. But the outsider backgrounds of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have marked the race in subtler ways, shaping the candidates and campaigns, causing them to mirror each other in many ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides face the specter of longstanding prejudices that no ad, slogan or speech may be able to dispel. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey conducted last week, 27 percent of those polled said that having a Mormon president raised concerns for them or someone they know, and 12 percent said the same for a black president. Some voters say outright that they will not vote for Mr. Obama because he is black; others make jokes about Mr. Romney belonging to a cult. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They're both dealing with the unknown: how far has the country progressed?'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In public, both sides avow that the campaign is about substantive issues, and that religion and race will not determine who wins. In private, those close to Mr. Romney express concerns about faith that sound uncannily like those of their Democratic counterparts on race. Mr. Romney's friends and aides frequently ask whether some of the things said and written about him would be uttered about a candidate of another religion. (''Would you have written this about a Jewish candidate?'' his aides often ask reporters.) In interviews, some of his friends wished aloud for an organization like the Anti-Defamation League to patrol public discourse for anti-Mormon statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their comments echo those of some Obama aides, who are nagged by the suspicion that he would be treated differently if he were white. (''Would this have been said about Bill Clinton?'' is the question they often ask.) The subject came up again last week, when Representative Mike Coffman, Republican of Colorado, said that Mr. Obama was ''not an American,'' then apologized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also parallels between the two candidates themselves, like their elliptical language: In a speech at Liberty University this month, Mr. Romney talked about his faith without ever saying ''Mormon.'' Weighing in on the racially fraught Trayvon Martin case, the president never used the word ''black,'' instead saying, indirectly but with clear feeling, ''If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. Obama does not want to answer for past statements by his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. (including some that many voters find offensive), just as Mr. Romney does not want to be held accountable for every policy of his church (including some that many voters find offensive).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the president, the legacy of the blowup over Mr. Wright in 2008 has been a drawing inward and greater caution on matters relating to race. Mr. Obama, who once wrote a lyrical memoir about racial identity and taught a class called Race and the Law, learned on the campaign trail just how toxic anything related to his personal experience of race or religion could become. He declined to join a church in Washington; his aides feared triggering the same kind of fracas that engulfed his old one. Mr. Romney is just as reticent, sticking to brief statements that emphasize that Mormons are Christians who believe in Jesus Christ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their approaches are safe but also somewhat obscuring. Being the first black president is one of the richest, most singular veins of Mr. Obama's experience, but he almost never lets the country know what it is like. Mr. Romney has called being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints one of his chief influences, and yet he does not reveal whatever emotion, lessons or moral force he derives from faith. Neither man is a voluble, heart-on-sleeve politician to begin with, and refusing to discuss central aspects of their identities can make each seem yet more remote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After one successful campaign and three plus years in the White House, Mr. Obama and his team's painful early internal debates on how to handle race have given way to more settled patterns. But Mr. Romney's camp is divided on the question of how much he should speak about his personal faith. Some in his circles, including many Mormons, argue that his religion is nothing to hide and helps mitigate the caricature of him as a cruel capitalist. Mr. Romney's political advisers, few of whom are Mormon, are more cautious, arguing that religion should be off the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We as a society have decided to judge people on their actions and not based on where they go to church or the color of their skin,'' said Stuart Stevens, Mr. Romney's top strategist. ''It's true when you apply for a job, it's true when you apply for a driver's license and it should be true when you run for president.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reluctance of Mr. Romney and his team may be warranted. Many Mormons found his first run for president deeply troubling because they anticipated a new benchmark of acceptance in American society. Instead they encountered the kinds of hostile reactions they thought had mostly vanished, like a 2006 article on Slate.com in which Jacob Weisberg argued that Joseph Smith was a ''con man'' and the religion a ''transparent and recent fraud.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''A lot of our people were surprised and disappointed'' that that point of view was still acceptable, said Michael Otterson, a spokesman for the church, which does not endorse candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Richard Lyman Bushman, a leading historian of Mormonism who has known the candidate since they served together in the church decades ago, Mr. Romney's quest is the latest stage in a process that began over a century ago, when Mormons banned polygamy, opening the way to mainstream acceptance. Now, Professor Bushman said, the national judgment on the religion can be summarized by the musical ''Book of Mormon,'' which depicts church members as sweet, hardworking people with outlandish but harmless beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, a single question hung over the Obama campaign until election night: Would the country vote for a black man? Now Mr. Romney faces his own version.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If a Mormon is a doctor, or teaching your kids, or even the leader of the Senate, that's fine,'' Professor Bushman said. ''But president? The emblem of the country?''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a near-flawless docking on Friday, start-up rocket company SpaceX achieved what only big governments have to date: It launched a mission to the international space station.          The moment marked a pivot point in U.S. space ambitions, away from total NASA control and toward creative private enterprise. While NASA furnished seed money and technical advice, SpaceX engineers designed, built, launched and drove the white gumdrop-shaped Dragon capsule until the final moments.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the docking marked a milestone, it was more a policy win than a technical achievement: Shooting stuff into space has been routine for 50 years, and the Dragon carried no astronauts. That is a bigger mission that SpaceX and other U.S. companies are now racing toward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Launching cargo, difficult as it is, is much less difficult than launching humans,&quot; said NASA astronaut Clayton Anderson, who spent five months on the space station in 2007. &quot;SpaceX still has some challenges to get through.&quot;But the docking did help validate a space policy that's drawn scorn and hope. Former and current astronauts, legislators and policymakers have questioned whether the private sector can launch a vehicle with brute force and then delicately pirouette it around a football-field-size orbiting outpost. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SpaceX controllers did both this week and made it look easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a remarkable ride,&quot; Michael Suffredini, NASA's space station manager, said shortly after Dragon's docking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a two-hour delay to fix a balky laser range finder on Dragon, two station astronauts - American Don Pettit and Dutchman Andre Kuipers - lassoed the capsule with a giant robotic arm at 9:56 a.m.          &quot;Looks like we've got us a dragon by the tail,&quot; Pettit quipped from 250 miles above Australia.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheers erupted in two mission control rooms - at NASA in Houston and SpaceX headquarters near Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video feeds showed the casually dressed SpaceX team high-fiving and hugging. Elon Musk, the company's usually voluble founder, later said he had no words for the &quot;moment of elation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two hours later, the station astronauts snuggled Dragon into a docking port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mission nearly complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my 20 years with NASA, rarely did things go that smoothly,&quot; said Michael Lopez-Alegria, a former space station commander and president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, an industry group. &quot;And they never go that smoothly the very first time.&quot;          He added, &quot;I'm not sure I would've put money on it two weeks ago.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had reason to worry. Conceived in 2006 as a space shuttle replacement, NASA's commercial spaceflight program is three years behind schedule. The SpaceX mission was repeatedly delayed since last year, most recently Saturday, when the Falcon 9 rocket's engines fired and then squelched on the launchpad because of a bad valve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Tuesday, the rocket finally soared atop an arc of orange. It was the second SpaceX mission for the Dragon capsule. In December 2010, a Dragon orbited the Earth and splashed down off the California coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Musk sat in front of that first, scorched Dragon as SpaceX workers chanted his name, shouting, &quot;We love Elon!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For weeks, the Internet millionaire had been scaling back expectations, saying this was a test flight, a shake-down mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at a post-docking news briefing, Musk beamed and repeated his ambition to fly people to Mars and beyond. &quot;This was a crucial step,&quot; he said, toward spreading humanity to other planets. &quot;The chance of that just went up dramatically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While more circumspect, NASA and White House officials also heralded the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential science adviser John P. Holdren, in a statement, called the moment &quot;an achievement of historic scientific and technological significance&quot; and &quot;a key milepost in President Obama's vision for America's continued leadership in space.&quot;          NASA administrator Charles F. Bolden Jr., attending the International Space Development Conference in Washington, watched on a video screen and exclaimed, &quot;We have berthed!&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday's success edges SpaceX closer to sending astronauts back into orbit from American soil. After retiring its space shuttles last year, NASA now relies on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the station - at $63 million a seat. Last year, the agency funded four U.S. companies, including SpaceX, to build a space vehicle safe enough for humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But NASA and the Obama administration are battling Congress over funding. The administration wants $800 million for the commercial crew program next year, but the House of Representatives wants to cut that nearly in half. NASA's Bolden has vehemently pushed back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Musk said that SpaceX could be ready to fly people into space by 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Scott Pace, a space policy expert at George Washington University and an adviser to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said the company first needs a track record. &quot;They need to fly [cargo] six or seven times consecutively,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With nearly 2,000 employees, SpaceX is ramping up production to fulfill $4 billion in contracts, with NASA just one of their customers. The company is young - the average employee age is 30 - and Musk said he's picked a team that balances &quot;the wisdom of age with the vibrancy of youth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their next mission - the first of 12 deliveries to the station - is slated for September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a local company, Orbital Sciences of Dulles, is preparing a new launchpad on Wallops Island, Va., to send its new cargo carrier to the space station late this year.The two companies are slated to make the bulk of cargo runs in the future to the station, which is now supplied by Russia, Japan and the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with food, water and computers, the Dragon carried a tiny cargo that began its journey in the District: two vials with a waste-purifying experiment designed by eighth-graders at Stuart-Hobson Middle School. Station astronauts will snap the vials like glow sticks, mingling bacillus bacteria with egg white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kyra Smith, the 14-year-old D.C. Public Schools student who conceived the experiment, said, &quot;I'm interested in environmental conservation, so I thought astronauts that go up into the space station could reuse water and save space on their rockets.&quot; If her experiment works, the bacteria will clear out the egg white - which is standing in for human waste. The experiment is one of 15 on the Dragon chosen from among 800 schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program was started by the nonprofit National Center for Earth and Space Science Education in Capitol Heights to give students experience running experiments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Dragon is scheduled to depart the station, carrying Smith's vials along with frozen blood and urine from astronaut biology experiments and old spacesuit parts. If all goes well, it will splash down in the Pacific later that day.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a near-flawless docking on Friday, start-up rocket company SpaceX achieved what only big governments have to date: It launched a mission to the international space station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moment marked a pivot point in U.S. space ambitions, away from total NASA control and toward creative private enterprise. While NASA furnished seed money and technical advice, SpaceX engineers designed, built, launched and drove the white gumdrop-shaped Dragon capsule until the final moments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the docking marked a milestone, it was more a policy win than a technical achievement: Shooting stuff into space has been routine for 50 years, and the Dragon carried no astronauts. That is a bigger mission that SpaceX and other U.S. companies are now racing toward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Launching cargo, difficult as it is, is much less difficult than launching humans,&quot; said NASA astronaut Clayton Anderson, who spent five months on the space station in 2007. &quot;SpaceX still has some challenges to get through.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the docking did help validate a space policy that's drawn scorn and hope. Former and current astronauts, legislators and policymakers have questioned whether the private sector can launch a vehicle with brute force and then delicately pirouette it around a football-field-size orbiting outpost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SpaceX controllers did both this week and made it look easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a remarkable ride,&quot; Michael Suffredini, NASA's space station manager, said shortly after Dragon's docking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a two-hour delay to fix a balky laser range finder on Dragon, two station astronauts - American Don Pettit and Dutchman Andre Kuipers - lassoed the capsule with a giant robotic arm at 9:56 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looks like we've got us a dragon by the tail,&quot; Pettit quipped from 250 miles above Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheers erupted in two mission control rooms - at NASA in Houston and SpaceX headquarters near Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video feeds showed the casually dressed SpaceX team high-fiving and hugging. Elon Musk, the company's usually voluble founder, later said he had no words for the &quot;moment of elation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two hours later, the station astronauts snuggled Dragon into a docking port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mission nearly complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my 20 years with NASA, rarely did things go that smoothly,&quot; said Michael Lopez-Alegria, a former space station commander and president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, an industry group. &quot;And they never go that smoothly the very first time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney's campaign sees the time he spent at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he co-founded and ran for more than a decade, as a positive experience that highlights his leadership skills and his ability to turn around companies and create jobs. President Obama's campaign, meanwhile, views Mr. Romney's Bain Capital years as a political liability that underscores his image as an out-of-touch multimillionaire, concerned only with turning profits for his wealthy investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Romney's campaign, the scrutiny of his time at Bain poses a delicate challenge: not only must he defend himself against attacks coming from the president, but he also must try to cast Bain and the lessons he learned there as a testament to his management skills. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gearing up to confront the attacks, the Romney campaign is actively recruiting testimonials from workers who have had positive experiences with Bain. It is getting ready to release advertising highlighting Bain's marquee success stories, like the turnaround of Staples. It is considering seeking out middle-class surrogates -- a fireman or members of a teachers union, for instance -- who would be willing to talk about how Bain managed and increased the size of their pension funds, a lesser-known aspect of private equity. And, repeating a strategy that worked well for the campaign in the nominating contests, it is hoping Mr. Obama's attacks backfire, painting him as an enemy of free enterprise and capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When things are just factually inaccurate, we'll point those out, but we'll continue to point out that Bain was successful because it helped grow companies, and that meant more people having work,'' said Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Romney campaign plans to argue that Mr. Romney created jobs during his time at Bain, the proposition is a tricky one; the driving force of private equity is to create profits for investors, and while job creation may be a happy byproduct of corporate turnarounds, it is never the stated goal, and jobs cuts are very often a consequence, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's advisers are betting that if they stay out of the nuances of private equity and tell a story about turning around failing companies, they can transform the Bain attacks into a narrative that underscores Mr. Romney's image as a skilled executive who can steer a troubled economy back to prosperity. A senior aide said that the campaign's internal polling showed that the more voters learned about Bain -- or the pro-Romney version of Bain, at least -- the more likely they were to favor Mr. Romney over the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think he'll continue to describe it in very understandable terms, about creating jobs, which they did, about turning things around, which they did, and about believing in the American dream and the American worker and American innovation,'' said Kent Lucken, a Romney adviser. ''Mitt Romney is someone who can bring those practices into government, in terms of making America more competitive. American competitiveness, in terms of competing with China, sits very well with the Bain narrative.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's private equity years have been a challenge to him since the moment he jumped into the political fray in a bid to unseat Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts in 1994. For that campaign, Mr. Kennedy unleashed ads featuring disgruntled workers at American Pad &amp; Paper, a company that cut factory jobs and slashed wages under Bain's ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's team knew heading into this race that Bain would probably crop up again as an issue, and the campaign has done its own exhaustive research into his Bain years to portray them in the best possible light. When the Obama campaign unveiled its first private equity attack ad last week, featuring GST Steel, a company that filed for bankruptcy under Bain's watch (but after Mr. Romney had left the company), the Romney campaign was ready with a video spot of its own, highlighting grateful workers at Steel Dynamics, a company in Indiana that Bain helped grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for all its preparation and forewarning, the Romney campaign -- famous for its message discipline and single-strategy approach toward problems -- has yet to settle on a clear, overarching way to handle the Bain criticism that is certain to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One campaign adviser said that aides were somewhat split over how to respond to the president's attacks. Some believe that the campaign should reply by simply highlighting the benefits of private equity and mock Democrats who attack the industry. Others are pushing for a more aggressive approach that forcefully embraces Mr. Romney's 15 years at Bain, with advertising that features successes like Staples and the Sports Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney team also plans to attack Mr. Obama over Solyndra, the solar-panel company that filed for bankruptcy after receiving millions in taxpayer loans. And they say that the Bain attacks from Mr. Obama simply help them paint Mr. Obama as anti-business and pivot the debate toward the economy, more comfortable ground for Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We're happy to compare Governor Romney's record of success both at the Statehouse in Massachusetts and as a businessman for 25 years in the private sector to the lack of real world economy experience of President Obama,'' said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior Romney adviser, in a conference call with reporters Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign has also gotten help from some unlikely quarters: namely, the Democrats. When asked how Mr. Romney was going to respond to attacks on Bain, Matt Rhoades, the campaign manager, pointed to a list of Democrats including the Newark mayor, Cory Booker, and a former Pennsylvania governor, Ed Rendell, who have seemed to criticize Mr. Obama's initial attacks. ''We like how they are responding,'' Mr. Rhoades said in an e-mail message.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of a devastating financial crisis, President Obama has enacted some modest and obviously needed regulation; he has proposed closing a few outrageous tax loopholes; and he has suggested that Mitt Romney's history of buying and selling companies, often firing workers and gutting their pensions along the way, doesn't make him the right man to run America's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wall Street has responded -- predictably, I suppose -- by whining and throwing temper tantrums. And it has, in a way, been funny to see how childish and thin-skinned the Masters of the Universe turn out to be. Remember when Stephen Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group compared a proposal to limit his tax breaks to Hitler's invasion of Poland? Remember when Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase characterized any discussion of income inequality as an attack on the very notion of success? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But here's the thing: If Wall Streeters are spoiled brats, they are spoiled brats with immense power and wealth at their disposal. And what they're trying to do with that power and wealth right now is buy themselves not just policies that serve their interests, but immunity from criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, before I get to that, let me take a moment to debunk a fairy tale that we've been hearing a lot from Wall Street and its reliable defenders -- a tale in which the incredible damage runaway finance inflicted on the U.S. economy gets flushed down the memory hole, and financiers instead become the heroes who saved America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once upon a time, this fairy tale tells us, America was a land of lazy managers and slacker workers. Productivity languished, and American industry was fading away in the face of foreign competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then square-jawed, tough-minded buyout kings like Mitt Romney and the fictional Gordon Gekko came to the rescue, imposing financial and work discipline. Sure, some people didn't like it, and, sure, they made a lot of money for themselves along the way. But the result was a great economic revival, whose benefits trickled down to everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can see why Wall Street likes this story. But none of it -- except the bit about the Gekkos and the Romneys making lots of money -- is true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the alleged productivity surge never actually happened. In fact, overall business productivity in America grew faster in the postwar generation, an era in which banks were tightly regulated and private equity barely existed, than it has since our political system decided that greed was good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about international competition? We now think of America as a nation doomed to perpetual trade deficits, but it was not always thus. From the 1950s through the 1970s, we generally had more or less balanced trade, exporting about as much as we imported. The big trade deficits only started in the Reagan years, that is, during the era of runaway finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what about that trickle-down? It never took place. There have been significant productivity gains these past three decades, although not on the scale that Wall Street's self-serving legend would have you believe. However, only a small part of those gains got passed on to American workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, no, financial wheeling and dealing did not do wonders for the American economy, and there are real questions about why, exactly, the wheeler-dealers have made so much money while generating such dubious results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are, however, questions that the wheeler-dealers don't want asked -- and not, I think, just because they want to defend their tax breaks and other privileges. It's also an ego thing. Vast wealth isn't enough; they want deference, too, and they're doing their best to buy it. It has been amazing to read about erstwhile Democrats on Wall Street going all in for Mitt Romney, not because they believe that he has good policy ideas, but because they're taking President Obama's very mild criticism of financial excesses as a personal insult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it has been especially sad to see some Democratic politicians with ties to Wall Street, like Newark's mayor, Cory Booker, dutifully rise to the defense of their friends' surprisingly fragile egos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I said at the beginning, in a way Wall Street's self-centered, self-absorbed behavior has been kind of funny. But while this behavior may be funny, it is also deeply immoral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think about where we are right now, in the fifth year of a slump brought on by irresponsible bankers. The bankers themselves have been bailed out, but the rest of the nation continues to suffer terribly, with long-term unemployment still at levels not seen since the Great Depression, with a whole cohort of young Americans graduating into an abysmal job market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in the midst of this national nightmare, all too many members of the economic elite seem mainly concerned with the way the president apparently hurt their feelings. That isn't funny. It's shameful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The president's advisers think his actions in office and the changing face of the military could overcome a traditional Republican advantage. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the height of the Iraq war in 2004, veterans gave President George W. Bush a 16-percentage-point edge over his Democratic rival. Four years later, Barack Obama trailed among the former military members by 10 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama's campaign said it thinks his three and a half years as commander in chief have turned the tables on the issue, giving him a good chance at winning the veteran vote this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Mr. Obama's first campaign ads - released just this week  - was aimed directly at war-weary service members and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's because of what they've done that we've been able to go after al-Qaeda and kill Bin Laden,&quot; Mr. Obama says in the ad. &quot;And when they come home we have a sacred trust to make sure that we are doing everything we can to heal all of their wounds, giving them the opportunities that they deserve to find a job and get the education that they need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is part of Mr. Obama's efforts to capitalize on a very different profile than is typical for a Democratic president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having come into the White House on an antiwar platform, Mr. Obama nonetheless increased American involvement in Afghanistan even as he began drawing down troops in Iraq. Now, both wars are winding down - a<BR>relief to many military members and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Mr. Obama has embraced the use of drones to assassinate terrorist leaders. And he authorized the raid that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama is committed to ensuring that all of our men and women who've served in uniform can find work when they return home, receive the health care and benefits they've earned and have the chance to get a college education through the post-9/11 G.I. Bill,&quot; said Clo Ewing, a campaign spokeswoman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working in Mr. Obama's favor may be the changing face of the American military, which is becoming younger and more diverse. Advisers to the president note that he actually won in 2008 among veterans who were under 60 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military is also changing in its attitudes toward social issues, the Obama campaign believes. Mr. Obama's decision to end the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; ban on gays serving openly will be a benefit, they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little recent polling to suggest how the two candidates are faring among veterans. But advisers to Mr. Romney scoff at the idea that Mr. Obama will steal away a traditional Republican advantage come Election Day. They argue that the president's economic policies have been especially detrimental to veterans and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president's policies have not provided opportunity for the next generation of soldiers who are returning home from the battlefield,&quot; said Ryan Williams, a spokesman for Mr. Romney. &quot;We think that's an important distinction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Williams said unemployment among veterans of the Iraq war stands at 9.2 percent, higher than the 8.1 percent rate for the nation as a whole. And, he said, nearly one in five veterans of that war was unemployed in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama's policies have failed veterans and they are looking to elect a different president,&quot; Mr. Williams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns lay claim to having the better ideas for helping veterans once they come home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign points to the  Post-9/11 G.I. Bill that the president signed into law as evidence of how his policies have already helped veterans. Mr. Romney's campaign says Mr. Obama's budget cuts veterans benefits deeply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the effort to woo military members and their families also depends on the candidates' broader approach to military issues and waging war - and on how to pay for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign is using the president's support of the debt-ceiling deal last year that would force huge cuts in defense spending if Congress can't find a way to avoid them. Mr. Romney has opposed the defense cuts, calling them a danger to the quality of the armed forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Williams, the spokesman for Mr. Romney, called them &quot;devastating and crippling defense cuts&quot; that would &quot;leave our armed forces in a state of disarray. These irresponsible defense cuts do not appeal to veterans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign aides to the president counter that Mr. Romney's proposals would leave veterans without the proper care and respect the deserve. Ms. Ewing said Mr. Romney &quot;suggested privatizing veterans' health care, eliminating the department that helps homeless veterans and fails to mention veterans once in his 160-page, 59-point plan for jobs and economic growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's advisers are also betting that the public at large - and veterans in particular - will not view the president as weak on defense, in part because of the actions he's taken as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad his campaign released this week features grainy, green-tinted video of military operations on the screen as Mr. Obama praises the soldiers who went on the raid that killed Bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also frequently mentions the Bin Laden raid in speeches and on the campaign trail. During a commencement speech to members of the Air Force Academy this week, Mr. Obama said that &quot;for the first time<BR>in your lives -- and thanks to Air Force personnel who did their part -- Osama bin Laden is no longer a threat to our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advisers in Chicago, where Mr. Obama's campaign has its headquarters, are also counting on support from veterans who are happy that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are coming to an end. Many soldiers and Marines served multiple tours of duty in those countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, though, it remains an open question whether Mr. Obama's actions as president - and a changing military - can help him overcome the traditional advantage that Republicans have held among veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer to that question may not come until Election Day.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an election year in which the economy ranks as Americans' top concern, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney holds significant advantages over President Obama among white voters who are struggling financially and buffeted by job loss, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked which candidate would do more to advance their families' economic interests, middle-class white voters who say they are struggling to maintain their financial positions chose Romney over Obama by a large margin - 58 percent to 32 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Massachusetts governor has a similar advantage on this question among white voters who have lost a job in recent years, or who have seen a family member or close friend face unemployment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonwhite voters, struggling or not, give Obama huge leads over Romney when it comes to looking after their families' financial interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results underscore a continuing challenge for Obama and the Democratic Party with white voters, and particularly those without college degrees - who, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, are significantly more likely to be unemployed than those with higher education.           Indeed, among whites who described themselves as struggling to maintain their economic footing - regardless of their current class - nearly seven in 10 lacked a college diploma. And although they lean more Republican than the population in general, it is a group that neither party can ignore. In the new poll, 31 percent of these voters described themselves as Republicans, 27 percent as Democrats.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Obama lost whites without college degrees by a big margin, 58 percent to 40 percent, according to the national exit poll. That performance among such voters was similar to John F. Kerry's in 2004 and Al Gore's in 2000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats are very likely to lose those voters&quot; again this year, said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. &quot;The question is by how much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One factor that may help the president is that, in the 14 or fewer swing states likely to determine the outcome of the election, unemployment rates have dropped more sharply than they have for the nation as a whole. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the extended economic hardship many Americans are facing - across racial and partisan lines - makes those who are vulnerable a particularly important target group for both campaigns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's reelection team is attempting to portray Romney as out of touch with and unsympathetic to the anxieties of middle-class Americans. A much-talked-about Obama campaign advertisement airing in Ohio depicts Bain Capital, a private-equity firm that Romney founded, as a &quot;vampire&quot; that sucked the last financial lifeblood of failing companies at the expense of their workers.All of the people featured in the ad criticizing Bain appear to be white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spot, however, has brought criticism from within the president's party, including from Edward G. Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and Democratic Party chairman. They have expressed concern that the tone of the attack will make the party appear to be opposed to the private-equity industry, which is an important player in the national economy and a major source of campaign contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, meanwhile, portrays the president as out of his depth on economic issues. And in the Republican's current advertising campaign, he highlights steps he would take as president to roll back policies that the Obama administration has put into place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the poll, Americans overall reported widespread economic pain, with more than seven in 10 saying they have been affected directly or indirectly by unemployment in the past few years. Four in 10 report struggling to maintain their socioeconomic status, with about one in five saying they are in the middle class and straining to stay there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty percent of all voters say Obama would do more to advance the interests of the middle class more generally, and 44 percent say so of Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On that question, Obama has an advantage of 53 percent to 41 percent among those who think their foothold in the middle class is relatively secure, while the two candidates divide about equally among those struggling to stay there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That overall parity, as has been the case in the past, disguises a vast racial divide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among white voters trying to stay in the middle class, Romney is considered the better candidate for that group by a 20-point margin; Obama is preferred by better than 3 to 1 among middle-class nonwhite voters, regardless of their sense of security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whites and nonwhites - as well as voters across party lines - agree that Romney would do more than Obama to advocate for the economic interests of wealthy Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By a 23-point margin, voters say it's Romney, not Obama, who would do more to advance the interests of Wall Street. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the new federal regulations for banks and other financial institutions put in place during the current administration, few voters - about one in four - say they have struck the right balance. About 25 percent of all voters say the regulations &quot;go too far,&quot; while 39 percent say &quot;not far enough.&quot; Most Democrats say the new rules are not sufficiently tough; among Republicans, twice as many say they are unnecessarily restrictive compared with those saying they are too lenient. Independents tilt in the &quot;not far enough&quot; direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The telephone poll was conducted May 17 to 20 among a random national sample of 1,004 adults. The margin of sampling error for the full poll is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The margin is four points for the sample of 874 registered voters.          </SPAN></P>

About 25 percent of all voters say the regulations &quot;go too far,&quot; while 39 percent say &quot;not far enough.&quot; Most Democrats say the new rules are not sufficiently tough; among Republicans, twice as many say they are unnecessarily restrictive compared with those saying they are too lenient. Independents tilt in the &quot;not far enough&quot; direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The telephone poll was conducted May 17 to 20 among a random national sample of 1,004 adults. The margin of sampling error for the full poll is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The margin is four points for the sample of 874 registered voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign's two-minute commercial featuring steelworkers who lost their jobs after Bain Capital bought their company has many elements of the quintessential attack ad: somber music, old black-and-white photos, even references to blood and vampires. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one thing it does not have is much actual broadcasting time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has only $150,000 behind the ad, showing it in one state - Ohio - for a four-day run that is scheduled to end on Friday. But you wouldn't know it, judging by all the attention the ad has received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's attacks on Mr. Romney's record as a private equity executive - whether through television advertising, his own remarks or comments by surrogates like Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. - have dominated the news this week. Broadcast and cable news outlets have played excerpts from the ad repeatedly in recent days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as campaigns often do with some of their more provocative advertising, Mr. Obama's team has left it to the news media to broadcast the campaign's work, getting a bigger return on a small investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Kantar Media, the two-minute commercial has appeared on television just 33 times since the campaign first began showing it on May 16. That first round of ads had an even smaller amount of money behind it. A 60-second version has been shown 32 times since then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To put those numbers in perspective, another ad the president is running in Ohio about a laid-off auto worker who was rehired after the government rescued General Motors and Chrysler has been broadcast nearly 400 times in the last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7:08 p.m. Updated : An Obama campaign official said Wednesday evening that its Bain ad has been ''so effective'' that its run on Ohio television was being extended a second time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an advertisement released this month by President Obama's campaign, Mitt Romney and the private equity firm he co-founded, Bain Capital, are painted as vampires. They sucked the lifeblood out of GST Steel in the 1990s, which pushed it into bankruptcy, destroying jobs and eliminating pensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a quick counterattack, the Romney campaign released an ad that highlighted the robust job growth at another Bain investment, the manufacturing company Steel Dynamics. The ad featured employees who said the investment had helped them achieve the American dream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, which version of private equity is true? The answer, of course, is both. The business of private equity firms is buying and selling companies, all done with the goal of earning big returns for themselves and their investors. Sometimes that means jobs are created; sometimes it means jobs are lost. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, job creation was actually never part of the industry's mission statement, just a nice happenstance if it occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world of private equity is a nuanced, complicated business that will never be fully captured in anybody's ads this political season. Yet, despite the debate swirling around it, private equity plays a central role in the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each day when millions of Americans eat at Burger King, stay at a Hilton hotel, or visit an HCA-owned hospital, whether they know it or not, they are intersecting with private equity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry has exploded in scale and scope in recent years with some $3 trillion in global assets. The 2,600 private equity firms in the United States are invested in 15,300 companies and employ about 8 million people, according to the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, the industry's lobbying arm. Some of the largest private equity firms -- the Blackstone Group, the Carlyle Group, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company -- oversee global empires that rival some of the mightiest public corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet more than three decades after private equity burst onto the scene in the merger mania of the 1980s, the industry remains as mysterious and controversial as ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The industry has done a terrible job of explaining what it does, and now it has this bright spotlight being shown on it that no one really ever anticipated,'' said Colin C. Blaydon, director of the Center for Private Equity and Entrepreneurship at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is said that private equity is a business of other people's money. Most private equity firms raise money from outside investors that they then combine with large amounts of money borrowed by the companies they are acquiring. Sometimes they install new management and wring out excess costs, which can include slashing jobs. Other times they invest in new plants and create new jobs. After a few years, they either sell the company or take it public again, ideally at a profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyout firms make their money through three different avenues: They charge their investors an annual management fee; they earn a share of any profits; and they can take lucrative advisory and other fees from the companies they acquire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those fat fees have caused many of private equity's detractors to say the industry has minted millionaires and even a handful of billionaires at the expense of ordinary Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their eyes, private equity is still the ''Barbarians at the Gate,'' a book about the late 1980s buyout of RJR Nabisco, and its preferred modus operandi is ''stripping and flipping.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That robber baron image was not helped a few years ago when the Blackstone Group co-founder Stephen A. Schwarzman gave himself a multimillion-dollar birthday party that included a performance by Rod Stewart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the titans of the industry argue that they save and create jobs by sometimes acquiring troubled companies that might have gone under if not for the new money and fresh ideas private equity injected into them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the notion that the buyout titans are enriching only themselves, they are quick to point out that their biggest investors are public pension funds that are seeking high returns to pay benefits down the road to state and municipal retirees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the question of whether private equity has created more jobs than it has eliminated, one of the most-quoted academic studies comes out basically a wash. A study by researchers from Harvard, the University of Chicago and elsewhere of private-equity-owned companies from 1980 to 2005 concluded that private equity did not add more jobs than other companies, but it did not shed significantly more jobs either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other recent studies suggest that some of the more controversial practices of private equity may not do as much harm as is often perceived. For instance, critics have long hammered private equity as loading companies up with mountains of debt that often leaves them teetering on the edge of the financial abyss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a study released last year by a group of researchers that examined companies with high levels of debt between 1997 and 2010 showed private-equity-owned companies did not default at higher levels than their similarly burdened counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same study also said that the often-vilified practice of companies issuing new debt in order to pay dividends to their buyout owners also did not put the companies at greater financial peril.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, one area of criticism that continues to dog the private equity leaders and firms is their low tax rate. The hefty borrowings that companies take on during a buyout often provide the private equity firms with tax-deductible interest payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the fees the industry earns if it hits performance targets is taxed at the lower 15 percent capital gains rate. Ordinary income, like wages and salaries, are subject to a tax rate of up to 35 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the scenes, private equity officials say the industry has evolved. They argue that state officials who oversee public pension money have pressured them to improve the operations of the companies they own rather than rely on balance-sheet somersaults to make their returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the dueling ads, in the case of GST Steel, a manufacturer based in Kansas City, Mo., that Bain bought in 1993, the company, according to a Reuters article this year, issued new debt that was used to pay tens of millions of dollars in dividends to its buyout owners. That sent GST's debt levels and interest payments soaring, which eventually pushed it into bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the bankruptcy was announced, the company also said that it was shutting down a mill, resulting in the loss of hundreds of jobs, and that it would not provide workers with severance pay, health insurance and other benefits. The company's underfunded pension was eventually bailed out by the federal government. But not explored in the campaign ad is that GST was a company already well in decline in an industry under pressure from cheap global product before Bain acquired it and pumped money into it. It was one of many steel manufacturers that filed for bankruptcy during the period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mitt Romney retired from Bain Capital over 13 years ago,'' Bain said in a statement, ''but we understand that in a political campaign our exemplary 28-year record will be distorted and complex business situations will be portrayed in a simplistic way.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the second time in a week, Mitt Romney has offered a series of explicit promises about what he would do on his first day in the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He might want to chat with President Obama before going any further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama made a big show of fulfilling his campaign promises right away. He put broad new restrictions on lobbyists in his first full day in office. And a day later, he banned torture and set in motion a plan to close the terrorist detention facility at Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the public relations benefits of immediately doing what he promised quickly gave way to the harsh realities of governing in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's action on lobbyists and ethics was quickly waived in the case of a senior Defense Department appointee. And his choice to run the Department of  Health and Human Services, Tom Daschle, had to withdraw amid questions about his long connections to the lobbying world.<BR><BR>And his executive order to begin the process of closing the Guant&aacute;namo prison? That hasn't worked out quite as he wanted, in large part because of Congressional interference. The detention center remains open three and a half years later, a  reminder of a promise broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. Obama would point out that the president made good in those first days on some of his promises on government transparency. An executive order on the first full day in office ordered the eventual release of the White House visitor logs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama's experience is a cautionary tale for Mr. Romney, whose promises are - if anything - more explicit than the ones that Mr. Obama made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his new ad, Mr. Romney pledges that on his first day he will announce &quot;deficit reductions,&quot; stand up to China, and begin &quot;repealing job-killing regulations.&quot; In an earlier ad last week, he said the already full day would start with approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, the introduction of tax cuts and the issuing of an order to &quot;begin replacing Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's possible that he could try to do all of those on his first day (or, more likely, his first few days.) But it's also likely that many of those would quickly face roadblocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to cut taxes and reduce the budget deficit have become cataclysmic fights in Congress, and there's little reason to think that proposals by Mr. Romney on Day One would be treated differently. And Mr. Romney would start in office just weeks after what is expected to be an explosive lame-duck session of Congress that would already have dealt with many of those issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidents who pledge tough words for China and other nations during campaigns often find the diplomatic realities different once they get into office. And on Day One, he won't even have his own ambassador to China in place yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revising and repealing regulations often takes time. Mr. Romney could announce a plan to begin reviewing Obama-era rules, but it's unlikely that many could actually end on Day One.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on the Keystone pipeline, Mr. Romney would have to somehow persuade the departing State Department staff - led by Hillary Rodham Clinton - to vastly accelerate its review of a new route and deliver to Mr. Romney a determination that the pipeline is in the nation's interest. Mr. Romney could then concur with the determination on his first day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, there's the health care overhaul. Mr. Romney initially said on the campaign trail that he would issue waivers to all 50 states to allow them not to implement Mr. Obama's health changes. That didn't go far enough for many conservatives, and Mr. Romney began pledging to repeal the law on Day One.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is that repeal would take Congressional action that would be very unlikely if the Senate or the House is in Democratic hands. And it might still be unlikely if Democrats are barely in the minority in both houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any event, a repeal would take months - not hours - and would not happen on Day One.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads are meant to offer voters a sense of what Mr. Romney would be like as president. They end with a narrator saying &quot;that's what a Romney presidency will be like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the news media and the public have a way of taking what presidential candidates say literally - and of trying to hold them to their promises once they get in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. Romney wins the White House, the Day One ads will be with him for a long four years. Just ask Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the days leading up to Facebook's debut, analysts at several banks ratcheted down their growth estimates for the social network. The move came after the company told them that quarterly and annual revenue would be on the softer side, said people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is typical in the I.P.O. process, research analysts at Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and other firms contacted certain clients to discuss their revised expectations, while other big investors called on the banks to get their new take. But ordinary mom-and-pop investors did not have the same access to the valuable information. Now, regulators and lawmakers are taking a closer look. DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Potential Legal Exposure in Facebook I.P.O. &nbsp;|&nbsp; The success of shareholder lawsuits is likely to come down to whether there was information provided that needed to be disclosed to all investors and whether Facebook should have given more specific details, Peter J.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buffett's Goldman Deal Is Topic in an Insider Case &nbsp;|&nbsp; Byron D. Trott has spent a career carefully cultivating the image of the discreet investment banker, a behind-the-scenes counselor to some of America's wealthiest businessmen, including his star client, Warren E. Buffett. At Goldman Sachs, Mr. Trott was so vigilant about guarding clients' confidences that he was known to fire underlings who discussed private matters in the bank's elevators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Wednesday, Mr. Trott was forced to speak publicly about one of his biggest and most important deals - Mr. Buffett's $5 billion investment in Goldman during the heart of the financial crisis in September 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trott took the witness stand for about an hour on Wednesday at the insider trading trial of Rajat K. Gupta, the former Goldman director charged with leaking boardroom secrets to his friend and business associate Raj Rajaratnam. Among the accusations is that Mr. Gupta gave Mr. Rajaratnam advance word of Mr. Buffett's Goldman investment. DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1061 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters and critics of President Obama's endorsement of same-sex marriage agree on one thing: He may not be finished evolving on the subject.          Despite his comments that he thinks the matter should be left to the states, many gay rights advocates strongly believe that it must be dealt with nationally - and that Obama is quietly on their side. Conservative critics of the president suspect the same, citing this as one way the president might tack left if reelected.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And some Obama supporters who are uncomfortable with same-sex marriage fear that in a second term, he would come under enormous pressure to back efforts to impose the legalization of such unions at the federal level. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For right now, he has said he is going to leave it to the states. Whether he continues to 'evolve' - his word - toward further action, I can't know that,&quot; said the Rev. Joel Hunter, a spiritual adviser to the president who opposes same-sex marriage. &quot;I can tell you without a doubt there's a lot of fear right now from religious communities . . . about where it's all going to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, they are worried that the president's preference for state-by-state recognition will give way to the view that same-sex marriage is a guaranteed right under the Constitution. That issue is at the heart of a case that could come before the Supreme Court in its term beginning in October: It involves Proposition 8, a voter-approved California constitutional amendment that bans gay marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama opposed Proposition 8. But if the court accepts the case, it could ask the administration for its view on whether marriage is a fundamental right that cannot be withheld from gay couples. Such a finding could sweep away state decisions on same-sex marriage, as well as the bans in 30 state constitutions.          &quot;He'll have to decide whether he believes the Constitution recognizes gays' or lesbians' equality as far as marriage is concerned,&quot; said Theodore B. Olson, a Republican former solicitor general who is a lead lawyer challenging Proposition 8. &quot;That's not reconcilable with leaving it up to the states.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is part of a broader uncertainty stemming from the president's decision this month to come out in favor of same-sex marriage, a shift that has upended the politics of one of the nation's most divisive social issues and injected a wild card into the presidential race.Obama has sought to assure his critics that the announcement was a reflection of his personal opinion and not a call to arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to tell you that part of my hesitation on this has also been I didn't want to nationalize the issue,&quot; he said in a May 9 interview. &quot;What you're seeing is, I think, states working through this issue, in fits and starts, all across the country. Different communities are arriving at different conclusions, at different times. And I think that's a healthy process and a healthy debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Those following the issue are parsing the impact of Obama's endorsement - and trying to suss out how far he may take a matter that is being hotly debated in Congress, in statehouses, in the courts and in living rooms around the nation.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a video ad released by his campaign Wednesday, Obama promises to be a &quot;strong advocate&quot; for the rights of gay couples and to &quot;continue to lean forward&quot; on issues such as adoption and federal benefits for same-sex partners, even as he pledges to protect religious liberties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before he announced his support for same-sex marriage, Obama ended restrictions against gays serving openly in the military, and his Justice Department said it would no longer defend in court the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which bans federal recognition of same-sex unions. The administration said the law violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution, an argument that some say conflicts with the view that states should decide.          &quot;If you believe the matter should be left to the states, that means you think the Constitution permits the states to take a different view,&quot; said Michael McConnell, a constitutional law professor at Stanford University. &quot;I don't see how that can be squared with Attorney General [Eric H.] Holder's claim&quot; that the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional.             </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Obama campaign is making same-sex marriage an election issue. It announced plans Wednesday to reach out to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender voters and to use the issue to paint a stark contrast with the president's presumptive Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, who supports passing a federal constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.          Obama's announcement has already had ripple effects, prompting an endorsement of same-sex unions from the NAACP and fueling calls to add the issue to the Democratic Party's platform this summer.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new Washington Post-ABC News poll suggests that his comments may have increased support for same-sex marriage among blacks, a key Democratic constituency that has generally opposed such unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gay groups praised the president for striking a major blow for their cause and helping them in the fight to win over hearts and minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's to me very clear and unqualified, and not up for debate, that the route that this is ultimately going . . . is going to be to recognize justice and equality,&quot; said Chad Griffin, a Democratic fundraiser and incoming president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group. &quot;I expect that our federal judiciary will side with the side of equality and justice, and I hope the Justice Department will continue to file in the way that they've filed in the DOMA case.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And some Obama supporters who are uncomfortable with same-sex marriage fear that in a second term, he would come under enormous pressure to back efforts to impose the legalization of such unions at the federal level. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For right now, he has said he is going to leave it to the states. Whether he continues to 'evolve' - his word - toward further action, I can't know that,&quot; said the Rev. Joel Hunter, a spiritual adviser to the president who opposes same-sex marriage. &quot;I can tell you without a doubt there's a lot of fear right now from religious communities . . . about where it's all going to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, they are worried that the president's preference for state-by-state recognition will give way to the view that same-sex marriage is a guaranteed right under the Constitution. That issue is at the heart of a case that could come before the Supreme Court in its term beginning in October: It involves Proposition 8, a voter-approved California constitutional amendment that bans gay marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama opposed Proposition 8. But if the court accepts the case, it could ask the administration for its view on whether marriage is a fundamental right that cannot be withheld from gay couples. Such a finding could sweep away state decisions on same-sex marriage, as well as the bansin 30 state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He'll have to decide whether he believes the Constitution recognizes gays' or lesbians' equality as far as marriage is concerned,&quot; said Theodore B. Olson, a Republican former solicitor general who is a lead lawyer challenging Proposition 8. &quot;That's not reconcilable with leaving it up to the states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is part of a broader uncertainty stemming from the president's decision this month to come out in favor of same-sex marriage, a shift that has upended the politics of one of the nation's most divisive social issues and injected a wild card into the presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has sought to assure his critics that the announcement was a reflection of his personal opinion and not a call to arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to tell you that part of my hesitation on this has also been I didn't want to nationalize the issue,&quot; he said in a May 9 interview. &quot;What you're seeing is, I think, states working through this issue, in fits and starts, all across the country. Different communities are arriving at different conclusions, at different times. And I think that's a healthy process and a healthy debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those following the issue are parsing the impact of Obama's endorsement - and trying to suss out how far he may take a matter that is being hotly debated in Congress, in statehouses, in the courts and in living rooms around the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a video ad released by his campaign Wednesday, Obama promises to be a &quot;strong advocate&quot; for the rights of gay couples and to &quot;continue to lean forward&quot; on issues such as adoption and federal benefits for same-sex partners, even as he pledges to protect religious liberties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before he announced his support for same-sex marriage, Obama ended restrictions against gays serving openly in the military,and his Justice Department said it would no longer defend in courtthe 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which bans federal recognition of same-sex unions. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/23/AR2011022303428.html?sid=ST2011022303851&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.comThe administration said the law violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution, an argument that some say conflicts with the view that states should decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you believe the matter should be left to the states, that means you think the Constitution permits the states to take a different view,&quot; said Michael McConnell, a constitutional law professor at Stanford University. &quot;I don't see how that can be squared with Attorney General [Eric H.] Holder's claim&quot; that the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign is making same-sex marriage an election issue. It announced plans Wednesdayto reach out to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender votersand to use the issue to paint a stark contrast with the president's presumptive Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, who supports passing a federal constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's announcement has already had ripple effects, prompting an endorsement of same-sex unions from the NAACP and fueling calls to add the issue to the Democratic Party's platform this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new Washington Post-ABC News poll suggests that his comments may have increased support for same-sex marriage among blacks, a key Democratic constituency that has generally opposed such unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gay groups praised the president for striking a major blow for their cause and helping them in the fight to win over hearts and minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's to me very clear and unqualified, and not up for debate, that the route that this is ultimately going . . . is going to be to recognize justice and equality,&quot; said Chad Griffin, a Democratic fundraiser and incoming president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group. &quot;I expect that our federal judiciary will side with the side of equality and justice, and I hope the Justice Department will continue to file in the way that they've filed in the DOMA case.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The currency of political persuasion is emotion -- and the way President Obama and Mitt Romney are spending it crystallizes their starkly contrasting appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama campaign video shows the president's national political director, Katherine Archuleta, tearfully crediting Mr. Obama with having saved her daughter's life. She portrays the president as a hero of government whose health care law assures her daughter, a cancer survivor, insurance coverage forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A video by a political committee backing Mr. Romney follows a nearly identical tack: evocative music and a tearful description of Mr. Romney as ''the man who helped save my daughter.'' But the testimonial, from a former partner at Bain Capital, depicts Mr. Romney as a hero of business who once shut down his firm to aid search efforts until the partner's missing teenager was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those competing stories are rooted in more than the biographies of the Democratic incumbent, a former professor and community organizer, and his Republican challenger, a onetime financial industry titan. They also reflect the divergent ideologies and core constituencies of the two parties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama champions government as a linchpin of future economic growth and the average American's protector from the excesses and failures of the free market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney condemns government as a menace whose excesses and failures imperil the free market's ability to enhance individual opportunity and make the nation prosperous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each has more negative than positive material to work with. Their back-and-forth is a clash between institutions reduced to equal levels of public disdain after years of economic weakness, Wall Street's collapse and bailout, high unemployment levels and shifting election outcomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pew Research Center poll found in February that only 22 percent of Americans rated the federal government as having a positive effect on American life -- precisely the same proportion who rated banks and other financial institutions positively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's clearly a standoff,'' said Pew's pollster, Andrew Kohut, though one involving coalitions of different shapes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blacks and Hispanics were twice as likely as whites to rate government positively, for example, and nearly four times as likely as white evangelicals. Mr. Obama's argument draws stronger support from single women, Mr. Romney's from white men and married women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contours of the partisan debate have grown familiar since Ronald Reagan called government the problem, not the solution, and the 2000 election established how closely it divides the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But each side sees an opening for a breakthrough in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Romney team, it is the juxtaposition of a Democratic incumbent struggling with hard times against a Republican candidate uniquely suited to extend the arc of conservative ascendancy that began with Reagan's antigovernment campaign in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We haven't had a candidate that's been as successful from a business standpoint as Romney has been,'' said Carl Forti, a strategist for the pro-Romney ''super PAC'' that produced the advertisement featuring his business partner. As hostile as swing voters may be toward Wall Street and big corporations, he added, ''they absolutely know government's worse.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Obama's advisers, the opening lies in their ability to tie Mr. Romney to the market's generation-long failure to deliver rising living standards to average Americans. ''The country tried everything Romney says, and it brought the economy to the brink of collapse,'' said Mr. Obama's pollster, Joel Benenson. ''The American people know our country has a big role to play in investing in education, in R&amp;D to produce new industries and in infrastructure.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That explains the Obama campaign's recent attack on Mr. Romney's record at Bain Capital. An Obama campaign video with sorrowful former steelworkers cast Mr. Romney as a corporate ''vampire'' who with his partners bought a Missouri manufacturer, siphoned away profits for themselves and bankrupted it. Mr. Obama's defense this week of his campaign's Bain attacks underscored the ideological clash. The president asserted that pursuit of private-sector profits was insufficient preparation for service as chief executive of government, who is obliged to consider the interests of all constituents, including workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign answered that tale of villainy with one of heroism. Its ad highlighted a different company that ''Mitt Romney's private-sector leadership team'' helped start, creating 6,000 jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If that's not the American dream, I don't know what is,'' a grateful worker concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The route to the American dream sketched by Mr. Obama involves critical assistance from the government. In an interactive Obama campaign graphic, the fictional character ''Julia'' benefits from programs like Head Start, small-business subsidies and the new health care law. The campaign recently spent $1 million on a targeted mailing to women in swing states trumpeting benefits they would lose if Mr. Romney won a repeal of the health law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney dismissed the ''Julia'' device as an illustration of the centrality of government to Mr. Obama's vision. He said at a rally this year, ''If you're looking for free stuff you don't have to pay for, vote for the other guy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama promotes the two-year-old financial regulation law as protection against the depredations of Wall Street, with all the more urgency after JPMorgan Chase's recent multibillion-dollar trading loss. Mr. Romney insists that the law inhibits private-sector-led growth and supports its repeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He takes the same view of the government's involvement in bailing out auto companies, saying it rewarded unions friendly to Democrats at the taxpayers' expense; his campaign's new Web video features nonunion workers complaining that Washington had not helped them. Mr. Obama says the government bailout saved the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides supplement philosophical arguments with practical ones. Mr. Romney casts the administration's interventions as simply ineffective; Mr. Obama's campaign says Mr. Romney failed to deliver on jobs and government-slimming promises as governor of Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet they consistently offer voters a fundamental contrast of outlook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama wants government to enhance opportunity and temper inequality through investments in education, research, infrastructure and new energy technologies -- paid for with help from higher taxes on the wealthy. Mr. Romney, speaking in Des Moines last week, articulated the opposite view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The private sector is by far the most efficient and cost-effective'' at generating economic growth, Mr. Romney said. ''As President Obama and old-school liberals absorb more and more of our economy into government, they make what we do more expensive, less efficient and less useful.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They make America less competitive,'' he concluded. ''You do not owe Washington a bigger share of your paycheck.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT OBAMA started his general election campaign by taking aim at Mitt Romney's job creation record at Bain, setting off a lively debate over the fairness of the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am among those who have been drawn into the argument -- there was even a snippet of me defending private equity in a Romney campaign ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a former Obama administration official, I was uncomfortable about being used in a Romney&nbsp;ad in support of his position. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, I was also concerned that the Obama ads, while narrowly accurate, might be seen to portray Bain Capital (and implicitly, private equity) in an ugly light because a few of the companies the firm invested in went bankrupt while Bain Capital still made money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Mr. Obama struck the right balance, emphasizing that he wasn't attacking private equity but was questioning Mitt Romney's Bain Capital credentials to be the job creator in chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's fair, particularly because Mr. Romney himself has been foolishly reweaving history to claim, as recently as last week, that he helped create 100,000 jobs during his time at Bain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Bain Capital -- like other private equity firms -- was founded and managed for profit: ideally, huge amounts of gain earned legally and legitimately. Any job creation was a welcome but secondary byproduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The language in one prospectus seeking Bain Capital investors was clear: ''The objective of the Fund is to achieve an annual rate of return on invested capital in excess of the returns generated'' by other investments. Any job creation was accidental.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mr. Romney's case, his jobs assertion rests heavily on just a few early investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally hatched to provide venture capital to young enterprises, Bain Capital notched a few such successes, notably Staples and Sports Authority. These were small stakes in companies -- about $2.5 million in Staples -- over which Bain had little influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I defend the role financiers play in making our economy work, I also concede that Mark Zuckerberg was far more central to the success of Facebook and its 3,200 jobs than the venture capitalists who invested early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Bain Capital sold off those early investments years ago, Mr. Romney takes credit for every job ever created at every company Bain Capital invested in during his tenure -- while ignoring jobs eliminated after his departure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The steel factory closed down two years after I left Bain Capital,'' he said last week about GST Steel, the Kansas City, Mo., company that went bankrupt in 2001. ''I was no longer there, so that's hardly something which is on my watch.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, when Staples went public in 1989, it had 1,100 employees; at the end of 1998, right before Mr. Romney exited Bain, it had 42,000 workers. Yet Mr. Romney takes credit for the 89,000 employed at the close of 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the years clicked by, Bain Capital and Mr. Romney smelled the chance to make more money by raising larger amounts. That, in turn, led them toward classic leveraged buyouts -- the purchase, often heavily financed by debt, of more established companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These enterprises were often what Wall Street describes as ''undermanaged,'' which means the Bain Capital team could take ''aggressive action'' that often included cutting costs -- read: jobs -- to increase profitability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not wrong; it's part of capitalism. Whatever its flaws, private equity has made a material contribution to sharpening management. But don't confuse a leveraged buyout with job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Mr. Romney's leadership, Bain Capital engaged in the less attractive practice of putting more debt on seemingly successful investments in order to take dividends out. In at least four instances of Bain Capital investments during Romney's tenure, these ''recapped'' companies, of which two were featured in the Obama ads, subsequently went bankrupt, costing thousands their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, some of Bain's large leveraged buyouts -- notably, Domino's Pizza -- added jobs. But Mr. Romney left Bain Capital two months after the Domino's investment (7,900 new jobs claimed) was finalized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aware of private equity's reputation, Mr. Romney still trots around the country erroneously calling himself a ''venture capitalist.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in a further effort to deflect attention from the Bain Capital debate, Mr. Romney last week argued that President Obama was responsible for the loss of 100,000 jobs in the auto industry over the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's both ridiculously false (auto industry and dealership jobs have increased by about 50,000 since January 2009) and a remarkable comment from a man who said that the companies should have been allowed to go bankrupt and that the industry would have been better off without President Obama's involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding jobs was never Mitt Romney's private sector agenda, and it's appropriate to question his ability to do so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook I.P.O. Raises Regulatory Concerns &nbsp;|&nbsp; The Facebook initial public offering was supposed to be Morgan Stanley's crowning achievement, but it is turning out to be a big embarrassment, raising broader questions from regulators about the I.P.O. process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rival bankers and big investors have complained that Morgan Stanley botched the debut. They contend the bank set the price too high and sold too many shares to the public. Facebook's management team is also shouldering some blame. David Ebersman, the company's chief financial officer, spent more than a year orchestrating the stock offering, drafting the prospectus and meeting with investors long before the company picked its bankers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's fate as a public company is hardly sealed. Many newly public companies stumble out of the gate and later become top performers with appealing stocks, a group that includes Amazon.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But regulators are concerned that banks may have shared information only with certain clients, rather than broadly with investors. On Tuesday, William Galvin, the secretary of state in Massachusetts, subpoenaed Morgan Stanley over discussions with investors about Facebook's offering. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-regulator, is also looking into the matter. And the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary L. Schapiro, said on Tuesday that the agency would examine issues related to Facebook's I.P.O., but she did not elaborate. DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Rules for Prepaid Debit Cards &nbsp;|&nbsp; The nation's consumer financial watchdog is preparing restrictions on prepaid debit cards, a largely unregulated product that is flourishing even amid concerns about high fees and poor disclosures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is expected to introduce a preliminary rule for prepaid products, the first of its kind. The bureau, which is expected to complete an overhaul in the next year, will also hold a hearing on Wednesday in Durham, N.C., that will feature testimony from consumer advocates and some of the card industry's biggest players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, prepaid cards have escaped the regulations passed after the financial crisis. As new rules have taken aim at credit cards and traditional debit cards, a number of banks barreled into the prepaid market.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1337 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Brooks and Collins stay positive as they dissect the advertising strategies of the Obama and Romney campaigns, not to mention the super PACs waiting in the (left and right) wings. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail Collins: David, why do you think there's so much negative campaigning? The crazy billionaires who want their own nutty super PAC? The years-long presidential races where the candidates just run out of stuff to talk about? Our fraying national moral fiber? Or is it just because it works?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Brooks: The conventional view is that it works. My view is that it works in some cases. Obama ran plenty of negative ads in 2008, but he won because he rejected the sort of stale campaigning everyone is disgusted by. Now he is running exactly the sort of campaign he once rejected. I don't see how going against your core identity can be a good thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: Well, he thought he could end pointless partisan bickering, too.<BR><BR>David: The thing that actually surprises me most is a shift in morals. Of course politicians have always lied. But now dishonesty is seen as a sign you are playing the game the way it should be played. A few months ago Romney ran an ad that took some Obama comments about the economy completely out of context. It was blatantly dishonest, but it was meant to show the world how tough Romney was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Obama's&nbsp;ad about Romney's Bain experience makes two claims. First, that the steel company GST was successful until Bain acquired it. That is blatantly false. Second, that Romney dumped people on the street and cut them off when the company shut down. That too is blatantly false. Romney had left Bain by that point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blatant falsity is now seen as a sign that you are a true professional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: Actually, I just brought up the subject in hopes that we could revert to one of our historical discussions, in which I could point out the terrible things the other side said about Grover Cleveland. But let me get current.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: Can I just say that there's been a historic decline in the quality of our Grovers. From Cleveland to Norquist. Pretty sad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: As you know, Mayor Cory Booker of Newark made a big splash over the weekend when he went on Meet the Press and said all the negative campaigning was making him sick. Some Democrats felt he should have said that all the negative campaigning made him sick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: That's because some Democrats, like some Republicans, are partisan hacks. At some point it should be possible for politicians to have an honest opinion about their own party, and not just do the talking points. By the way I don't know if you saw the crawlback video Booker released later in the day, but that was painful to watch. So humiliating to see someone collapse under a bit of pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: Let me ask you about the Republican side. As Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg reported in The Times, Republican strategists were trying to get the billionaire who owns the Chicago Cubs to consider an ad campaign resurrecting the Reverend Wright issue against President Obama. I didn't realize there are still Republicans who are sulking because &nbsp;&quot;crusty old&quot; John McCain wouldn't let them run Rev. Wright ads in 2008. That was pretty much the only shred of the old John McCain that was left in that campaign and I think they should leave it alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: I haven't written much about the Citizens United case, mostly because it is so well ventilated by others at our paper. But it's really awful. One of the truly terrible effects of the decision is that the most reckless and indecent consultants, who have always been floating around the fringes of politics, can now make a great living if they can persuade some billionaire to fund their whack-job ad campaigns.&nbsp; This Wright campaign never got off the drawing board, but a lot of bottom feeders are going to get very rich off Citizens United.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hated the Rev. Wright thing because it was nothing but a ploy to capitalize on some voters' uneasiness about Obama's race. And I'd be equally opposed to seeing the Democrats poke around at discomfort about Mitt Romney's Mormonism. You don't run on a guy's religion. I'm sure the Obama campaign won't, but you do have to watch out for those crazy billionaires. Although this year it does seem that the Republicans have pretty much of a crazy billionaire monopoly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: That's an interesting point. Republican billionaires do seem crazier than Democratic billionaires. On the other hand, I think Democratic millionaires are more full of themselves than Republican millionaires - or at least that's my observation in Santa Monica, Palo Alto and Manhattan. I think it's because Republican millionaires are humbled by the fact that they are not billionaires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Gail:&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's go back to Cory Booker. He was upset about the Obama campaign's Bain Capital ads - an attempt, he seemed to suggest, to &quot;indict private equity.&quot;&nbsp; That was, of course, before Mayor Booker felt compelled to revisit and re-explain and rephrase and re-imagine his remarks. But you pretty much agreed with his initial, pre-revision position, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: You betcha. I think there's an enormous body of research showing that private equity firms increase American productivity without having a dramatic effect on American job levels. Back in the 18th century, Thomas Jefferson waged war on capital markets, but Alexander Hamilton understood that only vibrant capital markets would create enough creative destruction to allow poor boys and girls like him to rise and succeed. Otherwise the same established families would dominate society, generation upon generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail:&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Romney's running on his experience as a businessman, I think going after Bain is totally fair. The nation is going to need to have a conversation about whether Romney made his money by acquiring failing businesses, streamlining them and making them profitable - or whether he bought troubled companies, saddled them with debt, sold their most valuable assets, used the money to give a big payoff to the investors, and then let them sink. Or both of the above. And if it's both, that's very bad for the Romney camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: As I understand Bain's approach, they focused on the firms that were really in the doghouse. There is absolutely no money to be made in acquiring a firm that is already well run. They focused on the really poorly managed companies. As a result they had more failures than their rivals - because some of these companies were terminally ill - but when they succeeded they made a lot more money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail:&nbsp;&nbsp; This debate will have very long legs. But however it turns out, I'm still going to be saying that the government is not very much like a business at all, and that business experience isn't really all that useful in a president. Obama correctly points out that people want an economy that will run well, but they also want a strong safety net for the poor and weak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: I agree with that. In private equity, you get to choose what problems you will tackle. In government you don't. Romney's experience matters only if he can convince us that he will reform government in ways that give people the tools to compete in the dynamic economy that firms like Bain help create.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail: The talents that make for a good businessman aren't all that useful for a president, who needs above all to be able to hold the confidence and affection of the public, and persuade a raft of other egomaniacal politicians that they ought to go along with what he's trying to do. The five presidents whose prior experience came closest to the term &quot;businessman&quot; were Warren Harding, Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter and the two Bushes. You might want to argue whether any given one fit the title exactly, but I think it's fair to say that the group did not, in general, glitter in the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David: George Washington was a decent businessman and Abraham Lincoln was a corporate lawyer. They weren't too bad. But I take your point. The data set is small, but I'd say being a governor is the best preparation for being president. And newspaper columnist. We don't have much management experience, but our omniscience helps counteract that.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The Obama campaign focuses on swing states with a new round of ads. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's campaign on Wednesday rolled out two new ads promoting his achievements, part of a $25 million advertising effort that his campaign unveiled this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one ad, titled &quot;Personal,&quot; Mr. Obama's campaign brags about efforts the president has made to protect Medicare from scams and fraud, and says he is working to &quot;preserve Medicare now and for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad cites the president's upbringing by his grandparents to suggest that his desire to protect health care for the elderly is an important matter to him personally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the other ad, Mr. Obama highlights what he calls a &quot;sacred trust&quot; that the country owes the nation's veterans. The president says in the ad that it's &quot;not enough&quot; to give speeches about veterans when they come home from battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also gives Mr. Obama's campaign the opportunity to once again mention his decision to kill Osama bin Laden. It uses grainy, green-tinted video from the raid while Mr. Obama praises the soldiers who went on the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both ads are part of a broad effort by the campaign to target swing voters in about a dozen battleground states. The campaign has said it will use the $25 million announced earlier entirely for spots designed to highlight the president's record in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Democratic campaign is also waging a fiercely negative campaign against Mitt Romney as well in an effort to describe the Republican as a corporate raider whose business experience does not provide the kind of values Americans want in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, Mr. Obama - and the &quot;Super PAC&quot; backing him - are also running ads featuring the stories of people who were laid off from companies purchased by Mr. Romney's private equity firm, Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Mr. Romney's campaign released a Web video on Wednesday morning titled &quot;Stories from the Obama Economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the video, workers are shown saying they had been laid off or have not been able to find a job.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Campaigns often leave it the news media to air their work, getting a maximum return on a minimal investment. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign's two-minute commercial featuring steelworkers who lost their jobs after Bain Capital bought their company has many elements of the quintessential attack ad: somber music, old black-and-white photos, even references to blood and vampires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one thing it does not have is much actual broadcasting time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has only $150,000 behind the ad, showing it in one state - Ohio - for a four-day run that is scheduled to end on Friday. But you wouldn't know it, judging by all the attention the ad has received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's attacks on Mr. Romney's record as a private equity executive - whether through television advertising, his own remarks or comments by  surrogates like Vice President Joseph R. Biden&nbsp;Jr. - have dominated the news this week. Broadcast and cable news outlets have played excerpts from the ad repeatedly in recent days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as campaigns often do with some of their more provocative advertising, Mr. Obama's team has left it to the news media to broadcast the campaign's work, getting a bigger return on a small investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Kantar Media, the two-minute commercial has appeared on television just 33 times since the campaign first began showing it on May 16. That first round of ads had an even smaller amount of money behind it. A 60-second version has been shown 32 times since then. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To put those numbers in perspective, another ad the president is running in Ohio about a laid-off auto worker who was rehired after the government rescued General Motors and Ford has been broadcast nearly 400 times in the last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7:08 p.m. | Updated : An Obama campaign official said Wednesday evening that its Bain ad has been &quot;so effective&quot; that its run on Ohio television was being extended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT OBAMA isn't backing down from his campaign ad attacking Mitt Romney's private equity firm, Bain Capital.  Actually, &quot;attack&quot; may be too weak a description for a video that likens Bain to &quot;a vampire&quot; and depicts Mr. Romney as a plutocrat who callously destroyed hundreds of steel jobs for his own enrichment. Several prominent members of Mr. Obama's own party thought the commercial was a bit over the top. (Not to mention highly derivative of previous ones financed by backers of Mr. Romney's Republican primary rivals.)           Still, politics ain't beanbag, and, if he's going to tout it as a qualification for the White House, Mr. Romney's business record is indeed fair game. The more pertinent question is what to make of Mr. Obama's defense of the ad, which he offered at a news conference Monday.            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama suggested that he never meant to condemn the private equity business as a whole. &quot;I think there are folks who do good work in that area and there are times where they identify the capacity for the economy to create new jobs or new industries,&quot; he noted. Instead, he added, he meant simply to point out that a career in private equity is not appropriate preparation for the White House. There's a big difference between what it takes to &quot;maximize profits,&quot; a perfectly legitimate goal in the business world, and what it takes to &quot;figure out how everybody in the country has a fair shot,&quot; which is the job of a president, he said. On one level, it's reassuring to learn that the president has a nuanced view of private equity, a business that has been rightly praised for revitalizing many a struggling enterprise - and rightly criticized for loading up many rescued firms with debt to pay off investors. Of course, those investors include public employee unions' pension funds, which had entrusted $220 billion to private equity as of fall 2011, according to Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president accepted $3.5 million in campaign donations from private equity executives in 2008, and additional dollars this time around, so it would have been awkward for him not to concede that private equity does &quot;good work.&quot; As for the ad's depiction of job destruction, economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research found that firms restructured by private equity suffered net job losses over five years only 1 percent greater than other comparable companies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the minute Mr. Obama conceded those complications - admitted, in effect, that the private equity business, like most endeavors, involves tradeoffs, and that its benefits might be shared among more than a handful of fat cats - he undercut his distinction between &quot;maximizing profit&quot; and the common good. He also undercut his case against Mr. Romney, since Bain had its share of success stories on the former Massachusetts governor's watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we're left with is a president who seems content to present an even-handed view of private equity at his news conferences while propounding a much more tendentious one in his campaign advertising. Pointing out that a business career hasn't fully prepared Mr. Romney to be president, in other words, is a long way from suggesting that he's a vampire.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three decades after private-equity firms transformed American business, American politics is finally catching up - breathless and bewildered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past week, the spotlight of the presidential campaign has fallen on Mitt Romney's 15 years as an executive at the private-equity firm Bain Capital. President Obama has at times portrayed Romney, his likely GOP challenger, as a kind of pinstriped vampire who sucked profits out of hapless companies while factories closed and workers suffered.          Romney has cast himself as an enabler of American dreams: His campaign says his work at Bain built businesses and created tens of thousands of jobs.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both campaigns, as well as others in Washington, still seem to be struggling with how to talk about an industry that exaggerates both the good things and the bad things about capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday alone, Democratic Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.) said Romney's firm &quot;did what they were supposed to do.&quot; But Rep. James E. Clyburn (S.C.) - the third-ranking Democrat in the House - likened Romney's work at Bain to rape. &quot;There's something about raping companies and leaving them in debt. . . . I have a real serious problem with that,&quot; he said on MSNBC.                     The Obama campaign said it &quot;strongly disagreed&quot; with Clyburn's characterization.            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), vice chairman of the House Republican Conference and a Romney supporter, condemned Clyburn's comments, saying in a statement that &quot;using the word 'rape' to describe Gov. Romney's record as a job creator is offensive, especially to women.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech later in the day, Vice President Biden argued that Romney's work in private equity is irrelevant for the position he is now seeking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your job as president is to promote the common good,&quot; Biden said in Keene, N.H. &quot;That doesn't mean that private-equity guys are bad guys; they're not. But that no more qualifies you to be president than being a plumber.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's campaign said Tuesday that by attacking Romney's tenure at Bain, Obama is guilty of an &quot;assault on free enterprise&quot; itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's time at Bain Capital is a keystone of his political persona: It defines a candidate who tries to avoid being defined by his wealth, his liberal home state of Massachusetts or his Mormon religion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Obama cast himself as someone who understood politics well enough to fix it. In 2012, Romney has used Bain to make the same argument about the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know what it means to meet a payroll,&quot; he wrote in the introduction to his economic plan. &quot;I know why businesses hire people, and why they become forced to lay them off.&quot;          But all this might be easier if Romney had dealt in pizzas and not pizza companies (Bain purchased Domino's Pizza on Romney's watch). The nature of private equity - its unsentimental focus on &quot;creating wealth,&quot; and the long distance between Bain executives and the workers they oversaw - has complicated the story Romney wants to tell.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In general, private-equity firms invest in other companies, and then use their own smarts and borrowed money to remake them, for sale at a profit. In some cases, that can mean hiring new management, or providing money for a new factory or marketing effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private-equity companies have been a force in American business since the hostile-takeover spree of the 1980s. They boomed again in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as the lifeblood of their efforts - easy credit - became easier than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's campaign has touted Steel Dynamics, an Indiana company that built its first plant after Bain's investment. &quot;Steel Dynamics started with an empty field and a big dream,&quot; the campaign's ad says. But, the ad says, the dream came true only after &quot;Mitt Romney's private-sector leadership team stepped in.&quot;          But sometimes, a private-equity firm may shutter a factory or cut a workforce to reduce costs.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even when the bet goes bad and the company closes, the private-equity firm can often walk away unencumbered. Sometimes, it even walks away with more money than it started with. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Romney's leadership, Bain bought steelmaker GS Industries in 1993 and loaded it with debt while paying millions to Bain investors. It declined and in 2001, after Romney was no longer managing Bain, the company filed for bankruptcy, and more than 700 workers lost their jobs. Obama's campaign has highlighted this company in an ad where one ex-worker says, &quot;It was like a vampire came in and sucked the life out of us.&quot;             Howard Anderson, a lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, said that Romney's allies often say he &quot;created jobs&quot; while at Bain. &quot;No, you guys build wealth,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes you build jobs. Sometimes you eliminate jobs,&quot; Anderson said Tuesday. &quot;What private equity is - and what Bain and the other guys do - it's the best of capitalism, and it's the worst of capitalism. . . . Capitalism doesn't try and do the right thing. Capitalism can be very destructive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two sides of the private-equity business - its booming successes and its deep, devastating failures - make it hard to caricature it as all good or all bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry has been worried about this moment for a long time. Anticipating Romney's candidacy, an industry group began to prepare a stepped-up lobbying and public education campaign last summer. It titled the campaign &quot;Private Equity at Work&quot; and targeted political &quot;opinion leaders,&quot; including lawmakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The industry is not widely understood by the general public and even by some on Capitol Hill,&quot; said Steve Judge, president and chief executive of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, which lobbies for leading private-equity firms. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For both parties, the struggle to frame a moral argument about private equity could affect the vote in November. In a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, 21 percent of voters said that Romney's work with Bain was a reason to support him. The same share said it was a reason to oppose him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And 54 percent - the targets of all this messaging - said it wasn't a major factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This argument also could affect campaign fundraising: Although politicians often seem to have just discovered private equity, their campaign treasurers clearly found it long ago. In 2008, the industry supported Obama over Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and gave more to Democrats overall than Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this year,  the private-equity industry has contributed $23 million - with more than 75 percent of that going to Republicans.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three decades after private-equity firms transformed American business, American politics is finally catching up - breathless and bewildered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past week, the spotlight of the presidential campaign has fallen on Mitt Romney's 15 years as an executive at the private-equity firm Bain Capital. President Obama has at times portrayed Romney, his likely GOP challenger, as a kind of pinstriped vampire who sucked profits out of hapless companies while factories closed and workers suffered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has cast himself as an enabler of American dreams: His campaign says his work at Bain built businesses and created tens of thousands of jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both campaigns, as well as others in Washington, still seem to be struggling with how to talk about an industry that exaggerates both the good things and the bad things about capitalism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday alone, Democratic Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.) said Romney's firm &quot;did what they were supposed to do.&quot; But Rep. James E. Clyburn (S.C.) - the third-ranking Democrat in the House - likened Romney's work at Bain to rape. &quot;There's something about raping companies and leaving them in debt. . . . I have a real serious problem with that,&quot; he said on MSNBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign said it &quot;strongly disagreed&quot; with Clyburn's characterization. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), vice chairman of the House Republican Conference and a Romney supporter, condemned Clyburn's comments, saying in a statement that &quot;using the word 'rape' to describe Gov. Romney's record as a job creator is offensive, especially to women.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech later in the day, Vice President Biden argued that Romney's work in private equity is irrelevant for the position he is now seeking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your job as president is to promote the common good,&quot; Biden said in Keene, N.H. &quot;That doesn't mean that private-equity guys are bad guys; they're not. But that no more qualifies you to be president than being a plumber.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's campaign said Tuesday that by attacking Romney's tenure at Bain, Obama is guilty of an &quot;assault on free enterprise&quot; itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's time at Bain Capital is a keystone of his political persona: It defines a candidate who tries to avoid being defined by his wealth, his liberal home state of Massachusetts or his Mormon religion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Obama cast himself as someone who understood politics well enough to fix it. In 2012, Romney has used Bain to make the same argument about the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know what it means to meet a payroll,&quot; he wrote in the introduction to his economic plan. &quot;I know why businesses hire people, and why they become forced to lay them off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all this might be easier if Romney had dealt in pizzas and not pizza companies (Bain purchased Domino's Pizzaon Romney's watch). The nature of private equity - its unsentimental focus on &quot;creating wealth,&quot; and the long distance between Bain executives and the workers they oversaw - has complicated the story Romney wants to tell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In general, private-equity firms invest in other companies, and then use their own smarts and borrowed money to remake them, for sale at a profit. In some cases, that can mean hiring new management, or providing money for a new factory or marketing effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private-equity companies have been a force in American business since the hostile-takeover spree of the 1980s. They boomed again in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as the lifeblood of their efforts - easy credit - became easier than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's campaign has touted Steel Dynamics, an Indiana company that built its first plant after Bain's investment. &quot;Steel Dynamics started with an empty field and a big dream,&quot; the campaign's ad says. But, the ad says, the dream came true only after &quot;Mitt Romney's private-sector leadership team stepped in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sometimes, a private-equity firm may shutter a factory or cut a workforce to reduce costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even when the bet goes bad and the company closes, the private-equity firm can often walk away unencumbered. Sometimes, it even walks away with more money than it started with. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Romney's leadership, Bain bought steelmaker GS Industriesin 1993 and loaded it with debt while paying millions to Bain investors. It declined and in 2001, after Romney was no longer managing Bain, the company filed for bankruptcy, and more than 700 workers lost their jobs. Obama's campaign has highlighted this company in an adwhere one ex-worker says, &quot;It was like a vampire came in and sucked the life out of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howard Anderson, a lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, said that Romney's allies often say he &quot;created jobs&quot; while at Bain. &quot;No, you guys build wealth,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes you build jobs. Sometimes you eliminate jobs,&quot; Anderson said Tuesday. &quot;What private equity is - and what Bain and the other guys do - it's the best of capitalism, and it's the worst of capitalism. . . . Capitalism doesn't try and do the right thing. Capitalism can be very destructive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two sides of the private-equity business - its booming successes and its deep, devastating failures - make it hard to caricature it as all good or all bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry has been worried about this moment for a long time. Anticipating Romney's candidacy, an industry group began to prepare a stepped-up lobbying and public education campaign last summer. It titled the campaign &quot;Private Equity at Work&quot; and targeted political &quot;opinion leaders,&quot; including lawmakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The industry is not widely understood by the general public and even by some on Capitol Hill,&quot; said Steve Judge, president and chief executive of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, which lobbies for leading private-equity firms. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For both parties, the struggle to frame a moral argument about private equity could affect the vote in November. In a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, 21 percent of voters said that Romney's work with Bain was a reason to support him. The same share said it was a reason to oppose him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And 54 percent - the targets of all this messaging - said it wasn't a major factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This argument also could affect campaign fundraising: Although politicians often seem to have just discovered private equity, their campaign treasurers clearly found it long ago. In 2008, the industry supported Obama over Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and gave more to Democrats overall than Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this year,  the private-equity industry has contributed $23 million - with more than 75 percent of that going to Republicans.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The ad is the work of two of the most fearsome players in Republican politics: Larry McCarthy, the producer behind the infamous Willie Horton commercial in 1988, and Crossroads GPS, the political battle squad founded by Karl Rove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it makes its debut Wednesday in 10 swing states as the centerpiece of a $25 million campaign, it is expected to become one of the most heavily broadcast political commercials of this phase of the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet what Mr. McCarthy and Crossroads have produced is not the kind of searing denunciation of President Obama that their track records would suggest. More soft-pedal than Swift Boat, the 60-second advertisement, complete with special effects, is a deeply researched, delicately worded story of a struggling family; its relatively low-key tone is all the more striking, coming at a point in the campaign when each side is accusing the other of excessive negativity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the story of the ad's creation rests one of the greatest challenges for Republicans in this election: how to develop a powerful line of attack against a president who remains well liked even by people who are considering voting against him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concept for the newest advertisement and even some of the lines in the script were culled directly from focus groups of undecided and sometimes torn voters that were held over nearly a year. As Crossroads strategists would learn after 18 different focus groups and field tests, from Missouri to Colorado to Ohio to Florida, the harshest anti-Obama jabs backfire with many Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Middle-of-the-road voters who said they thought the country was on the wrong track were unmoved when they heard arguments that the president lacks integrity. And they did not buy assertions that he is a rabid partisan with a radical liberal agenda that is wrecking America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They are not interested in being told they made a horrible mistake,'' said Steven J. Law, president of Crossroads GPS and the affiliated ''super PAC,'' American Crossroads. ''The disappointment they're now experiencing has to be handled carefully.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In interviews with voters, Crossroads strategists picked up on some common sentiments that they concluded could provide a clear rationale for voters to deny Mr. Obama a second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some said they felt that the president was an eloquent communicator, but that his actions had failed to live up to his words. They said they thought the country's budget problems had gotten out of hand, yet the government kept spending recklessly -- like someone with maxed-out credit cards. And they reported being worried that their children would not have the same opportunities to get ahead as they had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these thoughts made their way into Mr. McCarthy's script. But one exchange in particular, at a focus group in St. Louis in October, gave Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Law the idea for the ad, which they named, innocuously enough, ''Basketball.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman described how her 32-year-old son, burdened by student loans and unable to make ends meet, had moved back home. ''That particular group had several women who basically told the same story,'' Mr. McCarthy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The script, which he started writing that day in October, features a composite character from the focus groups. ''Kind of like President Obama's girlfriends,'' he noted dryly, referring to Mr. Obama's acknowledgment that a girlfriend he referred to in his book ''Dreams From My Father'' was a composite of several women he knew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad opens with a woman talking about her family's financial woes. ''I always loved watching the kids play basketball,'' the actress says, her voice heavy with worry as she glances out at her backyard. ''I still do, even though things have changed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her face quickly morphs into an old woman's. Her skin is wrinkled, her hair gray. She explains how her adult children have moved back into the house because they are unable to find jobs. And she is not sure she can afford to retire now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I supported President Obama because he spoke so beautifully,'' she says. ''He promised change. But things changed for the worse.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, dismissed the commercial's premise. ''However many millions Mitt Romney's special interest allies spend won't change the facts,'' he said, noting that the economy has strengthened considerably since 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In previous presidential campaigns, Republicans have relished mocking their Democratic opponents. They made commercials with video of Michael S. Dukakis riding in a tank wearing an oversize helmet, leaving viewers with images that many thought made him look silly and unpresidential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They used pictures of Senator John Kerry windsurfing to create ads that ridiculed him as a flip-flopper. Bill Clinton, with his admission of drug use, accusations of draft dodging and extramarital affairs, was easily lampooned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Republicans acknowledge that they have always faced a more complicated target in Mr. Obama, whose candidacy four years ago struck a deep emotional chord with many Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why the Crossroads ad features a heavy repetition of the word ''change.'' Many participants in the focus groups cited the Obama mantra of hope and change as a reason they supported him in 2008, but they said they now felt let down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Criticizing President Obama is a challenging proposition in terms of ads because a lot of your swing voters this year voted for him in 2008,'' Mr. McCarthy said. ''They genuinely liked him, they thought he had the right message, they thought he was different.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Basketball'' is similar in its message and tone to a commercial Mr. McCarthy produced for Crossroads last year called ''Wake Up.'' That ad opens with a shot of a clock showing the time as 3:01 a.m., a nod to the famous ''3 a.m.'' ad that Hillary Rodham Clinton used in 2008 to try to portray Mr. Obama as unprepared for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actress in ''Wake Up'' says, ''Sometimes it's hard to sleep,'' as she climbs out of bed to check on her sleeping daughter. ''Lately, I worry a lot about my kids. What's their future going to be like?'' The ad tested higher with voters than any Crossroads had ever produced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using actors is not a common tactic for political attack ads, which often rely on stern-sounding announcers to recite a series of damning facts or on testimonials from aggrieved citizens, like a recent series from the Obama campaign that questions Mr. Romney's history as a private equity executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in this case, Crossroads felt that a scripted story would soften a tough message about complicated issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The challenge is obviously that the issues we want to talk about -- health care, the economy, debt -- it's not like kittens and adoption. They're tough issues to communicate in a warm way,'' Mr. Law said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fictional family also allowed for more creative flexibility in creating a rebuttal to the president's message that although things may not be great, the country is moving in the right direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alternative point of view the Republican strategists are trying to sell to voters is a hard truth wrapped in soft packaging: even though the headlines might be looking good now, the American dream is still in tatters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There are some who believe he's made things worse; then there's a larger group of people who are upset at him because he hasn't fixed these problems,'' Mr. Law said. ''And the larger point of these ads is that the agenda he's pursued has not made things better.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forty years ago, corporate America was bloated, sluggish and losing ground to competitors in Japan and beyond. But then something astonishing happened. Financiers, private equity firms and bare-knuckled corporate executives initiated a series of reforms and transformations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process was brutal and involved streamlining and layoffs. But, at the end of it, American businesses emerged leaner, quicker and more efficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we are apparently going to have a presidential election about whether this reform movement was a good thing. Last week, the Obama administration unveiled an attack ad against Mitt Romney's old private equity firm, Bain Capital, portraying it as a vampire that sucks the blood from American companies. Then Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. gave one of those cable-TV-type speeches, lambasting Wall Street and saying we had to be a country that makes things again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama attack ad accused Bain Capital of looting a steel company called GST in the 1990s and then throwing its workers out on the street. The ad itself barely survived a minute of scrutiny. As Kimberly Strassel noted in The Wall Street Journal, the depiction is wildly misleading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company was in terminal decline before Bain entered the picture, seeing its work force fall from 4,500 to less than 1,000. It faced closure when Romney and Bain, for some reason, saw hope for it in 1993. Bain acquired it, induced banks to loan it money and poured $100 million into modernization, according to Strassel. Bain held onto the company for eight years, hardly the pattern of a looter. Finally, after all the effort, the company, like many other old-line steel companies, filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001, two years after Romney had left Bain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the story of a failed rescue, not vampire capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the larger argument is about private equity itself, and about the changes private equity firms and other financiers have instigated across society. Over the past several decades, these firms have scoured America looking for underperforming companies. Then they acquire them and try to force them to get better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Reihan Salam noted in a fair-minded review of the literature in National Review, in any industry there is an astonishing difference in the productivity levels of leading companies and the lagging companies. Private equity firms like Bain acquire bad companies and often replace management, compel executives to own more stock in their own company and reform company operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the time they succeed. Research from around the world clearly confirms that companies that have been acquired by private equity firms are more productive than comparable firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This process involves a great deal of churn and creative destruction. It does not, on net, lead to fewer jobs. A giant study by economists from the University of Chicago, Harvard, the University of Maryland and the Census Bureau found that when private equity firms acquire a company, jobs are lost in old operations. Jobs are created in new, promising operations. The overall effect on employment is modest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is it true that private equity firms generally pile up companies with debt, loot them and then send them to the graveyard. This does happen occasionally (the tax code encourages debt), but banks would not be lending money to private equity-owned companies, decade after decade, if those companies weren't generally prosperous and creditworthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private equity firms are not lovable, but they forced a renaissance that revived American capitalism. The large questions today are: Will the U.S. continue this process of rigorous creative destruction? More immediately, will the nation take the transformation of the private sector and extend it to the public sector?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While American companies operate in radically different ways than they did 40 years ago, the sheltered, government-dominated sectors of the economy -- especially education, health care and the welfare state -- operate in astonishingly similar ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implicit argument of the Republican campaign is that Mitt Romney has the experience to extend this transformation into government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign seems to be drifting willy-nilly into the opposite camp, arguing that the pressures brought to bear by the capital markets over the past few decades were not a good thing, offering no comparably sized agenda to reform the public sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country that desperately wants change, I have no idea why a party would not compete to be the party of change and transformation. For a candidate like Obama, who successfully ran an unconventional campaign that embodied and promised change, I have no idea why he would want to run a campaign this time that regurgitates the exact same ads and repeats the exact same arguments as so many Democratic campaigns from the ancient past.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO -- Responding to criticism from some Democratic supporters, President Obama said Monday that attacks on Mitt Romney's experience at Bain Capital were fair game and that Mr. Romney's years at the helm of a private equity firm were worthy of serious debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is not a distraction,'' Mr. Obama said about Mr. Romney's record at Bain during a news conference at the end of the NATO summit meeting here. ''This is what this campaign is going to be about.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's comments were his first explicit endorsement of his campaign's aggressive strategy attacking Bain Capital. The Obama campaign's full-throated assault, through ads, statements and Web videos, is now in its second week and portrays Mr. Romney in highly personal and unflattering ways. A video released on Monday highlights an office supply company in Indiana whose workers were fired when it was bought by a Bain company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You can tell by the way he acts, the way he talks,'' one former employee says of Mr. Romney in the new ad. ''He doesn't care anything about the middle-class or the lower-class people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama denied that such attacks were unfair or unjustified, saying Mr. Romney's ''main calling card'' for becoming president was his business experience. He said Mr. Romney's years of buying and selling companies for profit gave him little understanding of the president's role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If your main argument for how to grow the economy is, 'I knew how to make a lot of money for investors,' then you are missing what this job is about,'' Mr. Obama said, putting an emphasis on the words ''this job.'' ''It doesn't mean you weren't good at private equity. But that's not what my job is as president. My job is to take into account everybody, not just some.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus on the Bain attacks has added to the clash between the two campaigns and their allies about the increasingly negative tone of the 2012 presidential campaign, especially as Mr. Obama seeks to define Mr. Romney in the eyes of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Targeting Bain carries risks for the president, not least with wealthy Wall Street executives whose largess in 2008 helped finance his campaign. Some of those supporters have already soured on the president after his efforts to tighten regulation of their industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's comments came a day after Cory A. Booker, the Democratic mayor of Newark, called the Obama campaign's focus on Bain Capital a ''nauseating'' part of negative campaigning on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Booker later made an about-face on Twitter and in a video, saying Mr. Romney's record at Bain was fair game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Republicans were quick to point out how uneasy some in Mr. Obama's own party are about the criticism of private equity investors, and they started an ''I Stand with Cory'' petition to try to embarrass the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''President Obama confirmed today that he will continue his attacks on the free enterprise system, which Mayor Booker and other leading Democrats have spoken out against,'' Mr. Romney said in a statement. ''What this election is about is the 23 million Americans who are still struggling to find work and the millions who have lost their homes and have fallen into poverty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bain Capital was also moved to defend itself, issuing a statement on Monday saying that ''revenues grew in 80 percent of the more than 350 companies in which we have invested.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Mr. Romney said the attacks on his record at Bain were intended to suggest that ''I'm not a good person, or a good guy.'' Mr. Obama's campaign dismissed that criticism, saying its ads and statements were efforts to describe how the values Mr. Romney pursued at Bain would color his actions as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said he views private equity firms like Bain Capital as a ''healthy part of the free market'' that are designed to ''maximize profits.'' He said that among them there are ''folks who do good work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he made it clear that he believes private equity firms put profits above all else, which, he said, is too limited a view at a time of economic struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Their priority is to maximize profits, and that's not always going to be good for businesses or communities or workers,'' Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to his campaign's videos that feature workers laid off by Bain companies, Mr. Obama said, ''I've got to think about those workers in that video just as much as I'm thinking about folks who have been much more successful.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign has also described Mr. Obama in harsh and personal ways. Mr. Romney repeatedly says the president ''doesn't get it,'' painting Mr. Obama as a slow-learning neophyte in the Oval Office. His campaign often accuses the president of personally breaking promises he made to the American people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Republican ''super PACs'' have also targeted Mr. Obama personally. The New York Times reported last week on a plan by one of them to link Mr. Obama to his controversial former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. It was later dropped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns have made it clear that they intend to focus as much on the candidates themselves as the policies they support. Mr. Booker, speaking on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday, said the attacks were crowding out more serious conversations about the economy and other issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''My concern is we are about to go into a significant political campaign that will affect the destiny of our nation,'' Mr. Booker said in his video clarification. ''I am, indeed, upset. I am, indeed, frustrated. But I believe the American public, working together, we can begin to more and more denounce this type of campaigning.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Online Correction: May 21, 2012, Monday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article contained a picture caption that misstated the day on which Mr. Booker issued a video clarifying his remarks about the Obama campaign's focus on Bain Capital. It was Sunday, not Monday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reinstating an Old Rule Is Not a Cure for Crisis &nbsp;|&nbsp; Since JPMorgan Chase announced its surprise $2 billion, and growing, trading loss there have been renewed calls from economists, pundits and politicians to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that prevented commercial banks from participating in investment banking activities, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A meme around Glass-Steagall has been created, repeated so often that it has almost become conventional wisdom: the repeal of Glass-Steagall led to the financial crisis of 2008. And, the thinking goes (the notion has become almost religious for some people), if the law were reinstated, we would avoid the next crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts - basic facts - are just not that convenient. While the repeal of Glass-Steagall has seemingly become the sine qua non of the financial crisis, it is pure historical revisionism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the most recent financial crisis. And it probably would not have prevented JPMorgan's $2 billion-plus trading loss. The loss occurred on the commercial side of the bank, not at the investment bank. But parts of the bet were made with synthetic credit derivatives - something that George Bailey in &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; would never have touched. DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Facebook's Stock Struggles, Fingers Start Pointing &nbsp;|&nbsp; As shares of Facebook tumbled in their second day of trading, bankers, investors and analysts wondered what had gone wrong with the initial public offering of the social network, the most highly anticipated technology debut in years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some fingers are pointing at Morgan Stanley, the lead banker on the I.P.O., while others criticize Nasdaq and even Facebook itself. In the aftermath, critics contend that Facebook's offering price was too high and too many shares were sold to the public, hurting the stock's performance out of the gate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's troubles could damp enthusiasm for a spate of companies set to go public in the coming months. It could also spur changes in the I.P.O. process. In particular, big institutional investors like Fidelity and Vanguard may demand greater say on pricing, at the expense of companies and their bankers. DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>

In any case, matrimonial law experts say that in California, whatever Mr. Zuckerberg earned before the marriage remains solely his property afterward, The New York Times reports. NEW YORK TIMES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe's Worst Nightmare &nbsp;|&nbsp; Landon Thomas Jr. writes in The New York Times: &quot;In a season of nightmare projections for Europe, this one could be the scariest: Greece leaves the euro currency union at the same time Spain's banking system is collapsing.&quot; He continues: &quot;The money available to Europe within its main bailout fund, about 780 billion euros, or $997 billion, would not be enough to handle the twin calamities of a Greek euro exit and a Spanish banking implosion.&quot; NEW YORK TIMES</SPAN></P>

That is a far cry from 2008, when Mr. Obama outspent Senator John McCain by more than two to one and &quot;super PACs&quot; did not exist, Nicholas Confessore, Jo Craven McGinty and Derek Willis report.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Obama aide on Tuesday criticized a new ad by a Republican &quot;super PAC&quot; for featuring a fictional family suffering from President Obama's economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In our ads, we portray real-life stories of Americans who were devastated by the decisions Mitt Romney made,&quot; said the former aide, Bill Burton, who helped found  Priorities USA Action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The target of his ire? An ad by Crossroads GPS that highlights the struggles of a woman whose grown children are forced to move in with her because of the worsening economy during Mr. Obama's tenure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Burton's group has been running ads featuring workers who lost jobs at companies owned by Bain Capital, the private equity firm Mitt Romney used to run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't need actors to know the reality of how Mitt Romney's policies would make life even tougher for middle class families,&quot; Mr. Burton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mr. Burton's group released its own ad featuring a woman who was laid off from an Indiana office supply company after it was bought by Bain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was suddenly 60 years old. I had no health care. And that's scary,&quot; the woman says. &quot;When Mitt Romney did that he, he made, he made me sick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The criticism by Mr. Burton of the Crossroads ad comes after Mr. Obama's campaign received similar flack for creating the character of &quot;Julia&quot; in a Web-based advertisement meant to highlight the impact of Republican policies on young women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney mocked the &quot;Julia&quot; graphic in a speech in Michigan this month, calling it a &quot;cartoon&quot; and dismissed the &quot;imaginary life filled with happy milestones&quot; it portrays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What does it say about a president's policies when he has to use a cartoon character rather than real people to justify his record?&quot; Mr. Romney said in the speech. &quot;What does it say about the fiction of old liberalism to insist that good jobs and good schools and good wages will result from policies that have failed us, time and again?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, the Crossroads ad uses largely the same tactic on Mr. Romney's behalf, inventing a suburban mom who laments that her children can't find jobs and that she can't afford to retire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always loved watching the kids play basketball. I still do, even though things have changed,&quot; the woman says in the ad. &quot;Things changed for the worse. Obama started spending like our credit cards have no limit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Crossroad ad shows pictures of the fictional family on the fireplace mantle as the woman laments Mr. Obama's policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement to reporters, Mr. Burton says of the ad by Crossroads, the group founded by the Republican strategist Karl Rove :</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Romney wins, the fictional woman in Rove's ad would see the 'gradual demise' of her fictional Medicare. Her fictional adult children could no longer be carried on her fictional health insurance, and the student loans for those kids would cost more. And all of that would be so that Romney could give the fictional wealthy -- not portrayed in the ad -- massive tax cuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Priorities USA Action, a pro-Obama &amp;#8220;super PAC,&amp;#8221; revives the highlights &amp;#8212; or, to Mr. Romney, the lowlights &amp;#8212; from the Republican primary. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with a handful of Democrats who have gone off message recently, President Obama's allies on Tuesday sought to shift attention back to Mitt Romney's critics within his own party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Web video released by Priorities USA Action, a pro-Obama &quot;super PAC,&quot; revives the highlights - or, to Mr. Romney, the lowlights - from the extended Republican primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To his onetime Republican rivals, Mr. Romney was an unfeeling corporate raider whose private equity firm, Bain Capital, was little more than a vulture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They sit there and they wait until they see a distressed company and then they swoop in and, you know, pick the carcass clean and then fly away,&quot; said Gov. Rick Perry of Texas during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video strings together similar comments about Bain from Newt Gingrich, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., an adviser to Rick Santorum and Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But will such statements effectively counter the criticism of Mr. Obama from the likes of Cory Booker, the Democratic mayor of Newark? Mr. Booker slammed the president's strategy of attacking Bain Capital, calling it a part of a &quot;nauseating&quot; campaign that is too negative on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Mr. Booker, whose statement came during an unguarded moment on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Republicans delivered their criticism of Mr. Romney and Bain during the heat of the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no doubt that the Republican criticism was tough - in some cases tougher than what Democrats have said about Mr. Romney and his time at the helm of his firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is whether voters view those criticisms from Republicans as honest assessments, or if they shrug them off as all part of a big political game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the former is true, then Democrats might gain some traction from using the Republican voices against Mr. Romney. But if voters are willing to give Mr. Romney's former rivals the benefit of the doubt, the Democratic efforts will probably fizzle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is some evidence to suggest that voters have come to expect intraparty feuds during primaries, and are willing to forgive and forget once they are over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Mr. Obama fought bitterly with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Obama of &quot;tactics right out of Karl Rove's playbook&quot; and once said he was &quot;perpetuating falsehoods that is not the new politics the speeches are about. It is not hopeful, it is destructive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee in 2008, tried to use Mrs. Clinton's words against Mr. Obama in an ad that suggested she was not on the Democratic ticket because she was being punished for speaking the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, though, the ad did little to help Mr. McCain in his battle with Mr. Obama. Voters dismissed the criticisms from Mrs. Clinton, who later went on to become a loyal member of Mr. Obama's administration as secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. Clinton has emerged in the current campaign as one of Mr. Obama's secret weapons. In an e-mail to supporters on Tuesday, Mr. Obama hailed the former president who said such nasty things about him four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel fortunate to have President Clinton on our team today - he's smart, he's tough, and he's committed to strengthening this organization alongside you,&quot; Mr. Obama wrote, asking for a $3 donation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats are hoping that using the words of Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Perry and the others will have a bigger impact on Mr. Romney than the clips of the Clintons had on Mr. Obama four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, the president's campaign advisers are hoping to keep their own troops more in line.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Obama campaign ramped up its attacks on Bain Capital, Mitt Romney's former private-equity firm, the company on Monday took the rare step of defending its record. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm was responding to a new ad that focuses on Ampad, a company purchased by Bain in 1992 that laid off 250 workers at an Indiana plant before going bankrupt in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We acquired Ampad from Mead Corp. in 1992, and grew the overall business during the four years we controlled the company,&quot; Bain's statement said. &quot;Our control of Ampad ended in 1996, fully four years before it encountered financial difficulties due to overwhelming pressure from 'big box' retailers, declines in paper demand, and intense foreign price pressures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-minute video from the Obama campaign describes how, in 1994, the Bain-owned Ampad bought SCM, a hanging-file-folder factory in Indiana. All 250 workers at the SCM plant were quickly laid off and invited to reapply at a lower wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, Bain made nearly $100 million from its investment in Ampad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite political attacks that emphasize the few companies that have struggled, the facts are that during Bain Capital's ownership, revenues grew in 80 percent of the more than 350 companies in which we have invested,&quot; the firm's statement said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             President Obama defended his campaign's attacks on Mitt Romney's record as a private-equity executive at Bain Capital, telling reporters Monday that Romney's history is fair game. The president's remarks came in the face of criticism, some from within his own party, that the attacks were inappropriate.          &quot;My view of private equity is that it is set up to maximize profits, and that's a healthy part of the free market,&quot; Obama said. But, he added, &quot;that's not always going to be good for businesses or communities or workers.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney - the likely Republican presidential nominee - and Bain Capital responded forcefully to the attacks, but it was questions from Democrats that complicated the debate for Obama. Those complications began Sunday when Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a close ally of the president, criticized the Obama campaign for targeting Bain in its ads. Booker equated those attacks with ones using statements by former Obama pastor Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. against the president. Booker decried both as &quot;nauseating.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the Romney campaign put out an ad featuring Booker and Democratic former congressman Harold Ford Jr., who agrees with Booker's statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously, one of Obama's former advisers, Steven Rattner, called the president's attacks on Romney's private-equity career &quot;unfair.&quot; He added in an interview with MSNBC that &quot;Mitt Romney made a mistake ever talking about the fact that he created jobs,&quot; because the purpose of private-equity firms such as Bain is to create wealth, not jobs. Rattner was &quot;car czar&quot; for Obama early in the administration and has been a Wall Street financier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker and Ford have long ties to Wall Street and the world of private equity, which has a history of supporting Democrats. Bain executives, for example, gave generously to Obama in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the firm's executives, and the financial industry in general, are strongly supporting Romney. But during the 2008 election cycle, employees of Bain Capital and Bain &amp; Co. donated $1.47 million to federal candidates, parties and political committees, with two-thirds of that money going to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. During that cycle, the Democratic National Committee collected $215,000 from Bain-related sources, and its GOP counterpart collected $61,650, the center found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate suggests that a big focus of the presidential race will be competing definitions of capitalism, including criticism by Democrats of some of private equity's most lucrative and controversial practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference Monday after a NATO summit in Chicago, Obama was asked about the criticism from Booker, a close ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is part of the debate that we're going to be having in this election campaign,&quot; he said, &quot;about how do we create an economy where everybody from top to bottom, folks on Wall Street and folks on Main Street, have a shot at success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Sunday on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Booker said, &quot;I have to just say from a very personal level, I'm not about to sit here and indict private equity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although he later backed away from the remarks, calling Bain &quot;fair game&quot; for the president, the Romney campaign pounced. The Republican National Committee also highlighted the issue with an online petition titled &quot;I Stand With Cory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking to reporters, Obama said he is making Bain an issue because Romney's &quot;main calling card for why he thinks he should be president is his business experience. . . . When you're president, as opposed to the head of a private-equity firm, then your job is not simply to maximize profits. Your job is to figure out how everybody in the country has a fair shot. Your job is to think about those workers who get laid off, and how are we paying for their retraining. Your job is to think about how those communities can start creating new clusters so that they can attract new businesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executives at Bain and companies like it say they are in business to make money, not to create jobs. Some Democrats openly worry that the criticism of Bain could alienate important donors in private-equity hedge funds and traditional Wall Street firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a Silicon Valley bundler for the president, Wade Randlett, said Monday that Obama's attacks on Bain will help more than they will hurt. &quot;People forget that for every Wall Street financier who would cross over to Romney [because of the attacks], there are two tech execs who are furious about being lumped in with them as a 'one-percenter' &quot; and will support Obama, said Randlett, who said he does not speak for the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the president takes on the private-equity industry, he could rally public anger against Wall Street's unpopular practices and some of its most lucrative non-banking industries. On the other hand, his attacks could be perceived as targeting capitalism itself. U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J. Donohue said that Obama's approach reveals &quot;a failure to understand the role&quot; that private-equity companies play in resuscitating other firms and strengthening the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have long relied on Wall Street donations for support, which has influenced the party's approach to economic, regulatory and tax issues. That support has been particularly important for the financial industry's most outspoken defenders, including Booker and Ford, both of whom have expressed interest in running for statewide office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Newark mayor, for example, has courted support from hedge fund and private-equity donors, according to people familiar with his effort. They have supported Booker's electoral campaigns and aided his efforts to promote school reform. In recent years, Booker sought to raise $100 million to match a grant from Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg to remake Newark's schools.The mayor relied, for example, on William Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, and his wife, who pledged $25 million to the schools cause, according to a report in the Chronicle of Philanthropy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker declined a request for comment Monday afternoon. A spokeswoman, Anne Torres, said any claim that he is beholden to private-equity benefactors is ridiculous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker wrote on Twitter that &quot;I will fight hard for Obama to win. But just as his 08 campaign did, I believe we must elevate &amp; not denigrate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While previous attacks on Romney's time at Bain have produced controversy, they have proved effective. Romney was making headway against Sen. Edward M. Kennedy in his 1994 Senate bid, but his campaign faltered as Kennedy attacked Bain's record of job loss at certain unionized companies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             Mitt Romney has been on a fundraising tear recently, drawing more than $10 million during a swing through New York this week and another $10 million in Florida last week.          With the primary challenge behind him, Romney is partnering with the national and state GOP fundraising apparatus to stretch donation limits beyond the $5,000 that any one person can give to his presidential campaign.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By joining forces with the Republican National Committee and four of its state-level affiliates, Romney is able to raise $75,800 from one person or more than $150,000 from a couple. That puts him on an even playing field with President Obama, who has been doing the same on the Democratic side since last year.In April, Romney's campaign raised $11.5 million and the RNC raised $11.2 million, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Sunday night. The Romney Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee, took in an additional $17.4 million, according to the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          The fund includes state parties in Oklahoma, Massachusetts, Idaho and Vermont. Once they receive the Victory money, they'll transfer it to battleground states for get-out-the-vote efforts, a Romney aide said.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, the $40.1 million raised by Romney and the RNC puts them nearly even with the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee, which brought in a combined $43.6 million in April. Obama has also been fundraising aggressively in May, hosting an event at actor George Clooney's house that reportedly raised about $15 million.Romney has relied heavily on the finance industry to fill his coffers. Records show that his campaign has taken in $3 million from Fairfield County in Connecticut, as much as he's raised from Los Angeles County and topped only by the $5.4 million from Manhattan, according to a Washington Post analysis of federal filings. Fairfield has one of the nation's largest concentrations of hedge funds and other financial firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney was in Connecticut collecting checks on Sunday. He went on Monday to Manhattan, where the campaign held a breakfast for 70 people near Wall Street co-hosted by Gerald Hassell, president of the Bank of New York Mellon. Later, Romney spoke to at least 240 people at a fundraising lunch in the Starlight Room at the Waldorf Astoria in Midtown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney fundraising surge could be a boon to GOP congressional candidates, because Securities and Exchange Commission rules prohibit financial service executives from contributing to state parties as a guard against pay-to-play schemes in state and municipal bond markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's something that everyone in that industry is now highly sensitive to,&quot; said Jason Torchinsky, a Republican campaign lawyer. &quot;One contribution of a couple of thousand dollars could keep your company out of millions of dollars of business. The compliance risk is gigantic for these firms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So some money from finance industry donors will be directed to the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, a Romney aide said. That is in contrast to Obama's campaign, which has said it will not direct funds to House and Senate races.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Obama campaign ramped up its attacks on Bain Capital, Mitt Romney's former private-equity firm, the company on Monday took the rare step of defending its record. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm was responding to a new ad that focuses on Ampad, a company purchased by Bain in 1992 that laid off 250 workers at an Indiana plant before going bankrupt in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We acquired Ampad from Mead Corp. in 1992, and grew the overall business during the four years we controlled the company,&quot; Bain's statement said. &quot;Our control of Ampad ended in 1996, fully four years before it encountered financial difficulties due to overwhelming pressure from 'big box' retailers, declines in paper demand, and intense foreign price pressures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-minute video from the Obama campaign describes how, in 1994, the Bain-owned Ampad bought SCM, a hanging-file-folder factory in Indiana. All 250 workers at the SCM plant were quickly laid off and invited to reapply at a lower wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, Bain made nearly $100 million from its investment in Ampad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite political attacks that emphasize the few companies that have struggled, the facts are that during Bain Capital's ownership, revenues grew in 80 percent of the more than 350 companies in which we have invested,&quot; the firm's statement said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama defended his campaign's attacks on Mitt Romney's record as a private-equity executive at Bain Capital, telling reporters Monday that Romney's history is fair game. The president's remarks came in the face of criticism, some from within his own party, that the attacks were inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My view of private equity is that it is set up to maximize profits, and that's a healthy part of the free market,&quot; Obama said. But, he added, &quot;that's not always going to be good for businesses or communities or workers.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney - the likely Republican presidential nominee - and Bain Capital responded forcefully to the attacks, but it was questions from Democrats that complicated the debate for Obama. Those complications began Sunday when Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a close ally of the president, criticized the Obama campaign for targeting Bain in its ads. Booker equated those attacks with ones using statements by former Obama pastor Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. against the president. Booker decried both as &quot;nauseating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the Romney campaign put out an ad featuring Booker and Democratic former congressman Harold Ford Jr., who agrees with Booker's statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously, one of Obama's former advisers, Steven Rattner, called the president's attacks on Romney's private-equity career &quot;unfair.&quot; He added in an interview with MSNBC that &quot;Mitt Romney made a mistake ever talking about the fact that he created jobs,&quot; because the purpose of private-equity firms such as Bain is to create wealth, not jobs. Rattner was &quot;car czar&quot; for Obama early in the administration and has been a Wall Street financier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker and Ford have long ties to Wall Street and the world of private equity, which has a history of supporting Democrats. Bain executives, for example, gave generously to Obama in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the firm's executives, and the financial industry in general, are strongly supporting Romney. But during the 2008 election cycle, employees of Bain Capital and Bain &amp; Co. donated $1.47 million to federal candidates, parties and political committees, with two-thirds of that money going to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. During that cycle, the Democratic National Committee collected $215,000 from Bain-related sources, and its GOP counterpart collected $61,650, the center found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate suggests that a big focus of the presidential race will be competing definitions of capitalism, including criticism by Democrats of some of private equity's most lucrative and controversial practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference Monday after a NATO summit in Chicago, Obama was asked about the criticism from Booker, a close ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is part of the debate that we're going to be having in this election campaign,&quot; he said, &quot;about how do we create an economy where everybody from top to bottom, folks on Wall Street and folks on Main Street, have a shot at success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Sunday on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Booker said, &quot;I have to just say from a very personal level, I'm not about to sit here and indict private equity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although he later backed away from the remarks, calling Bain &quot;fair game&quot; for the president, the Romney campaign pounced. The Republican National Committee also highlighted the issue with an online petition titled &quot;I Stand With Cory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking to reporters, Obama said he is making Bain an issue because Romney's &quot;main calling card for why he thinks he should be president is his business experience. . . . When you're president, as opposed to the head of a private-equity firm, then your job is not simply to maximize profits. Your job is to figure out how everybody in the country has a fair shot. Your job is to think about those workers who get laid off, and how are we paying for their retraining. Your job is to think about how those communities can start creating new clusters so that they can attract new businesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executives at Bain and companies like it say they are in business to make money, not to create jobs. Some Democrats openly worry that the criticism of Bain could alienate important donors in private-equity hedge funds and traditional Wall Street firms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark, a prominent Democrat enlisted as a surrogate for President Obama's campaign, sharply criticized it on Sunday for attacking Mitt Romney's work at the private equity firm Bain Capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Booker, speaking on the NBC program ''Meet the Press,'' made his comments in response to a television advertisement the president's campaign unveiled last week. It portrays Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, as someone who eliminated jobs for the sake of profits during his years running Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I have to just say, from a very personal level, I'm not about to sit here and indict private equity,'' Mr. Booker said. ''To me, it's just we're getting to a ridiculous point in America, especially that I know I live in a state where pension funds, unions and other people are investing in companies like Bain Capital. If you look at the totality of Bain Capital's record, they've done a lot to support businesses, to grow businesses. And this to me, I'm very uncomfortable with.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The last point I'll make is this kind of stuff is nauseating to me on both sides,'' Mr. Booker continued. ''It's nauseating to the American public. Enough is enough. Stop attacking private equity. Stop attacking Jeremiah Wright.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In mentioning Mr. Wright, Mr. Obama's former pastor in Chicago, Mr. Booker seemed to be referring to a report last week in The New York Times that Joe Ricketts, a billionaire who founded the brokerage firm TD Ameritrade, was considering a plan to finance a $10 million advertising campaign tying Mr. Obama to controversial and racially tinged comments by Mr. Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the plan being considered by Mr. Ricketts was disclosed, it drew sharp criticism not just from Democrats and the Obama campaign but also from Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Booker said: ''This stuff has got to stop, because what it does is it undermines, to me, what this country should be focused on. It's a distraction from the real issues.'' He added that the race would either be a ''small campaign'' about issues like Mr. Wright and Bain, ''or it's going to be a big campaign, in my opinion, about the issues that the American public cares about.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Booker's comments immediately provoked widespread interest among political types on social media, in large part because he seemed to be equating the Obama campaign with Mr. Ricketts, who announced that he was rejecting the ad campaign after The Times published its report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign declined to comment, directing reporters instead to Mr. Booker's Twitter account, where he later wrote: ''Yes, Obama must be re-elected. But we as a nation owe it to him and ourselves to reject politics as usual.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, Mr. Booker responded to his critics in a YouTube video. ''Let me be clear: Mitt Romney has made his business record a centerpiece of his campaign,'' he said. ''Therefore, it is reasonable, and in fact I encourage it, for the Obama campaign to examine that record and to discuss it. I have no problem with that.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes it's hard to explain why we need strong financial regulation -- especially in an era saturated with pro-business, pro-market propaganda. So we should always be grateful when someone makes the case for regulation more compelling and easier to understand. And this week, that means offering a special shout-out to two men: Jamie Dimon and Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll come back shortly to the troubles at JPMorgan Chase, the bank Mr. Dimon runs. First, however, let me talk about Mr. Romney, whose remarks about those troubles were so off-point that they constitute a teachable moment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said about JPMorgan's $2 billion loss (which may actually have been $3 billion, or $5 billion, or more, but who's counting?): ''This was a loss to shareholders and owners of JPMorgan and that's the way America works. Some people experienced a loss in this case because of a bad decision. By the way, there was someone who made a gain.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's wrong with this statement? Well, suppose that someone -- say, Jimmy Stewart in the movie ''It's a Wonderful Life'' -- runs a bank that takes in deposits and invests the money in various ways. And suppose that one of those investments is a risky bet on some complex financial instrument, with Mr. Potter, the evil plutocrat, on the other side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Jimmy Stewart's bet pays off, we're in Romneyworld: he's made money, Mr. Potter has lost money, and that's that. But suppose Jimmy Stewart loses his bet. If the bet was big enough, he no longer has enough assets to pay off his depositors. His bank collapses, probably in a chaotic bank run that takes down the whole town's economy as collateral damage. Mr. Potter makes money on the deal, but so what?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is that it's not O.K. for banks to take the kinds of risks that are acceptable for individuals, because when banks take on too much risk they put the whole economy in jeopardy -- unless they can count on being bailed out. And the prospect of such bailouts, of course, only strengthens the case that banks shouldn't be allowed to run wild, since they are in effect gambling with taxpayers' money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incidentally, how is it possible that Mr. Romney doesn't understand all of this? His whole candidacy is based on the claim that his experience at extracting money from troubled businesses means that he'll know how to run the economy -- yet whenever he talks about economic policy, he comes across as completely clueless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, it goes without saying that Jamie Dimon is no Jimmy Stewart. But he has, in a way, been playing Jimmy Stewart on TV, posing as a responsible banker who knows how to manage risk -- and therefore the point man in Wall Street's fight to block any tightening of regulations despite the immense damage deregulated banks have already inflicted on our economy. Trust us, Mr. Dimon has in effect been saying, we've got this covered and it won't happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the truth is coming out. That multibillion-dollar loss wasn't an isolated event; it was an accident waiting to happen. For even as Mr. Dimon was giving speeches about responsible banking, his own institution was heaping on the risk. ''The unit at the center of JPMorgan's $2 billion trading loss,'' reports The Financial Times, ''has built up positions totaling more than $100 billion in asset-backed securities and structured products -- the complex, risky bonds at the center of the financial crisis in 2008. These holdings are in addition to those in credit derivatives which led to the losses.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what was going on as these positions were being accumulated? According to a fascinating report in Sunday's Times, the reality behind JPMorgan's facade of competence was a scene all too reminiscent of the behavior that brought down firms like A.I.G. in 2008: arrogant executives shouting down anyone who tried to question their activities, top management that didn't ask questions as long as the money kept rolling in. It really is deja vu all over again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point, again, is that an institution like JPMorgan -- a too-big-to-fail bank, not to mention a bank whose deposits are already guaranteed by U.S. taxpayers -- shouldn't be engaged in this kind of speculative investment at all. And that's why we need a return to much stronger financial regulation, stronger even than the Dodd-Frank regulations passed back in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will we get that kind of regulation? Not if Mr. Romney wins, obviously; he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, and in general has made it clear that he would do everything in his power to set us up for another financial crisis. Even if President Obama is re-elected, getting the kind of regulation we need will be an uphill struggle. But as Mr. Dimon's debacle has just demonstrated, that struggle remains as necessary as ever.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gupta Set for Trial in Insider Case &nbsp;|&nbsp; Only a few years ago, Time magazine's list of the world's 100 most influential people could have easily included Rajat K. Gupta, who led the elite management-consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company and was a confidant of corporate chieftains and major philanthropists around the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gupta appears at the top of a very different list today. He is the most prominent criminal defendant ensnared by the Justice Department's sweeping campaign to end insider trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Mr. Gupta is set to stand trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The government has charged him with divulging boardroom secrets to his former friend and business associate Raj Rajaratnam, the former head of the Galleon Group hedge fund. Last year a jury convicted Mr. Rajaratnam of orchestrating an insider trading conspiracy that reaped at least $63 million in illegal gains. He is serving an 11-year prison term, the longest sentence for insider trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Mr. Rajaratnam's illicit sources of information, prosecutors say, was Mr. Gupta, 63, who sat on the boards of Goldman Sachs and Procter &amp; Gamble. Prosecutors contend that on five occasions, Mr. Gupta gave Mr. Rajaratnam advance word of market-moving news about the two companies. In each case, Mr. Rajaratnam illegally traded on the tips, the government says. DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&quot;This is not a distraction,&quot; President Obama said at a news conference, referring to Mr. Romney's Bain record. &quot;This is what this campaign is going to be about.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5:11 p.m. | Updated CHICAGO -- President Obama said that he considered attacks on Mitt Romney's experience at Bain Capital to be fair game, declaring that the former chief executive's claims to being a strong business leader made his background at the private equity firm worthy of a serious debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a distraction,&quot; Mr. Obama said during a news conference at the end of the NATO summit in Chicago on Monday, referring to Mr. Romney's Bain record. &quot;This is what this campaign is going to be about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president has come under criticism from some of his Democratic allies for the Bain attacks. On Sunday, Cory A. Booker, the mayor of Newark, and a top supporter of Mr. Obama, called the president's attacks on Bain a &quot;nauseating&quot; part of negative campaigning on both sides. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Booker said the attacks on Bain Capital in campaign advertisements were unfair, though he later issued an about-face on Twitter and in a video, during which he said that Mr. Romney's record at Bain was actually fair game. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama refused to concede that the attacks were unfair or unjustified, saying that Mr. Romney's limited experience buying and selling companies for profit leaves him with little understanding of the job that a president needs to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If your main argument for how to grow the economy is, 'I knew how to make a lot of money for investors,' then you are missing what this job is about,&quot; Mr. Obama said, stressing the words &quot;this job&quot; in his answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't mean you weren't good at private equity,&quot; Mr. Obama added. &quot;But that's not what my job is as president. My job is to take into account everybody, not just some.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said he views private equity firms like Bain Capital as a &quot;healthy part of the free market&quot; designed to &quot;maximize profits.&quot; He said there are &quot;folks who do good work&quot; in that line of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he made clear that he views those who work in private equity - and Mr. Romney in particular - as limited by a view of the economy that prioritizes profits above all else. The president said that view was too limited at a time of economic struggles in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their priority is to maximize profits, and that's not always going to be good for businesses or communities or workers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referencing the videos his campaign has released in the past two weeks that featured workers laid off by Bain companies, Mr. Obama said: &quot;I've got to think about those workers in that video just as much as I'm thinking about folks who have been much more successful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason why this is relevant,&quot; Mr. Obama said, &quot;is Romney's main calling card for why he should be elected is his business experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's advisers insist that their full-throated assault on Bain Capital, now in its second full week, is intended as a critique of Mr. Romney's claims to be a jobs creator. But much of the commentary on Mr. Obama's behalf describes Mr. Romney in highly personal and unflattering ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That approach has begun to have consequences. On Sunday, Mr. Booker said both campaigns should stop the &quot;crap&quot; they have been offering the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This, to me, I'm very uncomfortable with,&quot; Mr. Booker said on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hours later, Mr. Booker released a three-minute video backing off his criticism and trying to draw a distinction between personal attacks and legitimate criticisms of Mr. Romney's time at Bain. In the video, he said it is &quot;reasonable&quot; for Mr. Obama's campaign to examine his rival's business record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Booker's first instinct may have been influenced by his ties with Wall Street executives, many of whom are his supporters. Other Democrats who have criticized the Bain attacks - like Steven Rattner, Mr. Obama's former auto czar - are also close to the private equity world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the episode involving Mr. Booker suggests that Mr. Obama is walking a fine line as he tries to make Bain Capital a central issue in the presidential campaign. Both candidates are eager to attract independent voters who may be turned off by attacks they think cross a line of decency. And Mr. Romney has jumped at the chance to argue that the president has done just that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Mr. Romney said the Bain attacks from Mr. Obama were intended to suggest that &quot;I'm not a good person, or a good guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican party sought to stoke the issue further on Monday, using video of Mr. Booker's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; comments to raise money with  The Republican National Committee also launched an &quot;I Stand With Cory&quot; petition drive and began using the #StandWithCory hashtag on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. Romney's campaign produced a video alleging that Mr. Obama's supporters have &quot;had enough of President Obama's attacks on free enterprise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign has dismissed that criticism, saying its Web site - RomneyEconomics.com - is an effort to describe how the values Mr. Romney's pursued at Bain would color his actions as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not about private equity or how Romney ran his company,&quot; Stephanie Cutter, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Obama, told reporters recently. &quot;It's about whether his business experience there qualifies him to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the campaign advertisements and conference calls are frequently platforms to question Mr. Romney's personal qualities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A video released Monday by Mr. Obama's campaign highlights an office supply company whose workers were fired when it was bought by a Bain company. In the ad, the workers deride Mr. Romney's personal ethics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One says that Mr. Romney &quot;did not care about us as workers.&quot; Another says that Mr. Romney &quot;takes from the poor and the middle class and gives to the rich. He's just the opposite of Robin Hood.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third says flatly: &quot;You can tell by the way he acts, the way he talks. He doesn't care anything about the middle-class or the lower-class people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another ad, set at a Kansas City, Mo., steel plant, Joe Soptic, a former worker there, says that as president, Mr. Romney &quot;would be so out of touch with the average person in this country.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How could you care? How could you care for the average, working person if you feel that way?&quot; Mr. Soptic says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went even further in a conference call with reporters, saying that Mr. Romney &quot;is only worried about one group of people, and that's people like him, people at the top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The personal criticisms of Mr. Romney also come directly from Mr. Obama's campaign officials. In the conference call with Mr. Soptic, Ms. Cutter said the issue was Mr. Romney's personal values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Romney didn't care about rewarding hard work or responsibilities,&quot; she said. &quot;It's absolutely on the table as an indication of Romney's values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That message is being echoed in &quot;super PAC&quot; advertisements on the campaign's behalf. An ad by Priorities USA Action concludes with a worker saying that Mr. Romney &quot;promised us the same things he's promising the United States. He'll give you the same thing he gave us. Nothing. He'll take it all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, Mr. Romney's campaign has been aggressive in describing Mr. Obama in personal ways. Mr. Romney repeatedly says that the president &quot;doesn't get it,&quot; painting Mr. Obama as a kind of slow-learning neophyte in the Oval Office. His campaign often describes the president as a liar, saying he personally broke promises he made to the American people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Republican super PACs have targeted Mr. Obama personally. The Times reported last week on a plan by one of them to link Mr. Obama to his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question may be whether either campaign is making progress with voters by making the race more about the candidates and less about the policies they pursue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Booker said on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that the trash talk was crowding out more serious conversations about the economy and other issues. And in his video clarification, he continued to urge the candidates to stay away from the personal attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My concern is we are about to go into a significant political campaign that will affect the destiny of our nation,&quot; he said. &quot;I am, indeed, upset. I am, indeed, frustrated. But I believe the American public, working together, we can begin to more and more denounce this type of campaigning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ultimately,&quot; he added, &quot;my hope is that this election will not therefore be about the small things, will not be about divisiveness, will not be about denigrating, will not be about painting with a broad brush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bain Capital issued a statement Monday in response to the new video from Mr. Obama's campaign. Charlyn Lusk, a spokeswoman for the firm, said it has always tried to grow businesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our control of Ampad ended in 1996, fully four years before it encountered financial difficulties due to overwhelming pressure from 'big box' retailers, declines in paper demand, and intense foreign price pressures,&quot; she said. &quot;During Bain Capital's ownership, revenues grew in 80 percent of the more than 350 companies in which we have invested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An earlier version of this post referred incorrectly to Cory A. Booker. He is the mayor of Newark, N.J., not the mayor of New Jersey. It also misspelled the name of President Obama's former auto czar. He is Steven Rattner, not Stephen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Rebecca Donatelli was listed as a member of what was called Your Recommended Team of Pirates in a proposal for an ad campaign aimed at blocking President Obama's re-election. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials with the Republican National Convention have abruptly ended their working relationship with a senior adviser who was listed as a proposed member of the team that would have overseen a now-defunct proposal to raise the issue of President Obama's former spiritual adviser, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., in an advertising campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The adviser, Rebecca Donatelli, was listed as a member of what was called Your Recommended Team of Pirates' in a proposal for the campaign that was submitted this month to Joe Ricketts, the billionaire founder of Ameritrade who was seeking to run super PAC advertisements aimed at blocking President Obama's re-election. The 54-page proposal for the campaign was obtained by The New York Times last week, prompting an announcement from Mr. Ricketts's aides that he had rejected the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the name of Ms. Donatelli's firm, the convention committee said in a statement late Monday, &quot;Campaign Solutions was retained to help develop our convention Web site and digital strategy, but they are no longer involved in convention planning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Donatelli is a widely respected Web strategist who is credited with taking a leading role in the pioneering Internet fund-raising strategy of Senator John McCain during his 2000 presidential campaign, widely considered the first of its kind, and was also the chief Internet strategist for Mr. McCain's 2008 campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was a leading Internet fund-raising strategist for the 2004 and 2008 conventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the proposal became public Ms. Donatelli - who had no comment Monday night - denounced it, referring to Mr. McCain's own rejection of a similar, proposed campaign in 2008 in a statement that read, &quot;Anyone who knows me knows that John McCain is my political North Star and I would never participate in anything that denigrated my political hero or in any way distracted from or undermined the ultimate success of the Romney for President Campaign.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategic Perceptions, the ad firm that was behind the proposal, said last week that Ms. Donatelli  and other strategists listed as potential members of the team &quot;had nothing to do with&quot; drafting the plan, and would have brought on only after final approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People familiar with the discussions of the proposal said that Ms. Donatelli was a natural strategist to turn to as she had already worked for Mr. Ricketts's anti-deficit group, Ending Spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal Election Commission records show that the convention committee had paid Ms. Donatelli's firm more than $65,000 through March. A spokesman for the committee, James Davis, would not comment beyond the statement that she was &quot;no longer involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Mitt Romney's supporters pumped $11.7 million into his presidential campaign in April, a drop of about $1 million from his fundraising the previous month and less than half of President Obama's haul in April, campaign-finance reports show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donations to a pro-Romney super PAC, meanwhile, dropped dramatically. Restore Our Future raised $4.6 million in April, $4million less than it collected in March when it ran hard-hitting ads in early-voting states to fend off Romney's primary challengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's fundraising total doesn't include money he has started to raise jointly with national and state party committees since becoming his party's presumptive nominee. His campaign said those efforts yielded $40.1 million last month, an amount that put him on near-parity with Obama and the Democratic Party in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's main joint-fundraising committee won't file details on its fundraising and contributors until mid-July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not counting party fundraising, Obama raised $25.7 million in April -- about $10 million less than his March haul. Overall, Romney has raised $100.4 million in his main campaign account since kicking off his presidential campaign last year, compared with Obama's $233.5 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP-aligned outside groups, however, may help close the gap. Crossroads GPS, a  group affiliated with Republican strategist Karl Rove, has matched the $25 million Obama's campaign is spending on television commercials this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its dip in fundraising, the pro-Romney Restore Our Future super PAC ended the month with more than $8.2 million in cash reserves to help Romney in the general-election battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Super PACs can raise and spend unlimited money from corporations, unions and corporations as along as they don't coordinate their activity with candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The single-largest donor to Restore Our Future in April: Texas investment manager John Kleinheinz,  who gave $1 million. Harold Hamm, the CEO of Oklahoma-based petroleum producer Continental Resources Inc., gave $985,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Texas home builder Bob Perry gave $750,000. In all, the veteran Republican fundraiser has donated nearly $3.8 million to the super PAC this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fundraising has slowed for other politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who has stopped actively campaigning, raised $2 million in April. He ended the month with $2.5 million in leftover cash.  Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who ended his campaign May 2, reported nearly $4.8 million in debt, including a $1 million owed to a private jet company. Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum had nearly $2.3million in unpaid bills. <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Rick Santorum ended his presidential campaign with $2.3 million in debt while Newt Gingrich owed $4.8 million, new federal filings show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santorum bowed out in early April, owing $763,000 to top adviser John Brabender's firm for television commercials and $640,000 to Arlington technology company Emotive LLC. His campaign had $1 million in the bank at the end of April, meaning he'll need to raise an additional $1.3 million to settle his accounts, according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission made Sunday night.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former candidates often turn to the winner of the party's nomination for help with retiring debt, assistance that former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty has received from presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Romney and Santorum met in Pittsburgh in early May to discuss a possible endorsement.          In April, Romney raised $11.4 million for his campaign and a total of $40.1 million,  including money brought in by the Republican National Committee. That's only slightly less than the $43.6 million raised by President Obama and the Democratic National Committee, which is spending on behalf of the president.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and the DNC had a big cash-on-hand advantage, however. Democrats had $147.2 million in the bank for the race, compared with $61.4 million for Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several new donors made big contributions to a super PAC backing Romney, including $1 million each from John Kleinheinz, a Texas hedge-fund founder, and Harold Hamm, chairman and chief executive of the oil and gas exploration company Continental Resources.Hallador Energy of Colorado, a Nasdaq-listed coal-mining and oil company, gave $100,000 to the Restore Our Future PAC, which raised $4.6 million in April and had $8.2 million in the bank. Hallador's chief executive, Victor Stabio, is a Romney donor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priorities USA Action, the main super PAC behind Obama, raised $1.6 million in April, with almost all of that coming from two unions. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association gave $1 million, and the United Association, representing plumbers and other trades, gave $250,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama PAC has not been able to attract many people willing to donate large sums. Joe Kiani, the founder of medical-device maker Masimo, is the individual donor who gave the most, $100,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Crossroads, a Republican super PAC created with support from George W. Bush administration political adviser Karl Rove, raised $1.8 million in April. Most of the money came from a single $1 million contribution from Texas billionaire Harold Simmons, who, along with Contran Corp., which he owns, has donated $13 million to Crossroads in the 2012 election cycle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign spent $14.3 million in April, including $2.4 million on Internet advertising and $1.8 million on media buys. Romney spent $12.5 million during the same month, with $2 million in media and $2.5 million on direct mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign payroll was $3.7 million, compared with $645,000 for Romney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">720 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this election, we're not having an argument that pits capitalism against socialism. We are trying to decide what kind of capitalism we want. It is a debate as American as Alexander Hamilton, Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay - which is to say that we have always done this. In light of the rise of inequality and the financial mess we just went through, it's a discussion we very much need to have now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The back-and-forth about Bain Capital, Mitt Romney's old company, is part of something larger. So is the inquest into the implications of multibillion-dollar trading losses at JPMorgan Chase. Capitalism can produce wonders. It is also capable of self-destruction, and it can leave a lot of wounded people behind. The trick is to get the most out of what capitalism does well, while containing or preventing the problems it can cause.          To describe this grand debate is not to deny that President Obama's campaign has some, shall we say, narrower motives in going after Bain. Obama's lieutenants need to undermine Romney's claim that his experience in the private equity business makes him just the guy to get our economy back on track.            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bain conversation has already been instructive. Romney's friends no less than his foes have had to face the fact that Bain's purpose was never about job-creation. Its goal was to generate large returns to Bain's partners and investors. It did that, which is why Romney is rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney wants to focus on the positive side of his business dealings that did create jobs. He wants to brag about the companies Bain helped bring to life, among them Staples, Sports Authority and Domino's. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's fair enough. But having made an issue of Bain on the plus side, he also has to answer for the pain and suffering - or, as defenders of capitalism like to call it, the &quot;creative destruction&quot; - that some of Bain's deals left in their wake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This leads naturally to the question of how creative the destruction wrought by our current brand of capitalism actually is. Since the dawn of the leveraged buyout era three decades ago, many friends of capitalism have questioned whether loading companies with debt as part of these deals is good for companies and for the economy as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this approach cause unnecessary suffering among the employees of the companies in question and the communities that often lose plants and jobs as a result? Sucking pension and health funds dry to aggrandize investors seems less like a creative act than a betrayal of workers who made bargains with their employers in good faith. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More generally, while some of the innovations in the financial sphere have been beneficial to growth, it's far from clear that this is true of all or even most of them. Some of them helped cause the downturn we are still trying to escape and created incentives for the dangerous risk-taking that led to JPMorgan's troubles. And there's little doubt that our new financial system has transferred wealth from other sectors of the economy to the people at the top of the financial business. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President Biden's speech last week in Youngstown, Ohio, drew wide attention for its criticism of Romney as someone who just doesn't &quot;get it.&quot; But when Biden moved beyond Romney, he offered an energetic broadside against the new world of finance, and he picked the right venue to make his case: a noble blue-collar town that has been battered by the winds of globalization and economic change.          &quot;You know the difference between having an economy that makes things that the rest of the world wants, and having an economy that is based on financialization of every product,&quot; Biden told his listeners. &quot;You know the difference between an economy . . . that's built on making things rather than on collateralized debt, creative credit-default swaps, financial instruments like subprime mortgages. That's not how you build an economy.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, by contrast, is wary of dismantling any of these nifty new Wall Street inventions, one reason why he wants to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reforms. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to have this great national argument. To borrow a term pioneered by Germany's Christian Democrats, we can try to build a social market. Or we can have an anti-social market. An election is the right venue for deciding which it will be. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Former president Bill Clinton to House Speaker John Boehner,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> according to Washingtonian magazine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                    BY THE NUMBERS          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">50 percent Mitt Romney's likability in the latest Gallup polling. While that's still slow for a presumptive nominee, it's a personal high for Romney and only two points behind President Obama. Romney still faces a significant likability gap in swing states, but with the primary over he appears to be making progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">0 The number of candidates who got enough online votes to win a nominating search run by Americans Elect, a group committed to finding a third-party candidate through a democratic Web system. It's more evidence that as much as people complain about the two parties, a third option is still a distant fantasy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">$25 million The size of a new month-long ad buy from the outside group Crossroads GPS. It's an anti-Obama offensive meant to counter the president's own $25 million ad buy. Even as Romney catches up in fundraising, the move shows that outside spending is already helping him level the playing field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          BEST THING THATHAPPENED TO REPUBLICANS          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They just about evened the financial score in the presidential race. Mitt Romney's status as the clear presumptive GOP nominee allowed him to start raising money for the general election from his primary donors and raise money for the Republican National Committee (which has higher contribution limits than his campaign). The result: Romney raised $40 million in April and was only slightly outraised by President Obama, who pulled in $43.6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          BEST THING THATHAPPENED TO DEMOCRATS          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP establishment fell in a Senate primary again. Never mind the fact that Republicans might actually be better off with state Sen. Deb Fischer as their Senate nominee in Nebraska; her surprise primary win was just the latest example of GOP establishment candidates failing. In about half of major GOP Senate primaries over the past two years, the establishment candidate has been pushed aside or has lost - often at the hands of a tea-party-backed challenger. Republicans better hope that lesser-known candidates such as Fischer and Indiana state Treasurer Richard Mourdock have what it takes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Cory Booker of Newark, a close ally of President Obama in the upcoming election, slammed the president's campaign Sunday for ads attacking Mitt Romney's work for the private-equity firm Bain Capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker, who noted that many of his constituents are investors in or employees of New York-based financial firms, said it was wrong for the Obama campaign to portray the expected Republican nominee as someone who pursued profits by slashing jobs while serving as Bain's chief executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at the totality of Bain Capital's record, they've done a lot to support businesses, to grow businesses,&quot; Booker said during an appearance on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; &quot;And this, to me, I'm very uncomfortable with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor later released a YouTube video in which he tried to clarify his comments and emphasize his support for the president.Booker's remarks earlier Sunday were aimed at a television advertisement introduced by the Obama campaign last week that sharply criticized Romney's record at Bain - a line of attack seen as central in an election whose outcome is expected to be shaped by voters' economic concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertisement intersperses somber interviews with former steelworkers at a plant once owned by Bain and upbeat footage of Romney on the campaign trail. One of the workers calls Romney a &quot;job destroyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker's criticism of the advertisement could help Romney's campaign as it seeks to fend off attacks related to his record at a firm that held investments in a variety of industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to just say, from a very personal level, I'm not about to sit here and indict private equity,&quot; Booker said. &quot;I live in a state where pension funds, unions and other people are investing in companies like Bain Capital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Booker also took aim at reports that Romney supporters had planned to make advertisements reviving Obama's connection to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, a controversial minister in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This kind of stuff is nauseating to me on both sides,&quot; Booker said. &quot;It's nauseating to the American public. Enough is enough. Stop attacking private equity. Stop attacking Jeremiah Wright.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney criticized the Wright ad before it was introduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker's criticism of the Obama&nbsp;ad may deliver a particular sting because of his close ties to Obama and prominent role in the campaign.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this election, we're not having an argument that pits capitalism against socialism. We are trying to decide what kind of capitalism we want. It is a debate as American as Alexander Hamilton, Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay - which is to say that we have always done this. In light of the rise of inequality and the financial mess we just went through, it's a discussion we very much need to have now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The back-and-forth about Bain Capital, Mitt Romney's old company, is part of something larger. So is the inquest into the implications of multibillion-dollar trading losses at JPMorgan Chase. Capitalism can produce wonders. It is also capable of self-destruction, and it can leave a lot of wounded people behind. The trick is to get the most out of what capitalism does well, while containing or preventing the problems it can cause. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To describe this grand debate is not to deny that President Obama's campaign has some, shall we say, narrower motives in going after Bain. Obama's lieutenants need to undermine Romney's claim that his experience in the private equity business makes him just the guy to get our economy back on track. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bain conversation has already been instructive. Romney's friends no less than his foes have had to face the fact that Bain's purpose was never about job-creation. Its goal was to generate large returns to Bain's partners and investors. It did that, which is why Romney is rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney wants to focus on the positive side of his business dealings that did create jobs. He wants to brag about the companies Bain helped bring to life, among them Staples, Sports Authority and Domino's. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's fair enough. But having made an issue of Bain on the plus side, he also has to answer for the pain and suffering - or, as defenders of capitalism like to call it, the &quot;creative destruction&quot; - that some of Bain's deals left in their wake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This leads naturally to the question of how creative the destruction wrought by our current brand of capitalism actually is. Since the dawn of the leveraged buyout era three decades ago, many friends of capitalism have questioned whether loading companies with debt as part of these deals is good for companies and for the economy as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this approach cause unnecessary suffering among the employees of the companies in question and the communities that often lose plants and jobs as a result? Sucking pension and health funds dry to aggrandize investors seems less like a creative act than a betrayal of workers who made bargains with their employers in good faith. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More generally, while some of the innovations in the financial sphere have been beneficial to growth, it's far from clear that this is true of all or even most of them. Some of them helped cause the downturn we are still trying to escape and created incentives for the dangerous risk-taking that led to JPMorgan's troubles. And there's little doubt that our new financial system has transferred wealth from other sectors of the economy to the people at the top of the financial business. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President Biden's speech last week in Youngstown, Ohio, drew wide attention for its criticism of Romney as someone who just doesn't &quot;get it.&quot; But when Biden moved beyond Romney, he offered an energetic broadside against the new world of finance, and he picked the right venue to make his case: a noble blue-collar town that has been battered by the winds of globalization and economic change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the difference between having an economy that makes things that the rest of the world wants, and having an economy that is based on financialization of every product,&quot; Biden told his listeners. &quot;You know the difference between an economy . . . that's built on making things rather than on collateralized debt, creative credit-default swaps, financial instruments like subprime mortgages. That's not how you build an economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, by contrast, is wary of dismantling any of these nifty new Wall Street inventions, one reason why he wants to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reforms. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to have this great national argument. To borrow a term pioneered by Germany's Christian Democrats, we can try to build a social market. Or we can have an anti-social market. An election is the right venue for deciding which it will be. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former president Bill Clinton to House Speaker John Boehner, according to Washingtonian magazine.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">BY THE NUMBERS</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">50 percent Mitt Romney's likability in the latest Gallup polling. While that's still slow for a presumptive nominee, it's a personal high for Romney and only two points behind President Obama. Romney still faces a significant likability gap in swing states, but with the primary over he appears to be making progress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">0 The number of candidates who got enough online votes to win a nominating search run by Americans Elect, a group committed to finding a third-party candidate through a democratic Web system. It's more evidence that as much as people complain about the two parties, a third option is still a distant fantasy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">$25 million The size of a new month-long ad buy from the outside group Crossroads GPS. It's an anti-Obama offensive meant to counter the president's own $25 million ad buy. Even as Romney catches up in fundraising, the move shows that outside spending is already helping him level the playing field.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">BEST THING THATHAPPENED TO REPUBLICANS</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They just about evened the financial score in the presidential race. Mitt Romney's status as the clear presumptive GOP nominee allowed him to start raising money for the general election from his primary donors and raise money for the Republican National Committee (which has higher contribution limits than his campaign). The result: Romney raised $40 million in April and was only slightly outraised by President Obama, who pulled in $43.6 million.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">BEST THING THATHAPPENED TO DEMOCRATS</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP establishment fell in a Senate primary again. Never mind the fact that Republicans might actually be better off with state Sen. Deb Fischer as their Senate nominee in Nebraska; her surprise primary win was just the latest example of GOP establishment candidates failing. In about half of major GOP Senate primaries over the past two years, the establishment candidate has been pushed aside or has lost - often at the hands of a tea-party-backed challenger. Republicans better hope that lesser-known candidates such as Fischer and Indiana state Treasurer Richard Mourdock have what it takes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Cory Booker of Newark, a close ally of President Obama in the upcoming election, slammed the president's campaign Sunday for ads attacking Mitt Romney's work for the private-equity firm Bain Capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker, who noted that many of his constituents are investors in or employees of New York-based financial firms, said it was wrong for the Obama campaign to portray the expected Republican nominee as someone who pursued profits by slashing jobs while serving as Bain's chief executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at the totality of Bain Capital's record, they've done a lot to support businesses, to grow businesses,&quot; Booker said during an appearance on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; &quot;And this, to me, I'm very uncomfortable with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor later released a YouTube videoin which he tried to clarify his comments and emphasize his support for the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker's remarks earlier Sunday were aimed at a television advertisementintroduced by the Obama campaign last week that sharply criticized Romney's record at Bain - a line of attack seen as central in an election whose outcome is expected to be shaped by voters' economic concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertisement intersperses somber interviews with former steelworkers at a plant once owned by Bain and upbeat footage of Romney on the campaign trail. One of the workers calls Romney a &quot;job destroyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker's criticism of the advertisement could help Romney's campaign as it seeks to fend off attacks related to his record at a firm that held investments in a variety of industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to just say, from a very personal level, I'm not about to sit here and indict private equity,&quot; Booker said. &quot;I live in a state where pension funds, unions and other people are investing in companies like Bain Capital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Booker also took aim at reports that Romney supporters had planned to make advertisements reviving Obama's connection to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, a controversial minister in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This kind of stuff is nauseating to me on both sides,&quot; Booker said. &quot;It's nauseating to the American public. Enough is enough. Stop attacking private equity. Stop attacking Jeremiah Wright.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney criticized the Wright ad before it was introduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker's criticism of the Obama&nbsp;ad may deliver a particular sting because of his close ties to Obama and prominent role in the campaign.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOW we know what, in today's warped political economy, $10 million buys you: a hit job spectacular not only in its cynicism but also in its idiocy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg reported last week in The Times, a politically agitated billionaire (these days, there don't seem to be any other kind) was considering forking over that much for an advertising campaign that would have dusted off the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and tried to fashion him anew into a noose for Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while such a campaign would have been eaten up by many established Obama opponents already bloated with hostility toward him, it would have nauseated most swing voters, who are poised to decide the presidential contest of 2012. Beyond which, these voters have had three and a half years of Obama's actual presidency, as opposed to his bright promises and others' dark prophecies, to decide whether he's a closet black radical, as the advertising campaign would have insinuated, or a ''metrosexual, black Abe Lincoln,'' which is how it would have described his self-presentation in 2008. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A moment's pause and a measure of sorely needed levity are in order, to contemplate what a metrosexual Abe Lincoln might look like. Tidier beard, for sure. Better manscaping all in all. Maybe some mole removal. Lose the top hat. Less Potomac, more Provincetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But back to business: these Wright ads, now shelved forevermore, would more likely have buoyed than torpedoed the president, because swing voters -- who swung for Obama once already -- don't want to be told that they were duped in 2008. They still have some emotional investment in his narrative, and in many cases maintain affection and respect for the man himself. That's why his re-election prospects and approval ratings aren't as bad as they might be, given our prolonged economic doldrums and the unpopularity of health care reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he's a cooler, more charismatic cat than Mitt Romney, whose wisest supporters know that a contest stressing jobs is better for their candidate than a contest stressing personality and emotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Ricketts, the billionaire who contemplated a wrongful use of Wright, apparently didn't get that memo. Perhaps he was distracted by the baseball team his family owns, the Chicago Cubs, or his bison, herds of which he keeps in Wyoming. Rich people collect the darnedest things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case he went rogue, like a missile or a Palin, and in doing so illustrated two disturbing, corrosive dynamics in our political culture right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is the seemingly metastasizing ranks of magnates with itchy millions and the desire to single-handedly bankroll certain candidates or initiatives. They're exemplified by Sheldon Adelson, who saw no better use for his wealth than stringing out Newt &amp; Callista's Execrable Adventure long past the point of box-office viability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they're emboldened, perhaps, by a freewheeling climate around campaign spending right now. In the wake of Citizens United, super PACs could turn out to be the new Gulfstream jets. No tycoon is complete without one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's fascinating how things have evolved and spun out of control. In the quaint old days of Lee Atwater and his disciples, a candidate's team nudged outside players to do dirty work that it didn't want its own fingerprints on. The Ricketts saga raises the specter of outside players actually volunteering for even dirtier work that a candidate's team has no desire for and can't wrestle control of. The Swift Boat has a motor and mind of its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what nasty waves it makes. That's the second issue here. A memo prepared for Ricketts expressed frustration that voters ''still aren't ready to hate this president.'' Note the word choice in that thought and the goal telegraphed by it. Voters aren't to be persuaded that Obama lacks the proper skills and plan. They're to be pumped full of unalloyed disdain for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THAT'S how too many campaigns and legislative battles are waged these days: with bile instead of reason, catcalls in place of conversation, and the basest of instincts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your opponent isn't just ill informed. He or she is an idiot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your opponent isn't just wrongheaded. He or she is evil incarnate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Mitt Romney's leadership, Bain Capital didn't just close a Kansas City steel mill. ''Like a vampire,'' it ''sucked the life'' from the enterprise and those involved in it, according to a former worker whom the Obama campaign chose to showcase in a TV ad it ran on Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a take-no-prisoners approach that does take prisoners: all of us, incarcerated in a system whose crippling partisanship is fueled in part by the hyperbolic language, bellicose tactics and Manichaean tone of candidates and their handlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while there was slander aplenty in our politics past, it wasn't amplified quite as loudly or spread quite as ferociously as it is by the fight club of today's hyped-up news outlets, many of which run on the adrenaline of insults and recruit partisan voices to beckon partisan audiences. Turning to Fox News or the Daily Caller, unshakable conservatives can marinate in their contempt for liberals. Turning to MSNBC or the Daily Kos, unshakable liberals can repay the favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the swing voters are turned off. Many of them recoil from meanness run amok and cynicism on steroids, which is why Ricketts's redeployment of Wright would have been such folly. They want someone to make them feel calmer and more confident, not anxious and gross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worth noting: Rob Portman, the Ohio senator mentioned frequently these days as a front-runner for the Republican vice-presidential nomination, won his 2010 race, in a state whose other senator is a Democrat, by 18 points. Yes, it was an excellent year for Republicans, but not quite that excellent for all of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't do it with runaway charisma (though a financial advantage certainly helped). He did it in his steady, subdued manner. In fact the rap on him as a potential running mate for Romney is that he's too boring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe so. But there are clearly voters out there who are interested in turning down the heat on our political discourse. Flamethrowers like Ricketts are the last thing they want. And the last thing we need.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN I listen to President Obama speak to and about women, he sometimes sounds too paternalistic for my taste. In numerous appearances over the years -- most recently at the Barnard graduation -- he has made reference to how women are smarter than men. It's all so tired, the kind of fake praise showered upon those one views as easy to impress. As I listen, I am always bracing for the old go-to cliche: ''Behind every great man is a great woman.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some women are smarter than men and some aren't. But to suggest to women that they deserve dominance instead of equality is at best a cheap applause line. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My bigger concern is that in courting women, Mr. Obama's campaign so far has seemed maddeningly off point. His message to the Barnard graduates was that they should fight for a ''seat at the table'' -- the head seat, he made sure to add. He conceded that it's a tough economy, but he told the grads, ''I am convinced you are tougher'' and ''things will get better -- they always do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardly reassuring words when you look at the reality. According to the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, about 53.6 percent of men and women under the age of 25 who hold bachelor's degrees were jobless or underemployed last year, the most in at least 11 years. According to the Pew Research Center, if we broaden the age group to 18- to 29-year-olds, an estimated 37 percent are unemployed or out of the work force, the highest share in more than three decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human faces shouldn't get lost amid the statistics. I spent last weekend with a friend who attended excellent private schools and graduated from Tufts University two years ago. She's intelligent, impressive and still looking for a full-time job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women I know who are struggling in this economy couldn't be further from the fictional character of Julia, presented in Mr. Obama's Web ad, ''The Life of Julia,'' a silly and embarrassing caricature based on the assumption that women look to government at every meaningful phase of their lives for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My cousin in Louisiana started a small company with a little savings, renovating houses. A single mom, she saved enough to buy a home and provide child care for her son. When the economy went belly up, so did her company. She was forced to sell her home and move in with her parents. She has found another job, but doesn't make enough to move out. Family, not government, has been everything to her at this time of crisis. She, and they, wouldn't have it any other way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another member of my family left her job at an adoption agency just before the economy crashed. Also a single mother, she has been looking for a way back to a full-time job ever since. She has been selling things on eBay to make ends meet. Friends and family, not government, have been there at the dire moments when she has asked them to be. Again, she, and they, wouldn't have it any other way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to say that government doesn't play a role in their lives. It does and it should. But it isn't a dominant one, and certainly not an overwhelming factor in their daily existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's obvious why the president is doing a full-court press for the vote of college-educated women in particular. The Republican primaries probably did turn some women away. Rick Santorum did his party no favors when he spoke about women in combat (''I think that can be a very compromising situation, where people naturally may do things that may not be in the interest of the mission, because of other types of emotions that are involved''); when he described the birth of a child from rape as ''a gift in a very broken way''; and how, if he was president, he would make the case for the damage caused by contraception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mitt Romney will never be confused with Rick Santorum on these issues, and many women understand that. (I should disclose here that my husband is an adviser to Mr. Romney; I have no involvement with any campaign, and have been an independent journalist throughout my career.) The struggling women in my life all laughed when I asked them if contraception or abortion rights would be a major factor in their decision about this election. For them, and for most other women, the economy overwhelms everything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another recent Pew Research Center survey found that voters, when thinking about whom to vote for in the fall, are most concerned about the economy (86 percent) and jobs (84 percent). Near the bottom of the list were some of the hot-button social issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tiffany Dufu, who heads the White House Project, a nonpartisan group aimed at training young women for careers in politics and business, got a similar response when she informally polled young women in her organization. ''The issues that have been defined as all women care about are way off -- young women feel it has put them further in a box they don't necessarily want to be in,'' she told me. ''Independence is what is so important to these women.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have always admired President Obama and I agree with him on some issues, like abortion rights. But the promise of his campaign four years ago has given way to something else -- a failure to connect with tens of millions of Americans, many of them women, who feel economic opportunity is gone and are losing hope. In an effort to win them back, Mr. Obama is trying too hard. He's employing a tone that can come across as grating and even condescending. He really ought to drop it. Most women don't want to be patted on the head or treated as wards of the state. They simply want to be given a chance to succeed based on their talent and skills. To borrow a phrase from our president's favorite president, Abraham Lincoln, they want ''an open field and a fair chance.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second decade of the 21st century, that isn't asking too much.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6:51 p.m. | Updated  Mayor Cory Booker of Newark, a prominent Democrat enlisted as a surrogate for President Obama's campaign, sharply criticized the campaign on Sunday for attacking Mitt Romney's work in the private equity firm Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Booker,speaking on the&nbsp;NBC program &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; made his comments in response to a new television advertisement that the president's campaign unveiled last week portraying Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, as someone who eliminated jobs for the sake of profits during his years running Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to just say from a very personal level I'm not about to sit here and indict private equity,&quot; Mr. Booker said. &quot;To me it's just we're getting to a ridiculous point in America, especially that I know I live in a state where pension funds, unions and other people are investing in companies like Bain Capital. If you look at the totality of Bain Capital's record they've done a lot to support businesses, to grow businesses. And this to me, I'm very uncomfortable with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last point I'll make is this kind of stuff is nauseating to me on both sides,'' he continued. &quot;It's nauseating to the American public. Enough is enough. Stop attacking private equity. Stop attacking Jeremiah Wright.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In mentioning Mr. Wright, Mr. Obama's former pastor, Mr. Booker seemed to be referring to a report last week in The New York Times that Joe Ricketts, a billionaire who founded the brokerage firm TD Ameritrade, was considering a plan to finance a $10 million advertising campaign tying Mr. Obama&nbsp;to the controversial and racially tinged comments of Mr. Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. Ricketts' plan was disclosed, it drew sharp criticism not just from Democrats and the Obama campaign but also from Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This stuff has got to stop, because what it does is it undermines, to me, what this country should be focused on,&quot; Mr. Booker said on &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; &quot;It's a distraction from the real issues. It's either going to be a small campaign about this crap or it's going to be a big campaign, in my opinion, about the issues that the American public cares about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Booker's comments immediately provoked widespread interest among political types on social media, in large part because he seemed to be equating the Obama campaign with Mr. Ricketts, who after The Times report announced that he was rejecting the ad campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign declined to comment, directing reporters instead to Mr. Booker's Twitter account, in which the Newark mayor told angry followers that he would &quot;clarify&quot; the comments he made on television. &quot;This is what I so dislike about politics,&quot; he wrote on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will fight hard for Obama to win. But just as his 08 campaign did, I believe we must elevate &amp; not denigrate. This is the Obama I know</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Cory Booker (@CoryBooker)20 May 12</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we as &quot;the electorate&quot; must also bear responsibility for changing the tone of politics as usual. Not just root harder for our side</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Cory Booker (@CoryBooker)20 May 12</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes I'm sick to my stomach of the politics of destruction. We now have a fed gov that can't come together &amp; solve our nation's problems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Cory Booker (@CoryBooker)20 May 12</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll always prioritize my nation over a political party. &amp; right now crass divisive partisan politics is not serving the citizens of my city</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Cory Booker (@CoryBooker)20 May 12</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I'll clarify my comments on MTP. Yes, Obama must be re-elected. But we as a Nation owe it to him &amp; ourselves 2 reject politics as usual</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a difference four years make. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Barack Obama was running for president, he successfully managed to distance himself from the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, leaving his Chicago church during the campaign and shrugging off suggestions that the preacher's fiery rhetoric had any effect on him over the 20 years of their close friendship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How close? Wright inspired the title of Obama's book &quot;The Audacity of Hope.&quot; He conducted the Obamas' wedding ceremony and baptized the Obama girls. He led the family in prayer on the day Obama announced his candidacy for president.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years later, the mere mention of Wright by political opponents is considered racist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just ask Republican political strategist Fred Davis. Or his once-potential client, billionaire Joe Ricketts. Davis prepared a proposal for an ad campaign for Ricketts's consideration titled &quot;The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good&quot; - and all hell broke loose.          The proposal, which highlights the Obama-Wright relationship and resembles an ad rejected the last go-round by the McCain campaign, has made tsunami waves, thanks to a story on the New York Times' front page. Who leaked the 54-page proposal may be the most interesting aspect of this story, but we may die without knowing. Or we can watch closely the career paths of various actors in the next several months.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intent of the ads was to shine a light on how Obama's character was formed and why he should not be reelected. They were not a good idea, obviously, but they also were never ads. They were a proposal born of a sense among Republicans that Obama's relationship to Wright was never sufficiently vetted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of Obama's character pertains to his denial of the degree of that relationship, not that he found a father figure in Wright when he was still in his 20s. Nevertheless, to question Obama's character based on his association with Wright at this point seems too much too late. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has a record as president and can be challenged on that record. Raising Wright now would have been a serious miscalculation and would have been interpreted as attempting to inspire racial animus. But it is unfair to smear Davis as a racist, as some have suggested. He obviously created a proposal based on his sense that this would appeal to Ricketts, who said upon viewing the rejected McCain ad: &quot;If the nation had seen that ad, they'd never have elected Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis, whose creativity is widely acknowledged, was obviously aware of the possible racial sensitivity, which is why he also hoped to include prominent African Americans, such as radio host Larry Elder, questioning Obama's character. Whites cannot do this without suffering the consequences now in play. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a strategist's perspective, Wright is nearly irresistible. Colorful and outrageous, his views are the stuff of political operatives' dreams. As he confirmed for an audience at the National Press Club in 2008, Wright believes, among many other headline writers' delights, that the government created AIDS as a means of genocide, that U.S. Marines are like Roman legionnaires and that the terrorist attacks of 9/11 were merely chickens coming home to roost. If you're a Fred Davis, ignoring such statements and the influential relationship of its speaker to the president of the United States would be like ignoring unemployed Americans who long ago lost their jobs when Bain Capital rode into town. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaking of the document and the prominent display of the story have been a boon to Obama. They provided yet another welcome distraction, as well as a helpful fundraising tool, and smeared Romney by association. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The power (and hubris) of individual political donors and their offspring - the ads they want to sire - may become the tragedy of this election season. Romney is nothing like a racist, yet suddenly he is forced to distance himself from ads about which he knew nothing. And we now can agree that resurrecting Wright for any purpose would do more political harm than good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ricketts apparently would agree. He has distanced himself from the proposal faster than Obama distanced himself from Wright. And poor Romney had to repudiate an ad campaign that never was, that probably never would have been, and over which he had zero control.           And thus ends another faux controversy about non-ads in the very strange universe known as American Politics.           </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">&quot;We were able to help create over 100,000 jobs. On the president's watch, about 100,000 jobs were lost in the auto industry and auto dealers and auto manufacturers, so he's hardly one to point a finger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">- Mitt Romney,_blank interviewon Hot Air, May 16, 2012</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 100,000 jobs is back! The presumptive GOP nominee all but stopped mentioning he created 100,000 jobs in the private sector after _blankwe declared in January that claim was untenable and unproven. The biggest problem is that Romney is counting all the jobs added by companies long after he had left the leadership of Bain Capital - and even after Bain's investment in the companies had ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Hot Air interview, Romney even made this claim while at the same time arguing that _blanka recent Obama campaign commercial slamming the job losses at a particular Bain investment was unfair because &quot;the steel factory closed down two years after I left Bain Capital. I was no longer there, so that's hardly something which is on my watch.&quot; (Technically, Romney _blankhad not completely extricated himself from Bain, but that's another story.)           The logic there escapes us. Romney appears to be saying it is okay to count jobs created after he left Bain, but it's not okay to count jobs lost after he left Bain.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As we have said, Romney &quot;certainly has a good story to tell about knowing how to manage a business, spotting opportunities and understanding high finance.&quot; But if he wants to wall off companies that failed after he stopped managing Bain, he also has to stop counting jobs created after he left Bain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So Romney gets a &quot;repeat offender&quot; award for once again saying he created 100,000 jobs. But let's also look at his claim that 100,000 jobs were lost in the auto industry &quot;on the president's watch.&quot; That's a new one. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Romney campaign often cites _blankBureau of Labor Statistics to make its case that the number of overall jobs has declined in Obama's presidency, so that's the first place we looked. The BLS data show that much of the decline in auto industry employment took place in 2008, before Obama became president. Just in 2008, some 254,000 jobs disappeared in vehicle and vehicle parts manufacturing and 211,000 at vehicle dealerships. The numbers are equally grim if you just look at auto manufacturing and dealerships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But since January 2009, when Obama took office, overall there has been an increase in jobs. The number of jobs hit a low point in November 2009, but then it has slowly inched upward so that Obama can point to the auto industry and say there has been a net gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In vehicle and vehicle parts manufacturing, the total number of jobs has increased by 73,000. For dealers, the gain has been nearly 30,000. So, all told, that's more than 100,000 - instead of a decrease of 100,000, as Romney claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a little more difficult to isolate the automobile-only numbers because the manufacturing number is not seasonally adjusted. So, in that case, we have to use January-to-January figures. But that also shows a total gain of about 50,000 jobs in the auto industry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We presented these figures to the Romney campaign and asked how the former Massachusetts governor calculated the 100,000-loss figure. We were first directed to _blankan article that appeared in the Washington Examiner on Thursday - after Romney gave his interview. The article calculated that 112,150 workers at General Motors and Chrysler dealerships lost their jobs as part of the painful restructuring imposed on those companies in exchange for getting additional bailout money. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">           In any case, Romney's statement- &quot;On the president's watch, about 100,000 jobs were lost in the auto industry &quot;- certainly does not suggest he is only focusing on the job cuts at the dealerships of two auto companies for just a period of months. But the Romney campaign said he was not talking about the entire auto industry.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we are well within our rights to say that 'on the president's watch' refers to when the Obama administration was in control of them,&quot; said Eric Fehrnstrom, senior adviser to Romney. &quot;The point we are making is that just like in private equity, layoffs can occur when restructuring troubled firms. We are not referring to the entire auto industry, foreign and domestic, during Obama's presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fehrnstrom pointed to some numbers to substantiate the 100,000 figure. For instance, GM lost 45,000 jobs from _blankDec. 31, 2008, to _blankDec. 31, 2011, according to filings at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He also cited the dealership cuts.These are useful statistics, but we have trouble getting past the BLS data, especially when on other occasions, Romney has used &quot;watch&quot; to refer to the entire Obama presidency. Here is one recent example, from just last month: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">&quot;Under this president's watch, more Americans have lost their jobs than during any other period since the Depression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we really believe we have to evaluate his statement against the record of Obama's presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          The Pinocchio Test          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Romney's remarks make little sense. Not only is his claim of creating 100,000 jobs at Bain untenable, but also his assertion that 100,000 jobs have been lost in the auto industry &quot;on the president's watch&quot; does not add up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yes, there were some painful cuts in the auto industry at the start of Obama's presidency, largely because tough choices had to be made. One could argue whether those choices were necessary or effective, but the bottom line is clear: No matter how you slice it, jobs overall have grown substantially in the auto industry under Obama.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a difference four years make. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Barack Obama was running for president, he successfully managed to distance himself from the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, leaving his Chicago church during the campaign and shrugging off suggestions that the preacher's fiery rhetoric had any effect on him over the 20 years of their close friendship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How close? Wright inspired the title of Obama's book &quot;The Audacity of Hope.&quot; He conducted the Obamas' wedding ceremony and baptized the Obama girls. He led the family in prayer on the day Obama announced his candidacy for president.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years later, the mere mention of Wright by political opponents is considered racist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just ask Republican political strategist Fred Davis. Or his once-potential client, billionaire Joe Ricketts. Davis prepared a proposal for an ad campaign for Ricketts's consideration titled &quot;The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good&quot; - and all hell broke loose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal, which highlights the Obama-Wright relationship and resembles an ad rejected the last go-round by the McCain campaign, has made tsunami waves, thanks to a story on the New York Times' front page. Who leaked the 54-page proposal may be the most interesting aspect of this story, but we may die without knowing. Or we can watch closely the career paths of various actors in the next several months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intent of the ads was to shine a light on how Obama's character was formed and why he should not be reelected. They were not a good idea, obviously, but they also were never ads. They were a proposal born of a sense among Republicans that Obama's relationship to Wright was never sufficiently vetted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of Obama's character pertains to his denial of the degree of that relationship, not that he found a father figure in Wright when he was still in his 20s. Nevertheless, to question Obama's character based on his association with Wright at this point seems too much too late. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has a record as president and can be challenged on that record. Raising Wright now would have been a serious miscalculation and would have been interpreted as attempting to inspire racial animus. But it is unfair to smear Davis as a racist, as some have suggested. He obviously created a proposal based on his sense that this would appeal to Ricketts, who said upon viewing the rejected McCain ad: &quot;If the nation had seen that ad, they'd never have elected Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis, whose creativity is widely acknowledged, was obviously aware of the possible racial sensitivity, which is why he also hoped to include prominent African Americans, such as radio host Larry Elder, questioning Obama's character. Whites cannot do this without suffering the consequences now in play. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a strategist's perspective, Wright is nearly irresistible. Colorful and outrageous, his views are the stuff of political operatives' dreams. As he confirmed for an audience at the National Press Club in 2008, Wright believes, among many other headline writers' delights, that the government created AIDS as a means of genocide, that U.S. Marines are like Roman legionnaires and that the terrorist attacks of 9/11 were merely chickens coming home to roost. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're a Fred Davis, ignoring such statements and the influential relationship of its speaker to the president of the United States would be like ignoring unemployed Americans who long ago lost their jobs when Bain Capital rode into town. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaking of the document and the prominent display of the story have been a boon to Obama. They provided yet another welcome distraction, as well as a helpful fundraising tool, and smeared Romney by association. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The power (and hubris) of individual political donors and their offspring - the ads they want to sire - may become the tragedy of this election season. Romney is nothing like a racist, yet suddenly he is forced to distance himself from ads about which he knew nothing. And we now can agree that resurrecting Wright for any purpose would do more political harm than good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ricketts apparently would agree. He has distanced himself from the proposal faster than Obama distanced himself from Wright. And poor Romney had to repudiate an ad campaign that never was, that probably never would have been, and over which he had zero control. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And thus ends another faux controversy about non-ads in the very strange universe known as American Politics. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were able to help create over 100,000 jobs. On the president's watch, about 100,000 jobs were lost in the auto industry and auto dealers and auto manufacturers, so he's hardly one to point a finger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Mitt Romney,_blank interviewon Hot Air, May 16, 2012 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 100,000 jobs is back! The presumptive GOP nominee all but stopped mentioning he created 100,000 jobs in the private sector after _blankwe declared in January that claim was untenable and unproven. The biggest problem is that Romney is counting all the jobs added by companies long after he had left the leadership of Bain Capital - and even after Bain's investment in the companies had ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Hot Air interview, Romney even made this claim while at the same time arguing that _blanka recent Obama campaign commercial slamming the job losses at a particular Bain investment was unfair because &quot;the steel factory closed down two years after I left Bain Capital. I was no longer there, so that's hardly something which is on my watch.&quot; (Technically, Romney _blankhad not completely extricated himself from Bain, but that's another story.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The logic there escapes us. Romney appears to be saying it is okay to count jobs created after he left Bain, but it's not okay to count jobs lost after he left Bain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As we have said, Romney &quot;certainly has a good story to tell about knowing how to manage a business, spotting opportunities and understanding high finance.&quot; But if he wants to wall off companies that failed after he stopped managing Bain, he also has to stop counting jobs created after he left Bain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So Romney gets a &quot;repeat offender&quot; award for once again saying he created 100,000 jobs. But let's also look at his claim that 100,000 jobs were lost in the auto industry &quot;on the president's watch.&quot; That's a new one. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The Facts</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Romney campaign often cites _blankBureau of Labor Statistics to make its case that the number of overall jobs has declined in Obama's presidency, so that's the first place we looked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BLS data show that much of the decline in auto industry employment took place in 2008, before Obama became president. Just in 2008, some 254,000 jobs disappeared in vehicle and vehicle parts manufacturing and 211,000 at vehicle dealerships. The numbers are equally grim if you just look at auto manufacturing and dealerships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But since January 2009, when Obama took office, overall there has been an increase in jobs. The number of jobs hit a low point in November 2009, but then it has slowly inched upward so that Obama can point to the auto industry and say there has been a net gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In vehicle and vehicle parts manufacturing, the total number of jobs has increased by 73,000. For dealers, the gain has been nearly 30,000. So, all told, that's more than 100,000 - instead of a decrease of 100,000, as Romney claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a little more difficult to isolate the automobile-only numbers because the manufacturing number is not seasonally adjusted. So, in that case, we have to use January-to-January figures. But that also shows a total gain of about 50,000 jobs in the auto industry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We presented these figures to the Romney campaign and asked how the former Massachusetts governor calculated the 100,000-loss figure. We were first directed to _blankan article that appeared in the Washington Examiner on Thursday - after Romney gave his interview. The article calculated that 112,150 workers at General Motors and Chrysler dealerships lost their jobs as part of the painful restructuring imposed on those companies in exchange for getting additional bailout money. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In any case, Romney's statement- &quot;On the president's watch, about 100,000 jobs were lost in the auto industry &quot;- certainly does not suggest he is only focusing on the job cuts at the dealerships of two auto companies for just a period of months. But the Romney campaign said he was not talking about the entire auto industry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we are well within our rights to say that 'on the president's watch' refers to when the Obama administration was in control of them,&quot; said Eric Fehrnstrom, senior adviser to Romney. &quot;The point we are making is that just like in private equity, layoffs can occur when restructuring troubled firms. We are not referring to the entire auto industry, foreign and domestic, during Obama's presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fehrnstrom pointed to some numbers to substantiate the 100,000 figure. For instance, GM lost 45,000 jobs from _blankDec. 31, 2008, to _blankDec. 31, 2011, according to filings at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He also cited the dealership cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are useful statistics, but we have trouble getting past the BLS data, especially when on other occasions, Romney has used &quot;watch&quot; to refer to the entire Obama presidency. Here is one recent example, from just last month: &quot;Under this president's watch, more Americans have lost their jobs than during any other period since the Depression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we really believe we have to evaluate his statement against the record of Obama's presidency.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The Pinocchio Test</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Romney's remarks make little sense. Not only is his claim of creating 100,000 jobs at Bain untenable, but also his assertion that 100,000 jobs have been lost in the auto industry &quot;on the president's watch&quot; does not add up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yes, there were some painful cuts in the auto industry at the start of Obama's presidency, largely because tough choices had to be made. One could argue whether those choices were necessary or effective, but the bottom line is clear: No matter how you slice it, jobs overall have grown substantially in the auto industry under Obama. In fact, it is one of the bright spots of today's economy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Perhaps the uglier side of politics is always close to the surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama and his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, have said for months that the 2012 election will be about the economy. But on Thursday, it became -- at least for a brief moment -- about the always touchy issues of race and religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continuing economic struggles in the country will almost certainly dominate the debate in the next six months. The unemployment rate remains above 8 percent, the housing slump continues, debt is rising rapidly and overseas economies are flailing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the events Thursday suggest that it does not take much to divert the presidential campaign conversation back into the sensitive and politically dangerous questions of Mr. Obama's race, his religion and the place of his birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report in The New York Times on Thursday exposed a secret plan by Republican strategists and financiers to rekindle questions about the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., Mr. Obama's onetime pastor, and his angry black-power sermons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney repudiated the plan to use Mr. Wright's words as a racially tinged cudgel against Mr. Obama. But the report served to once again steer the campaign away from the economy and onto the tricky terrain of racial politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters brought up Mr. Romney's comment in February suggesting that Mr. Obama wanted to make America into ''a less Christian nation.'' Asked if he stood by that comment, Mr. Romney said that he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm not familiar, precisely, with exactly what I said, but I stand by what I said, whatever it was,'' Mr. Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. Obama said that they were not surprised by the day's events and that they remained prepared to respond even more forcefully -- with television ads, if necessary -- if the religion- or race-based attacks return later in the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''To the extent that this ever raises its head, we will certainly be ready with a forceful response,'' said one adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, who requested anonymity to discuss strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign advisers said the American people had largely dismissed the questions about his birth and about links to his former pastor. They pointed to polls that show that the president remains personally likable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The American people know who he is,'' the adviser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the issues of race and religion never go completely away, at least in some extreme quarters of the American electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the Drudge Report posted a link on its Web site to a report that sought to revive the long-discredited assertion that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States. And as election season heats up, so does publication of books promoting various conspiracies and theories, including a new one seeking to focus new attention on Mr. Obama's dealings with Mr. Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign has kept a considerable distance from the anti-Obama fringe. It only turns off moderate and independent voters, while stirring up Mr. Obama's base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. Romney has his own experience with the staying power of personal attacks. During the Republican primary campaign, ugly questions about his Mormon faith were revived by a few conservative pastors who called it a ''cult.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's advisers have rejected the idea of a religion speech like the one he gave in 2007, saying members of the public know Mr. Romney and his personal history in a way they did not back then. But it is interesting to wonder what the campaign might do if a ''super PAC'' raised his religion in an attack ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Mr. Romney sought to go on the offensive by accusing Mr. Obama of conducting a campaign of ''character assassination'' over the past several months. He said Mr. Obama's attacks on his record at Bain Capital were intended to suggest that he was not ''a good person.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in truth, as the final six months of campaigning begin, both the campaigns and the candidates have shied away from the charged issues of race and religion. Both men have powerful incentives to keep the campaign from becoming a nasty dissection of their personal backgrounds. Both want to avoid a focus on what might strike some voters as exotic backgrounds that set them apart from middle-class Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their actions suggest that -- at least for now -- there remains a line that neither side is willing to cross. The question is: will the superrich backers of super PACs play by the same rules?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians, consultants and voters are all bracing for the answer.</SPAN></P>

With the recent $2 billion loss reported by JP Morgan bank, reassessing the nation's financial market has taken greater priority within the administration.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many Republicans, the belief has never died that President Obama is a secret revolutionary nurtured on black liberationist theology. Right-wing Web sites are littered with this nonsense, and the Fox News host Sean Hannity regularly tries to tie Mr. Obama to the clearly racist views of his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. Even Mitt Romney suggested in February, on Mr. Hannity's radio show, that Mr. Obama listened too much to Mr. Wright. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Senator John McCain refused to make this divisive tactic part of his campaign against Mr. Obama. But, in a more coarsened political atmosphere, the rise of unlimited money has made it possible for a wealthy person to broadcast any attack while keeping a distance from it. As Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg reported in The Times on Thursday, Joe Ricketts, the billionaire founder of TD Ameritrade, worked with Republican strategists to prepare a $10 million ad campaign suggesting the president's governing philosophy came directly from Mr. Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the plan was disclosed, Mr. Ricketts said he was not interested in socially divisive tactics and the ads would never run. (Mr. Romney also repudiated the proposed attack.) But Mr. Ricketts is quoted in the proposal as saying that if the nation had seen an ad featuring Mr. Wright, ''they'd never have elected Barack Obama.'' The proposal suggests Mr. Ricketts gave his preliminary approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal was prepared by Fred Davis, who made and paid for a Wright ad in 2008 but couldn't persuade Mr. McCain to run it. ''The good Reverend and his inflammatory influence have never been packaged in the proper attention-arresting way with sufficient resources to truly drill it into America's consciousness,'' his proposal said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To do that, Mr. Davis proposed showing a clip of Mr. Wright saying ''God Damn America,'' then saying the nation should have known that Mr. Obama would come up with terrible ideas like the stimulus and health care reform because of notions drilled into him by his old pastor. To defuse the inevitable attack that the ad is racist, the proposal suggests hiring ''an extremely literate, conservative African-American'' as spokesman and narrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to imagine why the plan's authors believed it would change opinions about Mr. Obama. Americans know him well and most know he is not a left-wing radical. But that's the kind of drivel money buys these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1976, individuals have been able to spend without limit on independent ads, but rarely did so because their names would have had to have been attached. By setting up a super PAC under the post-Citizens United rules, Mr. Ricketts avoids having most viewers make the connection to him and his businesses, including the Chicago Cubs. This ad may never appear, but the dozens of super PACs can be counted on to find other ways to pollute the campaign.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Ricketts, an up-by-the-bootstraps billionaire whose varied holdings include a name-brand brokerage firm in Omaha, a baseball team in Chicago, herds of bison in Wyoming and a start-up news Web site in New York, wanted to be a player in the 2012 election. On Thursday he was, though not in the way he had intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Word that Mr. Ricketts had considered bankrolling a $10 million advertising campaign linking President Obama to the incendiary race-infused statements of his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., brought waves of denunciation from Mitt Romney, the Obama campaign and much of the rest of the political world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highlighting the perils of mixing partisan politics and corporate citizenship, the reverberations also swept through the Ricketts family's business empire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal groups encouraged like-minded investors to drop their accounts with TD Ameritrade, the brokerage firm Mr. Ricketts founded. His family's plan to seek public financing for improvements to Wrigley Field, home of their baseball team, the Chicago Cubs, ran into new political opposition. And he was forced to write a letter to reporters at his New York news organization, DNAinfo.com, assuring them he believed that ''my personal politics should have absolutely no impact on your work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By early afternoon, Mr. Ricketts had announced that he had rejected the ad campaign as out of keeping with his own political style, a day after his aides indicated that it was still under consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The episode all but ensured that Republicans would remain under intense pressure not to invoke Mr. Wright's provocative statements so directly for the balance of the campaign. And, in a year when the loosened system of campaign finance regulations is encouraging wealthy individuals to weigh in on behalf of candidates and causes, Mr. Ricketts became a case study in the risks of political neophytes with big checkbooks seeking to play at the highest and roughest levels of politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a storied career, Mr. Ricketts, 70, set out to break into the exclusive but growing new fraternity of megarich, conservative ''super PAC'' donors, people willing -- and permitted as never before -- to pour millions of dollars into influencing an election. He has seemed motivated primarily by his belief that government spending is out of control and that Mr. Obama cannot be trusted to rein in the deficit and reduce the national debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But associates acknowledged that his experience on Thursday, when a confidential proposal for the Wright campaign became public in The New York Times, helped hammer home the high stakes of his decision to initiate discussions with some of the most seasoned and aggressive strategists in Republican politics about going after Mr. Obama in a high-profile way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal was drafted under the leadership of Fred Davis, a veteran political advertising strategist who worked for the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush, John McCain and, most recently, former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for Mr. Ricketts said the plan Mr. Davis's team submitted was ''merely a proposal'' and ''reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects and it was never a plan to be accepted but only a suggestion for a direction to take.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president and general counsel of the Ending Spending Political Action Fund, Brian Baker, said through a spokesman that the plan was submitted to a group that included him and two of Mr. Ricketts's sons at a meeting in Chicago last week. ''I was surprised and troubled by what I saw,'' he said. ''It was not what we asked for.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Wednesday, when Mr. Baker was asked in an interview whether Mr. Ricketts had rejected the advertising proposal, he said only that no decisions had been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A page in the proposal about potential staff members for the effort says, ''With your preliminary approval at the New York meeting, we have discussed this plan in highly confidential terms with the following proposed team members,'' who, it says, are ''ready to jump into action upon plan approval.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Associates of Mr. Ricketts acknowledged that upon seeing a commercial Mr. Davis produced in 2008 for Mr. McCain featuring Mr. Wright, which Mr. McCain rejected, Mr. Ricketts said. ''If the nation had seen that ad, they'd never have elected Barack Obama.'' The quote was highlighted in the proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ricketts was shown the commercial at an initial meeting at Mr. Davis's offices in California, which Mr. Ricketts requested as he sought to build a team of top Republican strategists to lead his foray into the presidential campaign. (Aides acknowledge that a second meeting followed in New York, where, they say, he gave Mr. Davis general directions to move ahead with a proposal that would create maximum impact for $10 million but did not specifically approve one based on Mr. Wright.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After retiring from Ameritrade's board in 2011, Mr. Ricketts began putting more energy into philanthropy and politics, initially with a nonpartisan group Taxpayers Against Earmarks. After Congress banned earmarks, the group shifted into a debt-focused organization, Ending Spending. The effort Mr. Davis was working on would have been undertaken by the group's political arm, the Ending Spending Action Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though newer to presidential politics, Mr. Ricketts has long been politically active in Nebraska. He was defeated in a local race for Republican Party chairman because he was seen as too moderate. He was a prolific donor to state candidates, investing money for ads that helped influence a United States Senate race this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ricketts is described by friends as difficult to characterize politically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is not registered in either party in Wyoming, where he spends much of his time. He is a fiscal conservative who has grown increasingly frustrated at the economic and tax policies of the Obama administration. He also has supported Democrats who he perceives have a good record on spending restraint. ''Half the time he's a Libertarian and half the time he's Rush Limbaugh,'' said one associate, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ricketts family is close, friends say, but politically divided. Two of his sons, Pete and Todd, attended the meeting in Chicago last week to review the advertising proposal, which was titled, ''The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama.'' His daughter, Laura, is one of the top contributors to Mr. Obama's re-election bid and is a member of the campaign's national finance committee. His other son, Tom, is the general chairman of the Chicago Cubs and said he was not politically active.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laura Ricketts, who is gay and is a proponent of same-sex marriage, embraced her family on Thursday and said her father and brothers were ''passionate about doing what is right for the country.'' In a statement, she added, ''Though we may have diverse political views, above all we love and respect each other.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Ricketts, whose baseball team is pursuing city and state assistance for a $300 million stadium renovation, said in another statement, ''I repudiate any return to racially divisive issues in this year's presidential campaign or in any setting -- like my father has. My focus is on one of the great American pastimes, baseball.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps no comment received more attention on Thursday than that of Mr. Romney, who said at a press briefing in Jacksonville, Fla., ''I repudiate that effort.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think it's the wrong course for a PAC or a campaign,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney also said that he had been a victim of ''character assassination'' from the Obama campaign, referring specifically to a new campaign commercial that suggested his work in the private equity firm Bain Capital was meant to imply that, ''I'm not a good person or a good guy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's statement was a clear signal to outside groups that he and his strategists have no desire to wade into the commentary of Mr. Wright, preferring to remain focused on Mr. Obama's economic record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Baker said Thursday that whatever messages Mr. Ricketts backs during the rest of the campaign would ''be focused entirely on questions of fiscal policy, not attacks that seek to divide us socially or culturally.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney almost matched President Obama in fund-raising during April after securing his party's presidential nomination and joining forces with the Republican National Committee, the campaign will announce on Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney and the R.N.C. raised $40.1 million in April, just shy of the $43.6 million that Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee raised for the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contributions on behalf of Mr. Romney represent a huge jump over the $12.6 million that his campaign raised in March. The increase was made possible by donors coalescing around Mr. Romney as the nominee and the larger donations that can be directed to the party, campaign officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Voters are tired of President Obama's broken promises,'' said Reince Priebus, the chairman of the R.N.C. in a statement. ''Mitt Romney has the record and plan to turn our country around - that is why he is receiving such enthusiastic support from voters across the country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. Romney noted that the total might have been even higher if the joint fund-raising effort - known as the ''Victory'' campaign - had begun sooner. The campaign and the R.N.C. announced they were joining forces on April 4 but did not hold the first combined event until April 14, nearly halfway through the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney had lost ground in the money wars to Mr. Obama during the first quarter of 2012 as he battled with his Republican rivals for the nomination. As of the end of March, Mr. Obama had 10 times the cash on hand as Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the surge in fund-raising for Mr. Romney may begin to even the scales, at least as far as the campaigns and their official party support is concerned. Democrats still fear that outside groups like ''super PACs'' and other organizations will tip the financial balance in Mr. Romney's favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement set to go out on Thursday morning, Mr. Romney's campaign will report a cash-on-hand total of $61.4 million as of the end of April. The campaign says that 95 percent of the donations in April were $250 or less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We are pleased with the strong support we have received from Americans across the country who are looking for new leadership in the White House,'' said Spencer Zwick, Mr. Romney's finance chairman, in the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign contributions will help finance an air war between the candidates that is already well under way. Mr. Obama has announced a $25 million television ad campaign for May aimed at boosting his record as president. And outside groups backing Mr. Romney have pledged millions more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Romney also has the challenge of catching up to Mr. Obama in staffing campaign offices around the country. Mr. Obama's Chicago-based campaign has spent months opening field offices and hiring staff while Mr. Romney fought for the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns have set ambitious goals for fund-raising. Mr. Romney's advisers have said he could raise as much as $800 million for his White House bid. Mr. Obama's campaign has said they might raise close to $750 million for the president.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Thursday confirmed two nominees chosen by President Obama for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, overcoming Republican objections and bringing the seven-member board to full strength for the first time since 2006, before the economic crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Harvard economist Jeremy C. Stein and the investment banker and lawyer Jerome H. Powell were confirmed easily after a morning of debate. The vote for Mr. Stein was 70 to 24, and for Mr. Powell, 74 to 21. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither has widely known views on the central policy questions facing the Fed: whether to take more action to reduce unemployment or whether the economy is already at risk of a dangerous acceleration of inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican and a member of the Banking Committee, held up the nominations, saying the two men would be ''rubber stamps'' for the policies of the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and, by implication, the Obama administration. Mr. Bernanke has already done more to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment than many of his conservative critics favor, while other critics -- predominantly liberal -- argue that he has not done enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After JPMorgan Chase's recently acknowledged trading losses, which raised questions about whether the Fed and other agencies had a tight enough hand on the regulatory reins, Senate Democratic leaders found enough votes to surmount objections from Mr. Vitter and others. Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, explicitly linked the vote to the JPMorgan Chase matter, saying the bank had been behaving as if its business were a game of craps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to setting interest rates based on the economy's condition, the Fed also is one of the main regulators of financial businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both of the new governors are experienced in financial regulation, Mr. Powell as a senior Treasury Department official under President George H. W. Bush, and Mr. Stein as an adviser to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Fed watchers have expressed concern that the institution has been operating below full capacity for so long. Mr. Obama had been slow to fill all of the vacancies, and Republicans had blocked some of his nominees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, put a hold on the nomination of Peter A. Diamond, a Nobel laureate in economics, causing Mr. Diamond to withdraw last June. On Thursday, some senators expressed hope that the vote would lead to broader comity. For too long, said Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican of Tennessee, being in the Senate had felt like ''being invited to join the Grand Ole Opry and not being allowed to sing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said, ''We hope it can set the tone for agreements well into the future, this year and in 2013 as well,''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A White House statement expressed gratitude that ''both parties have come together'' for the votes on Mr. Stein and Mr. Powell. ''Today's broad bipartisan vote in the Senate reflects their deep knowledge of economic and monetary policy, as well as their distinguished backgrounds and unique experience,'' it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the debate on the Senate floor, Mr. Vitter made clear that he opposed the candidates, and that he opposed the Fed's monetary policy of low interest rates. ''This Federal Reserve has set essentially a zero interest rate policy, an extremely easy policy for an extended period of time,'' he said, calling it a ''very dangerous policy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the regulatory front, Mr. Vitter said, approving the two new members would make it easier for the board to enact rules carrying out the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law and pushing ''those regulations to the left, if you will.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two nominees were confirmed by a voice vote of the Senate Banking Committee on March 29, and neither is controversial in his own right. But Senate Republicans have blocked many of Mr. Obama's nominees, out of a broader opposition to his policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said he would vote to confirm the nominees, saying they were qualified even though he believed they were not as ''hawkish'' on inflation as he would like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Corker expressed hope that, if Mitt Romney won the presidential election, Democrats would not stand in the way when he nominated the next Fed chairman and vice chairman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Questions about President Obama's race, religion and the place of his birth diverted the conversation from the economy. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the darker side of politics is always close to the surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama and his rival,Mitt Romney, have said for months that the 2012 election will be about the economy. But on Thursday, it became - at least for the day - all about the long-simmering issues of race and religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continuing economic struggles in the country are still certain to dominate the campaign debate in the next six months. The unemployment rate remains above 8 percent, the housing slump continues, debt is rising rapidly and overseas economies are flailing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the events of Thursday suggest that it does not take much to divert the presidential conversation back into the sensitive and politically dangerous questions of Mr. Obama's race, his religion and the place of his birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the morning, a report in The Times exposed a secret plan by Republican strategists and financiers to rekindle questions about the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Mr. Obama's onetime pastor and his angry, black-power rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the afternoon, the conservative Drudge Report Web site published a headline: &quot;BORN IN KENYA,&quot; based on a three-decade-old promotional booklet for a publisher that included an inaccurate biography of Mr. Obama. It stayed on the site for much of the afternoon.<BR><BR>The headline linked to a report at Breitbart news, another conservative site, which suggests that the booklet represents &quot;a pattern in which Obama - or the people representing and supporting him - manipulate his public persona.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney on Thursday repudiated the plan to use Mr. Wright's religious rhetoric as a racially tinged cudgel against Mr. Obama. But the report served to once again divert the campaign away from the economy and onto the tricky terrain of racial politics in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that led reporters to recall previously ignored comments that Mr. Romney made in February suggesting that Mr. Obama wanted to make America into &quot;a less Christian nation.&quot; Asked if he stood by those comments, Mr. Romney said that he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not familiar, precisely, with exactly what I said, but I stand by what I said, whatever it was,&quot; Mr. Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. Obama say they were not surprised by the day's events and that they remained prepared to respond even more forcefully - with television ads, if necessary - if the religion or race-based attacks return later in the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the extent that this ever raises its head, we will certainly be ready with a forceful response,&quot; said one adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, who requested anonymity to discuss strategy. &quot;But the fact is, the American people will be as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign advisers said they believed the American people had largely dismissed the questions about his birth and about links to his former pastor. They pointed to polls that show that the president remains personally likable among a majority of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American people know who he is. They know him as a leader and a father. They know his character,&quot; the adviser said. &quot;While it's clear that there are some on the other side who would be willing to engage in these attacks, we don't think they will be effective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, especially in the era of &quot;super PAC&quot; politics, it is clear that issues that were thought to have been disposed of long ago can roar back into the public arena with a vengeance. Mr. Obama believed he had dealt with questions about race and Mr. Wright in a speech in 2008, only to see the issue bubble back to the surface this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney discovered the staying power of personal attacks during his primary campaign last year, when ugly questions about his Mormon faith were revived by conservative pastors who called Mormonism a &quot;cult.&quot;<BR>It has been nearly four years since Mr. Romney gave a well-received speech about his faith during his first presidential campaign, and no political opponent has attacked him directly on his religion. But as the speeches by the pastors proved, it does not take much to raise the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's advisers have rejected another religion speech, saying members of the public know Mr. Romney and his personal history in a way they did not back in 2008. But it is interesting to wonder what the campaign might be forced to do if a super PAC raised his religion in an attack ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Mr. Romney sought to divert attention from the super PAC attack plan by accusing Mr. Obama of conducting a campaign of &quot;character assassination&quot; over the past several months. He said Mr. Obama's attacks on his record at Bain Capital were designed to accuse him of not being &quot;a good person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in truth, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney and their campaigns have shied away from the charged issues of race and religion as they begin the final six months of campaigning for the White House. Their actions suggest that - at least for now - there remains a line that neither side is willing to cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is: will the super-rich backers of super PACs play by the same rules?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians, consultants and voters are all bracing for the answer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney unveiled a series of television ads in English and Spanish on Friday, kicking off his campaign's general election advertising effort with a short and straightforward commercial that lays out what &quot;President Romney&quot; would accomplish on his first day in office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Called &quot;Day One,&quot; the ad focuses on a number of economic policies that Mr. Romney considers priorities. And while it is not an attack ad in the conventional sense, it takes a few swipes at President Obama, accusing him of standing in the way of job creation and stymieing growth through government-mandated health care. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad highlights Mr. Romney's support for the Keystone Pipeline, an expansive system of pipes that would deliver oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. The president's efforts to slow the development of the project have infuriated many conservatives and become a flash point in the debate over the Obama administration's energy policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What would a Romney presidency be like?&quot; the commercial asks. &quot;Day one, President Romney immediately approves the Keystone Pipeline, creating thousands of jobs that Obama blocked. President Romney introduces tax cuts and reforms that reward job creators, not punish them. President Romney issues order to begin replacing ObamaCare with common sense health care reform. That's what a Romney presidency will be like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Spanish version, called &quot;Dia Uno&quot; is identical in its message. Mr. Romney, who has often been criticized by Hispanic leaders for embracing tough illegal immigration laws, has not been nearly as visible as President Obama has in his television advertising efforts to reach Hispanics. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Ricketts, the billionaire behind a new super PAC effort to oppose President Obama, describes himself as a political independent concerned chiefly with the ballooning federal deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TD Ameritrade founder, however, has emerged as an increasingly active player in conservative politics in recent years, contributing more than $1 million with his wife, Marlene, to GOP candidates and causes since 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, little-known Nebraska state Sen. Deb Fischer captured the GOP nomination for the U.S. Senate after a last-minute, $250,000 ad blitz by the Ricketts-funded super PAC. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ricketts, whose family owns the Chicago Cubs, was at the center of a political firestorm Thursday after The New York Times reported he was weighing a plan to mount a $10 million campaign to remind voters of Obama's ties to his former pastor Jeremiah Wright. The proposal, overseen by GOP strategist Fred Davis, calls for commercials linking Obama to incendiary remarks by Wright, whose race-focused sermons made him a controversial figure in the 2008 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news roiled the presidential race. Obama campaign manager Jim Messina denounced it as &quot;character assassination,&quot; and some Republicans distanced themselves from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Brian Baker, president of Ricketts' Ending Spending Action Fund, said the plan &quot;reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects.&quot; Baker described it as nothing more than a proposal submitted by one of the several &quot;third-party vendors&quot; that was never accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis has ties to Ricketts' political operation. Last week, the super PAC paid $54,000 to Davis' company, Strategic Perception, to produce ads in the Nebraska Senate race. Davis, who worked for  George W. Bush and John McCain, is known for his attention-getting commercials, including one in which 2010 Republican Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell of Delaware declared, &quot;I'm not a witch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Ricketts nor Davis responded to interview requests. A statement from Strategic Perception said the Ricketts family &quot;never approved&quot; the ad campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy underscores the intensity of the presidential election six months away and the potential of outside groups to change the course of the campaign. Super PACs, new groups that can accept millions in corporate and union money but must operate independently of candidates, have spent more than $100 million to influence November's elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody with a big checkbook and point of view can get their message out there without the restraints that a campaign has,&quot; said Bill Allison of the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation, which tracks political money. &quot;They are in attack mode, and this is going to make our politics a lot more ugly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, repudiated the Wright advertising strategy hours after the Obama campaign complained he had responded too tepidly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's the wrong course for a PAC or a campaign,&quot; Romney said.  &quot;I hope that our campaigns can respectively be about the future and about issues and about a vision for America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 54-page advertising plan, titled &quot;Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End His Spending For Good,&quot; criticizes Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for not highlighting the ties between Obama and Wright more aggressively when he ran for president in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm proud of our campaign, and I believe we did the right thing, and I would do it over again today,&quot; McCain told USA TODAY on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Ricketts, one of Ricketts' sons and chairman of the Chicago Cubs, issued a statement rejecting &quot;any return to racially divisive issues in this year's presidential campaign.&quot; The baseball team has been in talks with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former chief of staff, about renovations to Wrigley Field.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney and the Republican Party raised a combined $40.1million in April, a figure that nearly matches the Democratic haul last month and shows the Republican Party coalescing around its presumptive nominee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By comparison, President Obama and the Democratic National Committee raised about $43.6million in April. Both candidates share their fundraising with the national party and state committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters are tired of President Obama's broken promises,&quot; Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement released by the Romney campaign. &quot;Mitt Romney has the record and plan to turn our country around -- that is why he is receiving such enthusiastic support from voters across the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign says there is $61.4 million in the bank.  Nearly all -- 95% -- of the contributions last month came in chunks of $250 or less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are pleased with the strong support we have received from Americans across the country who are looking for new leadership in the White House,&quot; Romney Victory National Finance Chairman Spencer Zwick said in a statement. &quot;Along with the hard work of the Republican National Committee, we will continue to raise the funds necessary to defeat President Obama in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney began jointly raising money for the fall campaign with the RNC and various state party committees only last month when it became clear he would become the Republican presidential nominee. Their goal is to raise $800 million for the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much was raised by each entity will be clearer this weekend. Candidates must file financial reports to the Federal Election Commission by midnight Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney spent $78.6 million during the primary, more than double his nearest competitor on the Republican side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign's fundraising has increased steadily the closer he has inched to the nomination. In January, the campaign raised $6.4 million. By February, that number was $11.6 million,  followed by $12.7 million more in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those numbers do not include the tens of millions of dollars raised and spent by pro-Romney super PACs during the primary campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One group, Restore Our Future, launched several blistering attacks on the former Massachusetts governor's rivals during critical early contests, drawing loud complaints from those candidates on the receiving end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other outside groups have pledged to raise millions to help Republicans win the White House. Crossroad GPS, a super PAC affiliated with Republican strategist Karl Rove, announced this week it was starting a $25million ad campaign against Obama in key states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crossroads GPS said it will first spend $8 million to air an ad titled &quot;Obama's Promise&quot; in 10 battleground states. The ad started airing Thursday and will run through May 31. <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney wants to talk about the economy. But his ostensible allies keep interrupting him, and his own party is threatening to drown him out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reality of modern campaigning is that any candidate - even one as buttoned-down and  disciplined as Romney - has to contend with stronger political crosswinds than in the past. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest example came Thursday, a day on which the Republican presidential front-runner had intended to talk about the federal debt. That message was largely lost as he found himself having to repudiate an attack against President Obama that had not happened - and one his campaign was not involved in planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy surrounded a New York Times report that a group of political operatives had proposed a racially tinged $10 million ad campaign designed to resurrect a four-year-old controversy over inflammatory remarks by the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., Obama's former pastor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to make it very clear: I repudiate that effort,&quot; Romney said at a news conference. &quot;I think it's the wrong course. . . . I hope that our campaigns can respectively be about the future and about issues and about a vision for America.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's response was more forceful than it has been in other recent episodes, including when he did not challenge a supporter who declared at an Ohio rally this month that Obama &quot;should be tried for treason&quot; and when he declined to condemn radio host Rush Limbaugh for calling a Georgetown law student a &quot;slut.&quot;          Even when Romney manages to stick to his economic message, he must grapple with the fact that it will not necessarily be the dominant one that voters are hearing from the Republican Party.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, for instance, GOP congressional leaders conjured a flashback to one of the more disagreeable episodes of recent political history. In a speech Tuesday, House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) declared that Congress should see the need to raise the nation's $16.4 trillion debt limit - which the Treasury Department has said will be necessary early next year - as an opportunity to adopt major spending cuts and entitlement reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Ronald H. Johnson (Wis.), one of Romney's formal liaisons to Capitol Hill, said that any conversation about budgets and deficits by congressional Republicans helps Romney by highlighting Obama's inability to cut the debt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he also said Boehner's comments may have stepped on a potentially more powerful message for Romney: the Senate's unanimous rejection of the president's budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we can all do a better job of making sure we're all talking about the same issues, at the same time, using the same facts and figures, coordinating our efforts,&quot; Johnson said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, however, has less power than presidential nominees once did to control the political narrative, largely because congressional Republicans have a greater role than they used to in shaping the party's identity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans now see themselves as a congressionally based party, [although] having the presidency every once in a while is useful,&quot; said Grover Norquist, an anti-tax activist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where George W. Bush in his 2000 presidential campaign had the liberty to treat congressional Republicans as an occasional foil - for instance, accusing them of trying &quot;to balance the budget on the backs of the poor&quot; - Romney has had to follow their lead on many issues. This includes his endorsement of a plan by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that would, among other things, transform the Medicare program.&quot;If Romney is president, he will sign a bill that looks very much like Ryan, and we will call it 'the Romney revolution,' &quot; Norquist said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And because of a weakening of campaign finance laws, well-funded outside groups can raise issues and drive messages that the candidate would prefer to avoid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertising campaign proposed by a group of operatives - led by Republican consultant Fred Davis - was out of bounds, even in today's brutal political climate. It referred to Obama as &quot;the metrosexual, black Abe Lincoln&quot; and said that his former association with Wright is &quot;a phenomenally powerful argument that's never been properly exploited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That relationship became a major topic in the 2008 campaign, when it was revealed that Obama's longtime pastor had a history of making inflammatory statements, including a declaration that the United States had brought upon itself the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama not only distanced himself from the Chicago clergyman but also gave a major address on race in which he said that Wright's views &quot;denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation&quot; and &quot;rightly offend white and black alike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal to revive the issue was denounced from many quarters - including brokerage-firm founder Joe Ricketts, who the political consultants had hoped would bankroll it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects and it was never a plan to be accepted but only a suggestion for a direction to take,&quot; Ricketts's super PAC, Ending Spending Action, said in a statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that &quot;Ricketts intends to work hard to help elect a President this fall who shares his commitment to economic responsibility, but his efforts are and will continue to be focused entirely on questions of fiscal policy, not attacks that seek to divide us socially or culturally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign quickly responded with a mass fundraising appeal, warning supporters: &quot;This is going to be worse than we could have imagined. President Obama needs your help to stop it before it starts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis did not respond to a request for comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A complicating factor for Romney is that he is not the most adept or agile of politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a reporter on Thursday cited a February interview in which he suggested that Wright had helped shape Obama's worldview, the former Massachusetts governor replied awkwardly: &quot;I'm not familiar precisely with exactly what I said but I stand by what I said, whatever it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's campaign officials insisted that neither they nor voters are being thrown off stride. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This race is always going to be about one thing,&quot; the future of the economy, Romney strategist Stuart Stevens said. &quot;We're going to be held responsible for the campaign we do run, not the campaign we don't run. And we hope the Obama campaign will be held responsible for the campaign they are running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls suggest that voters still don't have a clear idea of what Romney stands for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was probably no accident that, as the likely GOP nominee was preparing to go onstage Thursday at a rally in Jacksonville, Fla., the song that the campaign chose to warm up the crowd was the Elvis Presley classic &quot;A Little Less Conversation.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First it was Sheldon Adelson, a casino mogul who helped finance Newt Gingrich's presidential ambitions. Then it was Foster Friess, a multimillionaire with the propensity for off-color jokes who threw his money behind Rick Santorum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest wealthy businessman to grab headlines in this year's presidential contest is someone less splashy, who made a splash on Thursday nonetheless: Joe Ricketts, the low-key founder of Omaha-based TD Ameritrade, emerged in connection with a plan to blitz the airwaves with provocative attacks on President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A billionaire philanthropist with a particular interest in opposing earmarks, Ricketts had previously played a bit part on the political scene. But he took an unflattering turn in the spotlight Thursday with a New York Times article that said a report he commissioned detailed how his super PAC, Ending Spending, could put $10 million toward an ad campaign about Obama and the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., his controversial former pastor.          Ricketts and his family, which owns the Chicago Cubs and includes a high-profile Obama fundraiser, moved quickly Thursday to disavow the racially charged idea.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only was this plan merely a proposal - one of several submitted to the Ending Spending Action Fund by third-party vendors - but it reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects, and it was never a plan to be accepted but only a suggestion for a direction to take,&quot; Brian Baker, president of the fund, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dust-up highlights a danger for presidential campaigns in the era of super PACs, which have made it easier for wealthy individuals and corporations to spend freely on campaigns. Although the candidates may reap the benefits of that spending, they also face the risk that the groups or their donors will go rogue, pursuing lines of attack that reflect on them negatively.Romney was forced repeatedly Thursday to comment on the proposal - overseen by GOP ad man Fred Davis - which derided Obama as a &quot;metrosexual, black Abe Lincoln.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to make it very clear: I repudiate that effort,&quot; Romney told reporters in Florida. &quot;I think it's the wrong course for a PAC or a campaign. I hope that our campaigns can respectively be about the future and about issues and about vision for America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberals seized on the incident, with the group Americans United calling for a boycott of Ameritrade &quot;until they publicly call on Ricketts to shut down his hate-spewing super PAC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident highlighted the relatively private Ricketts, 70, who has recently increased his participation in conservative politics and is poised to play a significant role in the 2012 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ricketts has an unusual profile for a rising political player, with little in his rsum to suggest that he favors controversial or attention-getting tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Democrat who became a Republican, he later renounced all party affiliation to become an independent. His daughter, Laura, is a lesbian activist and prominent bundler for Obama; she raised about half a million dollars for the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have different political views on how to achieve what is best for the future of America, but we agree that each of us is entitled to our own views and our right to voice those views,&quot; Laura Ricketts said in a statement today. &quot;Above all we love and respect each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ricketts's children have roles with the Cubs, which is seeking help from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) to renovate the team's 98-year-old stadium, Wrigley Field. Emanuel, Obama's former chief of staff, is &quot;livid&quot; with the Ricketts family, an aide to the mayor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a 2006 Omaha World-Herald profile of one son, Pete Ricketts, who ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate, Joe Ricketts wouldn't allow any of his children to work for Ameritrade before their 30th birthday, wanting them to expand their horizons before returning to the family business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family's net worth has been ranked as high as 93rd on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans. In 2009, Joe Ricketts ranked 371st, with assets estimated at $1 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to friends, Ricketts has rarely sought the spotlight or spoken publicly. He left the Ameritrade board of directors in February but gave little indication that he intended to become more involved in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think he seeks to be the public face of anything like that, but I would say the things that he believes in, he's very passionate about,&quot; said Robert Slezak, a former Ameritrade executive who worked with Ricketts for a decade. &quot;I think he would prefer to deflect the spotlight on someone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Ricketts has been an emerging financial force in politics in recent years, initially by starting an anti-earmark campaign called Taxpayers Against Earmarks. He donated $1.1 million to Ending Spending ahead of the 2010 midterm elections, with the bulk spent opposing Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, Ricketts helped guide Nebraska state Sen. Deb Fischer to an upset victory in the GOP Senate primary with a late $250,000 infusion. Ending Spending also is supporting Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) in his recall election next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Ricketts is a top donor this year to the Campaign for Primary Accountability, a group that has targeted long-time incumbents regardless of their party affiliation or politics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old advertising slogan &quot;Strong enough for a man, but made for a woman&quot; sure doesn't apply to the military's body armor. Seems the gear that protects troops from all kinds of nasty stuff isn't exactly made with women's figures in mind - and that's causing problems as more women take on combat roles.          But never fear, ladies in arms! The House Armed Services Committee feels your pain - well, not literally, but hey, at least it's working on it. The panel praised the Army for its attention to the issue, and has directed the secretary of the Army to assess whether there's an &quot;operational need&quot; for gear tailored to women.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dearth of female-friendly military gear is nothing new: There have long been complaints about maternity versions of the branches' uniforms. And women have found that the body armor created with men in mind - that more women are wearing in war zones in Afghanistan - is often too big and doesn't accommodate their figures.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the panel's report accompanying the FY 2013 defense-authorization bill, the Armed Services Committee directs the Army secretary to brief congressional committees within six months about its progress on protective equipment for female soldiers. They note that the budget request included $15 million to develop better protective gear and an additional $11.9 million to create prototypes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which sounds like enough for plenty of souped-up Spanx.          Hook, lines and sinker          Newspaper and television reporters working a story often sweat it out, desperately waiting for someone, anyone, to give them the perfect quote or anecdote.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we come to find out - who knew? - that all those perfect &quot;man on the street&quot; (MOS) quotes in campaign ads are actually fed to sincere and earnest American &quot;voters&quot; - or actors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, for example, the &quot;storyboard&quot; put together by GOP ad wizard </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Fred Davis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">for a proposed ad campaign opposing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">President Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, has an announcer say it took 200 years to build up the national debt that has been amassed every year of the Obama administration.          Then we cut to an extreme close-up of an older man who says: &quot;The debt that took two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">centuries</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to build he did in 365 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">DAYS</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">?&quot; (Proper emphasis included.)          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to drive home the point, an older woman then says: &quot;That's HIS debt. He can't blame anyone else for that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the announcer bashes Obama's &quot;bowing, begging, kneeling and apologizing for America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis proposes a &quot;senior citizen veteran MOS,&quot; wearing a military hat who will then say: &quot;That's not what I fought for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man, that is sooo much easier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Sink or swim          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon entering a soiree, veterans of the Washington party circuit typically identify key logistics: location of the bar, the most important person in the room, and the exits (so they can make a swift and surreptitious getaway).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sneaking out early won't be an option at a novel fundraiser for Rep. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Andy Harris</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">                          being held next month. The Maryland Republican will be heading for the open waters with donors during an &quot;afternoon cruise&quot; on the Potomac. And in what is surely a relief to would-be attendees, the event will last only two hours. Promising a &quot;three-hour tour&quot; would surely dampen RSVPs for all but the most ardent &quot;Gilligan's Island&quot; fans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the idea of being confined to a small craft (it's being held on a 55-person-capacity boat called &quot;Finished Business&quot;) with no hope for escape might be enough to make a free-range lobbyist break out in hives. And think of all the potential for disaster that so often befalls seafaring travelers: Norwalk viruses, rough waves, icebergs, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admission to the event, which is being sponsored by the National Marine Manufacturers' Boat PAC, might leave you all wet. It's $2,500 to be named a co-captain, $1,000 for a PAC and $250 for an individual.          Life jackets included.           He shall not be named          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">George W. Bush</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">is shaping up to be the invisible man of the 2012 presidential campaign. The former president's presence has been &quot;low key,&quot; our colleague </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Karen Tumulty</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">noted this week. But now, old 43 is in danger of disappearing altogether.          In what we're dubbing the Loop's favorite quote of the week, Republican front-runner </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mitt Romney</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - who had just gotten Bush's endorsement, seemed to forget Bush's name. Speaking on Wednesday, the former Massachusetts governor bashed President Obama, saying that when Obama campaigned in 2008, he &quot;was very critical of his predecessor, because the predecessor put together $4 trillion of debt over eight years.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The predecessor?&quot; Meaning, uh, George W. Bush? Maybe the name had escaped him, or he found the pronunciation too tricky. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney continued with the former-president-who-shall-not-be-named routine, saying later: &quot;I find it incomprehensible that a president [Obama] could come to office and call his predecessor's [wait, who?] record irresponsible and unpatriotic, and then do almost nothing to fix it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Good news and bad          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             As expected, longtime Asia hand </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Derek Mitchell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, now the special representative for Burma and the architect of the current diplomatic policy, is the pick to be Washington's first ambassador to Burma since 1990.The White House announcement coincided with the arrival in Washington on Thursday of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Wunna Maung Lwin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Burma's foreign minister, who met with Secretary of State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hillary Rodham Clinton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the administration, in recognition of some political reforms - and democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi's recent electoral win - after years of military rule, announced the easing of some restrictions on investment and trade with the country, also known as Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news for Mitchell? If confirmed by the Senate, he's going to be ambassador to Burma. The bad news? He's going to be ambassador to Burma.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney is catching up in the race for campaign cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney and the Republican National Committee, which is spending money on behalf of the Republican candidate, brought in $40.1 million during April, according to a campaign statement. That's just shy of the $43.6 million raised by the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee during the same period.          The figures represent a turn of fortune for Romney in comparison with the previous month. When Romney became the presumptive nominee, he started raising money for the RNC at his fundraisers and collecting checks of $40,000 or more from one person. In March, he raised $12.7 million, compared with $35.1 million for the president's campaign.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has stepped up fundraising in recent weeks with events every day or two. On Thursday, he held a $50,000-a-plate lunch fundraiser at the Epping Forest Yacht Club in Jacksonville, Fla., decrying President Obama's plans to let tax cuts on the wealthy expire. A day earlier, Romney said he raised $2 million during an event in Coral Gables, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign appears to have had a boost in small-dollar contributions, a crucial sign of support from donors of average means who will drive the volunteer efforts on his behalf. Until now, Romney has had weak fundraising from such small donors, lagging behind his rivals for the Republican nomination and far behind Obama's campaign.The Romney campaign reported $10.1 million coming in donations under $250, including funds for the RNC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are pleased with the strong support we have received from Americans across the country who are looking for new leadership in the White House,&quot; Spencer Zwick, the campaign's national finance chairman, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign manager Jim Messina said in an online video that 169,500 new donors gave to Obama in April, &quot;putting us within reach of 2 million donors this election cycle. . . . That makes our campaign different, and it's how we're going to build a winning organization across the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign spending in the presidential race is heating up, especially on the airwaves. Obama's campaign has begun its first significant television ad buys, announcing plans to spend $25 million during May. The campaign unveiled spots this week attacking Romney's record as the head of Bain Capital.          The conservative group Crossroads GPS announced its own $25  million round of advertising over the next four weeks, attacking Obama over job creation, his signature health-care law and the national debt.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's push onto the airwaves is not enough to match what conservative interest groups are spending. Obama spent $3.6 million on broadcast television for the week ending Sunday, according to Kantar Media/CMAG.Two conservative groups, Americans for Prosperity and the Romney-backing super PAC Restore Our Future, spent a combined $4 million that week. Romney's campaign has not started running ads since he effectively secured the GOP nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama's campaign appears to be far ahead in mobilizing voters on the ground, opening 42 field offices and hiring 120 staffers in April.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney wants to talk about the economy. But his ostensible allies keep interrupting him, and his own party is threatening to drown him out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reality of modern campaigning is that any candidate - even one as buttoned-down and  disciplined as Romney - has to contend with stronger political crosswinds than in the past. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest example came Thursday, a day on which the Republican presidential front-runner had intended to talk about the federal debt. That message was largely lost as he found himself having to repudiate an attack against President Obama that had not happened - and one his campaign was not involved in planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy surrounded a New York Times report that a group of political operatives had proposed a racially tinged $10 million ad campaign designed to resurrect a four-year-old controversy over inflammatory remarks by the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., Obama's former pastor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to make it very clear: I repudiate that effort,&quot; Romney said at a news conference. &quot;I think it's the wrong course. . . . I hope that our campaigns can respectively be about the future and about issues and about a vision for America.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's response was more forceful than it has been in other recent episodes, including when he did not challengea supporter who declared at an Ohio rally this month that Obama &quot;should be tried for treason&quot; and when he declined to condemn radio host Rush Limbaugh for calling a Georgetown law student a &quot;slut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when Romney manages to stick to his economic message, he must grapple with the fact that it will not necessarily be the dominant one that voters are hearing from the Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, for instance, GOP congressional leaders conjured a flashback to one of the more disagreeable episodes of recent political history. In a speech Tuesday, House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) declared that Congress should see the need to raise the nation's $16.4 trillion debt limit - which the Treasury Department has said will be necessary early next year - as an opportunity to adopt major spending cuts and entitlement reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Ronald H. Johnson (Wis.), one of Romney's formal liaisons to Capitol Hill, said that any conversation about budgets and deficits by congressional Republicans helps Romney by highlighting Obama's inability to cut the debt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he also said Boehner's comments may have stepped on a potentially more powerful message for Romney: the Senate's unanimous rejection of the president's budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we can all do a better job of making sure we're all talking about the same issues, at the same time, using the same facts and figures, coordinating our efforts,&quot; Johnson said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, however, has less power than presidential nominees once did to control the political narrative, largely because congressional Republicans have a greater role than they used to in shaping the party's identity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans now see themselves as a congressionally based party, [although] having the presidency every once in a while is useful,&quot; said Grover Norquist, an anti-tax activist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where George W. Bush in his 2000 presidential campaign had the liberty to treat congressional Republicans as an occasional foil - for instance, accusing them of trying &quot;to balance the budget on the backs of the poor&quot; - Romney has had to follow their lead on many issues. This includes his endorsement of a plan by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that would, among other things, transform the Medicare program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Romney is president, he will sign a bill that looks very much like Ryan, and we will call it 'the Romney revolution,' &quot; Norquist said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And because of a weakening of campaign finance laws, well-funded outside groups can raise issues and drive messages that the candidate would prefer to avoid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertising campaign proposed by a group of operatives - led by Republican consultant Fred Davis - was out of bounds, even in today's brutal political climate. It referred to Obama as &quot;the metrosexual, black Abe Lincoln&quot; and said that his former association with Wright is &quot;a phenomenally powerful argument that's never been properly exploited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That relationship became a major topic in the 2008 campaign, when it was revealed that Obama's longtime pastor had a history of making inflammatory statements, including a declaration that the United States had brought upon itself the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama not only distanced himself from the Chicago clergyman but also gave a major address on racein which he said that Wright's views &quot;denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation&quot; and &quot;rightly offend white and black alike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal to revive the issue was denounced from many quarters - including brokerage-firm founder Joe Ricketts, who the political consultants had hoped would bankroll it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects and it was never a plan to be accepted but only a suggestion for a direction to take,&quot; Ricketts's super PAC, Ending Spending Action, said in a statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that &quot;Ricketts intends to work hard to help elect a President this fall who shares his commitment to economic responsibility, but his efforts are and will continue to be focused entirely on questions of fiscal policy, not attacks that seek to divide us socially or culturally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign quickly responded with a mass fundraising appeal, warning supporters: &quot;This is going to be worse than we could have imagined. President Obama needs your help to stop it before it starts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis did not respond to a request for comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A complicating factor for Romney is that he is not the most adept or agile of politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a reporter on Thursday cited a February interview in which he suggested that Wright had helped shape Obama's worldview, the former Massachusetts governor replied awkwardly: &quot;I'm not familiar precisely with exactly what I said but I stand by what I said, whatever it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's campaign officials insisted that neither they nor voters are being thrown off stride. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This race is always going to be about one thing,&quot; the future of the economy, Romney strategist Stuart Stevens said. &quot;We're going to be held responsible for the campaign we do run, not the campaign we don't run. And we hope the Obama campaign will be held responsible for the campaign they are running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls suggest that voters still don't have a clear idea of what Romney stands for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was probably no accident that, as the likely GOP nominee was preparing to go onstage Thursday at a rally in Jacksonville, Fla., the song that the campaign chose to warm up the crowd was the Elvis Presley classic &quot;A Little Less Conversation.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old advertising slogan &quot;Strong enough for a man, but made for a woman&quot; sure doesn't apply to the military's body armor. Seems the gear that protects troops from all kinds of nasty stuff isn't exactly made with women's figures in mind - and that's causing problems as more womentake on combat roles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But never fear, ladies in arms! The House Armed Services Committee feels your pain - well, not literally, but hey, at least it's working on it. The panel praised the Army for its attention to the issue, and has directed the secretary of the Army to assess whether there's an &quot;operational need&quot; for gear tailored to women. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dearth of female-friendly military gear is nothing new: There havelong been complaints about maternity versions of the branches' uniforms. And women have found that the body armor created with men in mind - that more women are wearing in war zones in Afghanistan - is often too big and doesn't accommodate their figures. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the panel's report accompanying the FY 2013 defense-authorization bill, the Armed Services Committee directs the Army secretary to brief congressional committees within six months about its progress on protective equipment for female soldiers. They note that the budget request included $15 million to develop better protective gear and an additional $11.9 million to create prototypes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which sounds like enough for plenty of souped-up Spanx.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hook, lines and sinker</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspaper and television reporters working a story often sweat it out, desperately waiting for someone, anyone, to give them the perfect quote or anecdote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we come to find out- who knew? - that all those perfect &quot;man on the street&quot; (MOS) quotes in campaign ads are actually fed to sincere and earnest American &quot;voters&quot; - or actors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, for example, the &quot;storyboard&quot; put together by GOP ad wizard Fred Davis for a proposed ad campaign opposing President Obama, has an announcer say it took 200 years to build up the national debt that has been amassed every year of the Obama administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then we cut to an extreme close-up of an older man who says: &quot;The debt that took two centuries to build he did in 365 DAYS?&quot; (Proper emphasis included.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to drive home the point, an older woman then says: &quot;That's HIS debt. He can't blame anyone else for that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the announcer bashes Obama's &quot;bowing, begging, kneeling and apologizing for America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis proposes a &quot;senior citizen veteran MOS,&quot; wearing a military hat who will then say: &quot;That's not what I fought for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man, that is sooo much easier.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sink or swim</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon entering a soiree, veterans of the Washington party circuit typically identify key logistics: location of the bar, the most important person in the room, and the exits (so they can make a swift and surreptitious getaway).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sneaking out early won't be an option at a novel fundraiser for Rep. Andy Harris being held next month. The Maryland Republican will be heading for the open waters with donors during an &quot;afternoon cruise&quot; on the Potomac. And in what is surely a relief to would-be attendees, the event will last only two hours. Promising a &quot;three-hour tour&quot; would surely dampen RSVPs for all but the most ardent &quot;Gilligan's Island&quot; fans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the idea of being confined to a small craft (it's being held on a 55-person-capacity boat called &quot;Finished Business&quot;) with no hope for escape might be enough to make a free-range lobbyist break out in hives. And think of all the potential for disaster that so often befalls seafaring travelers: Norwalk viruses, rough waves, icebergs, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admission to the event, which is being sponsored by the National Marine Manufacturers' Boat PAC, might leave you all wet. It's $2,500 to be named a co-captain, $1,000 for a PAC and $250 for an individual.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George W. Bush is shaping up to be the invisible man of the 2012 presidential campaign. The former president's presence has been &quot;low key,&quot; our colleague Karen Tumulty noted this week. But now, old 43is in danger of disappearing altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what we're dubbing the Loop's favorite quote of the week, Republican front-runner Mitt Romney - who had just gotten Bush's endorsement, seemed to forget Bush's name. Speaking on Wednesday, the former Massachusetts governor bashed President Obama, saying that when Obama campaigned in 2008, he &quot;was very critical of his predecessor, because the predecessor put together $4 trillion of debt over eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The predecessor?&quot; Meaning, uh, George W. Bush? Maybe the name had escaped him, or he found the pronunciation too tricky. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney continued with the former-president-who-shall-not-be-named routine, saying later: &quot;I find it incomprehensible that a president [Obama] could come to office and call his predecessor's [wait, who?] record irresponsible and unpatriotic, and then do almost nothing to fix it.&quot; <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Good news and bad</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As expected, longtime Asia hand Derek Mitchell, now the special representative for Burma and the architect of the current diplomatic policy, is the pick to be Washington's first ambassador to Burma since 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House announcement coincided with the arrival in Washington on Thursday of Wunna Maung Lwin, Burma's foreign minister, who met with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the administration, in recognition of some political reforms - and democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi's recent electoral win - after years of military rule, announced the easing of some restrictions on investment and trade with the country, also known as Myanmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news for Mitchell? If confirmed by the Senate, he's going to be ambassador to Burma. The bad news? He's going to be ambassador to Burma.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney is catching up in the race for campaign cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney and the Republican National Committee, which is spending money on behalf of the Republican candidate, brought in $40.1 million during April, according to a campaign statement. That's just shy of the $43.6 million raised by the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee during the same period. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures represent a turn of fortune for Romney in comparison with the previous month. When Romney became the presumptive nominee, he started raising money for the RNC at his fundraisers and collecting checks of $40,000 or more from one person. In March, he raised $12.7 million, compared with $35.1 million for the president's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has stepped up fundraising in recent weeks with events every day or two. On Thursday, he held a $50,000-a-plate lunch fundraiser at the Epping Forest Yacht Club in Jacksonville, Fla., decrying President Obama's plans to let tax cuts on the wealthy expire. A day earlier, Romney said he raised $2 million during an event in Coral Gables, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign appears to have had a boost in small-dollar contributions, a crucial sign of support from donors of average means who will drive the volunteer efforts on his behalf. Until now, Romney has had weak fundraisingfrom such small donors, lagging behind his rivals for the Republican nomination and far behind Obama's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign reported $10.1 million coming in donations under $250, including funds for the RNC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are pleased with the strong support we have received from Americans across the country who are looking for new leadership in the White House,&quot; Spencer Zwick, the campaign's national finance chairman, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign manager Jim Messina said in an online video that 169,500 new donors gave to Obama in April, &quot;putting us within reach of 2 million donors this election cycle. . . . That makes our campaign different, and it's how we're going to build a winning organization across the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign spending in the presidential race is heating up, especially on the airwaves. Obama's campaign has begun its first significant television ad buys, announcing plans to spend $25 million during May. The campaign unveiled spots this week attacking Romney's record as the head of Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conservative group Crossroads GPS announced its own $25  million round of advertising over the next four weeks, attacking Obama over job creation, his signature health-care law and the national debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's push onto the airwaves is not enough to match what conservative interest groups are spending. Obama spent $3.6 million on broadcast television for the week ending Sunday, according to Kantar Media/CMAG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two conservative groups, Americans for Prosperity and the Romney-backing super PAC Restore Our Future, spent a combined $4 million that week. Romney's campaign has not started running ads since he effectively secured the GOP nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama's campaign appears to be far ahead in mobilizing voters on the ground, opening 42 field offices and hiring 120 staffers in April.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First it was Sheldon Adelson, a casino mogul who helped finance Newt Gingrich's presidential ambitions. Then it was Foster Friess, a multimillionaire with the propensity for off-color jokes who threw his money behind Rick Santorum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest wealthy businessman to grab headlines in this year's presidential contest is someone less splashy, who made a splash on Thursday nonetheless: Joe Ricketts, the low-key founder of Omaha-based TD Ameritrade, emerged in connection with a plan to blitz the airwaves with provocative attacks on President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A billionaire philanthropist with a particular interest in opposing earmarks, Ricketts had previously played a bit part on the political scene. But he took an unflattering turn in the spotlight Thursday with a New York Times article that said a report he commissioned detailed how his super PAC, Ending Spending, could put $10 million toward an ad campaign about Obama and the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., his controversial former pastor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ricketts and his family, which owns the Chicago Cubs and includes a high-profile Obama fundraiser, moved quickly Thursday to disavow the racially charged idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only was this plan merely a proposal - one of several submitted to the Ending Spending Action Fund by third-party vendors - but it reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects, and it was never a plan to be accepted but only a suggestion for a direction to take,&quot; Brian Baker, president of the fund, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dust-up highlights a danger for presidential campaigns in the era of super PACs, which have made it easier for wealthy individuals and corporations to spend freely on campaigns. Although the candidates may reap the benefits of that spending, they also face the risk that the groups or their donors will go rogue, pursuing lines of attack that reflect on them negatively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney was forced repeatedly Thursday to comment on the proposal - overseen by GOP ad man Fred Davis - which derided Obama as a &quot;metrosexual, black Abe Lincoln.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to make it very clear: I repudiate that effort,&quot; Romney told reporters in Florida. &quot;I think it's the wrong course for a PAC or a campaign. I hope that our campaigns can respectively be about the future and about issues and about vision for America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberals seized on the incident, with the group Americans United calling for a boycott of Ameritrade &quot;until they publicly call on Ricketts to shut down his hate-spewing super PAC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident highlighted the relatively private Ricketts, 70, who has recently increased his participation in conservative politics and is poised to play a significant role in the 2012 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ricketts has an unusual profile for a rising political player, with little in his rsum to suggest that he favors controversial or attention-getting tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Democrat who became a Republican, he later renounced all party affiliation to become an independent. His daughter, Laura, is a lesbian activist and prominent bundler for Obama; she raised about half a million dollars for the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have different political views on how to achieve what is best for the future of America, but we agree that each of us is entitled to our own views and our right to voice those views,&quot; Laura Ricketts said in a statement today. &quot;Above all we love and respect each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ricketts's children have roles with the Cubs, which is seeking help from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) to renovate the team's 98-year-old stadium, Wrigley Field. Emanuel, Obama's former chief of staff, is &quot;livid&quot; with the Ricketts family, an aide to the mayor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a 2006 Omaha World-Herald profile of one son, Pete Ricketts, who ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate, Joe Ricketts wouldn't allow any of his children to work for Ameritrade before their 30th birthday, wanting them to expand their horizons before returning to the family business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family's net worth has been ranked as high as 93rd on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans. In 2009, Joe Ricketts ranked 371st, with assets estimated at $1 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to friends, Ricketts has rarely sought the spotlight or spoken publicly. He left the Ameritrade board of directors in February but gave little indication that he intended to become more involved in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think he seeks to be the public face of anything like that, but I would say the things that he believes in, he's very passionate about,&quot; said Robert Slezak, a former Ameritrade executive who worked with Ricketts for a decade. &quot;I think he would prefer to deflect the spotlight on someone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Ricketts has been an emerging financial force in politics in recent years, initially by starting an anti-earmark campaign called Taxpayers Against Earmarks. He donated $1.1 million to Ending Spending ahead of the 2010 midterm elections, with the bulk spent opposing Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, Ricketts helped guide Nebraska state Sen. Deb Fischer to an upset victory in the GOP Senate primary with a late $250,000 infusion. Ending Spending also is supporting Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) in his recall election next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Ricketts is a top donor this year to the Campaign for Primary Accountability, a group that has targeted long-time incumbents regardless of their party affiliation or politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has a lot of different interests, and he's at a point in his life where he can spend his time and money on things that interest him and are important to him, and that includes the political world around him,&quot; said Mark Quandahl, a friend and former chairman of the Nebraska Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ricketts owns a successful new New York news Web site, DNAinfo.com; a natural bison meat producer; and the upstart American Film Company, which produced the 2010 Robert Redford movie &quot;The Conspirator,&quot; a historical documentary about the legal aftermath of Abraham Lincoln's assassination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential campaign is erupting into a full-scale advertising war, with both candidates and their allies pouring huge sums into early and aggressive efforts to define the fight on their terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least $50 million worth of ads will appear in swing states in the next several weeks as President Obama and Mitt Romney move swiftly to win over voters now, casting aside concerns that their money will be wasted on people who are not paying much attention five and a half months before Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest volley came on Wednesday, when Crossroads GPS, a political group formed by Karl Rove and other top Republican strategists, unveiled a $25 million advertising campaign. The group opened with a hard-hitting commercial that casts Mr. Obama as a failed leader, unable to deliver on his pledges to fix the country's problems. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''President Obama's agenda promised so much,'' it says over the sound of breaking glass. ''He hasn't even come close. We need solutions, not just promises.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Crossroads campaign matches the $25 million advertising offensive that the Obama campaign began last week. Other outside political groups and ''super PACs'' have committed at least an additional $15 million in recent weeks, mostly to Mr. Romney's benefit, according to Kantar Media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is almost certainly more to come before the highly viewed spring television schedule winds down for the summer. Many central players, including the Democratic and Republican Party committees and Mr. Romney's campaign, have been largely absent from TV in recent weeks and are sitting on large piles of cash. Mr. Romney, who had more than $10 million in the bank at the end of March and has been busily raising money in the last few weeks, has not advertised since Rick Santorum dropped his bid for the Republican nomination a month ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a high volume of ads coming before the summer -- many of them negative and concentrated in a handful of battleground states -- further reinforces the belief among political strategists that this election will see an unusually heavy and vicious air war as outside political groups assume a larger role than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In dueling sets of ads, each side offers its perspective on the improvement, or lack thereof, that the country has made under Mr. Obama. The new Crossroads ad pushes the narrative that despite his lofty vision for a better America, Mr. Obama -- and indeed the nation -- has made little progress in three and a half years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its ads, the Obama campaign tries to remind voters of the deep economic crisis the president inherited and argues that he has set the country on the right path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's still too hard for too many,'' the opening ad of his $25 million campaign says. ''We're not there yet. It's still too hard for too many. But we're coming back.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In previous years, ad spending has been heavy but not as narrowly focused on such a small number of states. In 2004, for example, George W. Bush's campaign was spending $5 million every week on television ads after Senator John Kerry emerged as the Democratic nominee. But the campaign initially spread its advertising over 17 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think the key word is concentrated,'' said Kenneth M. Goldstein, president of Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group. ''This tells us that it's not 13 or 14 states that matter. It's seven or eight.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Crossroads ads, set to start running on Thursday, the president and his opponents will be on television head to head in nine states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rush to advertise now reflects a belief among political strategists on both sides that they have a small window of time to frame the election. Only a few weeks remain before the busy television-watching season slows down and summer reruns begin. The Olympics start at the end of July, a time when most Americans will hardly be thinking about politics. Many strategists believe they will not have an opportunity to connect with voters again until the political conventions begin in late August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The first ads that are run are in many ways the most important because the mind is the most open and uncluttered at that point,'' said Carter Eskew, a veteran Democratic strategist. By late summer and early fall, he said, political advertising has reached the saturation point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Most people are sick of it because you have ads for president, then Senate, then dog catcher and assistant dog catcher,'' he said. ''It's back to back to back.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Crossroads campaign fills a void in those crucial states. Mr. Romney's super PAC has been running ads sporadically, including a sarcasm-laden Mother's Day spot that took two notable Democrats to task for their dismissive comments about Ann Romney, a stay-at-home mother. ''Happy Mother's Day from Barack Obama's team,'' said the narrator, a soft-spoken woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, however, has been quiet. Stuart Stevens, a senior Romney strategist, would not elaborate on Wednesday about the campaign's plans. But Romney videographers have been interviewing people across the country about their economic woes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The role of super PACs in providing that auxiliary support has been essential, experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's to your advantage to offload your work to the super PACs,'' said Erika Franklin Fowler, director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political ads. ''In a world in which campaigns can't technically coordinate with super PACs, one way of doing things is waiting to see what the other is doing and then filling in the gaps.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- A group of high-profile Republican strategists is working with a conservative billionaire on a proposal to mount one of the most provocative campaigns of the ''super PAC'' era and attack President Obama in ways that Republicans have so far shied away from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timed to upend the Democratic National Convention in September, the plan would ''do exactly what John McCain would not let us do,'' the strategists wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan, which is awaiting approval, calls for running commercials linking Mr. Obama to incendiary comments by his former spiritual adviser, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., whose race-related sermons made him a highly charged figure in the 2008 campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The world is about to see Jeremiah Wright and understand his influence on Barack Obama for the first time in a big, attention-arresting way,'' says the proposal, which was overseen by Fred Davis and commissioned by Joe Ricketts, the founder of the brokerage firm TD Ameritrade. Mr. Ricketts is increasingly putting his fortune to work in conservative politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $10 million plan, one of several being studied by Mr. Ricketts, includes preparations for how to respond to the charges of race-baiting it envisions if it highlights Mr. Obama's former ties to Mr. Wright, who espouses what is known as ''black liberation theology.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group suggested hiring as a spokesman an ''extremely literate conservative African-American'' who can argue that Mr. Obama misled the nation by presenting himself as what the proposal calls a ''metrosexual, black Abe Lincoln.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A copy of a detailed advertising plan was obtained by The New York Times through a person not connected to the proposal who was alarmed by its tone. It is titled ''The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal was presented last week in Chicago to associates and family members of Mr. Ricketts, who is also the patriarch of the family that owns the Chicago Cubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Baker, president and general counsel of a super PAC called the Ending Spending Action Fund, said Mr. Ricketts had studied several advertising proposals in recent months and had not signed off on a specific approach to taking on Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Joe Ricketts is prepared to spend significant resources in the 2012 election in both the presidential race and Congressional races,'' Mr. Baker said in an interview Wednesday. ''He is very concerned about the future direction of the country and plans to take a stand.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document makes clear that the effort is only in the planning stages and awaiting full approval from Mr. Ricketts. People involved in the planning said the publicity now certain to surround it could send the strategists back to the drawing board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it serves as a rare, detailed look at the birth of the sort of political sneak attack that has traditionally been hatched in the shadows and has become a staple of presidential politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also shows how a single individual can create his own movement and spend unlimited sums to have major influence on a presidential election in a campaign finance environment in which groups operating independently of candidates are flourishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should the plan proceed, it would run counter to the strategy being employed by Mitt Romney's team, which has so far avoided such attacks. The Romney campaign has sought to focus attention on the economy, and has concluded that personal attacks on Mr. Obama, who is still well liked personally by most independent voters surveyed for polls, could backfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ricketts has become an increasingly active player in Republican politics through several political action committees, including Ending Spending. He has a son, Pete, who is a member of the Republican National Committee from Nebraska and a daughter, Laura, who is a top contributor to Mr. Obama's re-election campaign. She has not been involved in her father's political efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 54-page proposal was professionally bound and illustrated with color photographs, indicating that it is far beyond a mere discussion. The strategists have already contacted Larry Elder, a black conservative radio host in Los Angeles, about serving as a spokesman, and the plan calls for a group of black business leaders to endorse the effort. The strategists have also registered a domain name, Character Matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal suggests that Mr. Ricketts believes the 2008 campaign of Senator John McCain erred in not using images of Mr. Wright against Mr. Obama, who has said that the pastor helped him find Jesus but that he was never present for Mr. Wright's politically charged sermons. Mr. Obama left the church during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently referring to a Wright ad that was produced for the McCain campaign by Mr. Davis's firm but never used, the proposal opens with a quote from Mr. Ricketts: ''If the nation had seen that ad, they'd never have elected Barack Obama.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planning document is emblazoned with the logo of Strategic Perception, the political advertising firm of Mr. Davis, the colorful Republican operative who last worked on the Republican presidential campaign of former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman of Utah. Included on his ''Recommended Team of Pirates'' are the former Huntsman pollster Whit Ayres and the McCain campaign Internet strategist Becki Donatelli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document, which was written by former advisers to Mr. McCain, is critical of his decision in 2008 not to aggressively pursue Mr. Obama's relationship with Mr. Wright. In the opening paragraphs of the proposal, the Republican strategists refer to Mr. McCain as ''a crusty old politician who often seemed confused, burdened with a campaign just as confused.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Our plan is to do exactly what John McCain would not let us do: Show the world how Barack Obama's opinions of America and the world were formed,'' the proposal says. ''And why the influence of that misguided mentor and our president's formative years among left-wing intellectuals has brought our country to its knees.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan is designed for maximum impact, far beyond a typical $10 million television advertising campaign. It calls for full-page newspaper advertisements featuring a comment Mr. Wright made the Sunday after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. ''America's chickens are coming home to roost,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan is for the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., to be ''jolted.'' The advertising campaign would include television ads, outdoor advertisements and huge aerial banners flying over the convention site for four hours one afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategists grappled with the quandary of running against Mr. Obama that other Republicans have cited this year: ''How to inflame their questions on his character and competency, while allowing themselves to still somewhat 'like' the man becomes the challenge.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamenting that voters ''still aren't ready to hate this president,'' the document concludes that the campaign should ''explain how forces out of Obama's control, that shaped the man, have made him completely the wrong choice as president in these days and times.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The contributions on behalf of Mitt Romney represent a huge jump over the $12.6 million that his campaign raised in March, an increase partly attributed to donors coalescing around Mr. Romney as the nominee. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney almost matched President Obama in fund-raising during April after securing his party's presidential nomination and joining forces with the Republican National Committee, the campaign will announce on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney and the R.N.C. raised $40.1 million in April, just shy of the $43.6 million that Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee raised for the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contributions on behalf of Mr. Romney represent a huge jump over the $12.6 million that his campaign raised in March. The increase was made possible by donors coalescing around Mr. Romney as the nominee and the larger donations that can be directed to the party, campaign officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters are tired of President Obama's broken promises,&quot; said Reince Priebus, the chairman of the R.N.C. in a statement. &quot;Mitt Romney has the record and plan to turn our country around - that is why he is receiving such enthusiastic support from voters across the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. Romney noted that the total might have been even higher if the joint fund-raising effort - known as  the &quot;Victory&quot; campaign - had begun sooner. The campaign and the R.N.C. announced they were joining forces on April 4 but did not hold the first combined event until April 14, nearly halfway through the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney had lost ground in the money wars to Mr. Obama during the first quarter of 2012 as he battled with his Republican rivals for the nomination. As of the end of March, Mr. Obama had 10 times the cash on hand as Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the surge in fund-raising for Mr. Romney may begin to even the scales, at least as far as the campaigns and their official party support is concerned. Democrats still fear that outside groups like &quot;super PACs&quot; and other organizations will tip the financial balance in Mr. Romney's favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement set to go out on Thursday morning, Mr. Romney's campaign will report a cash-on-hand total of $61.4 million as of the end of April. The campaign says that 95 percent of the donations in April were $250 or less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are pleased with the strong support we have received from Americans across the country who are looking for new leadership in the White House,&quot; said Spencer Zwick, Mr. Romney's finance chairman, in the statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign contributions will help finance an air war between the candidates that is already well under way. Mr. Obama has announced a $25 million television ad campaign for May aimed at boosting his record as president. And outside groups backing Mr. Romney have pledged millions more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Romney also has the challenge of catching up to Mr. Obama in staffing campaign offices around the country. Mr. Obama's Chicago-based campaign has spent months opening field offices and hiring staff while Mr. Romney fought for the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns have set ambitious goals for fund-raising. Mr. Romney's advisers have said he could raise as much as $800 million for his White House bid. Mr. Obama's campaign has said they might raise close to $750 million for the president.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:48 p.m. | Updated  Mitt Romney condemned efforts to use President Obama's former pastor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, in ads attacking the president, as reportedly planned by a &quot;super PAC&quot; working toward electing Mr. Romney in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I repudiate the effort by that PAC to promote an ad strategy of the nature they've described,&quot; Mr. Romney said during an interview with the conservative Townhall Web site. &quot;I would like to see this campaign focus on the economy, on getting people back to work, on seeing rising incomes and growing prosperity -- particularly for those in the middle class of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney used the opportunity to accuse Mr. Obama of running a &quot;campaign is a campaign of character assassination&quot; but said of the PAC that &quot;I repudiate what they're thinking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Mr. Romney's campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, said that &quot;Gov. Romney is running a campaign based on jobs and the economy, and we encourage everyone else to do the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times's Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg  Thursday morning on a plan by a group of Republican strategists to run ads linking Mr. Obama to his former pastor. A copy of the group's detailed advertising plan, obtained by The Times, suggests using Mr. Wright's &quot;black liberation&quot; rhetoric against the president, who attended Mr. Wright's church for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, a spokesman for Joe Ricketts, the billionaire to whom the super PAC proposal was made, said Mr. Ricketts had no interest in financing the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Ricketts is a registered independent, a fiscal conservative, and an outspoken critic of the Obama Administration, but he is neither the author nor the funder of the so-called &quot;Ricketts Plan&quot; to defeat Mr. Obama that The New York Times wrote about this morning,&quot; said Brian Baker, the president of the Ending Spending Action Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects and it was never a plan to be accepted but only a suggestion for a direction to take,&quot; Mr. Baker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mr. Romney's campaign confronts the story about the super PAC's plans, its response may be constrained by the forceful denunciation of that very tactic by the Republican Party's former presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Senator John McCain forbade his advisers from using Mr. Obama's association with Mr. Wright in campaign commercials. But his direction was not only made in private. Mr. McCain spoke forcefully - and publicly - in defense of his Democratic rival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on Fox News four years ago, Mr. McCain said that he did not believe Mr. Obama should be held accountable for the things that Mr. Wright said from the pulpit, despite Mr. Obama's attendance at the church for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When people support you, it doesn't mean that you support everything they say,&quot; Mr. McCain said in the interview. Noting the incendiary language that Mr. Wright used, Mr. McCain said: &quot;Obviously, those words and those statements are statements that none of us would associate ourselves with. I don't believe that Senator Obama would support any of those as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given repeated opportunities by Sean Hannity, the Fox host, to link Mr. Obama to Mr. Wright, Mr. McCain steadfastly defended his rival, saying &quot;I do know Senator Obama. He does not share those views.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the campaign, Mr. McCain again said he did not believe that Mr. Obama shared Mr. Wright's views about America, though he said Mr. Obama had acknowledged the issue was a legitimate one for people to consider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe that Senator Obama shares his views in any way,&quot; Mr. McCain said. &quot;But he has said it's a legitimate topic of discussion. If that's what the American people want to discuss, that's fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statements like that from Mr. McCain may be part of the reason Mr. Romney's campaign quickly rejected the idea of using Mr. Wright as a way of attacking the president. Already, advisers to Mr. Obama have raised the question of whether Mr. Romney will speak out like Mr. McCain did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stunning! Will Mitt stand up, as John McCaln did? Or allow the purveyors of slime to operate on his behalf?&quot; David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser to Mr. Obama, wrote on Twitter early Thursday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign may also fear shifting the conversation of the campaign away from the economy, where advisers believe the president has a weak and indefensible record. Mr. Romney has, for example, shied away from discussing the same-sex marriage issue, preferring to keep his attention focused on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney declined to answer a question about the report when asked about it, saying he had not  read the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement Mr. Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, slammed the super PAC's plans and criticized Mr. Romney for not publicly condemning the effort in person. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning's story revealed the appalling lengths to which Republican operatives and SuperPacs apparently are willing to go to tear down the President and elect Mitt Romney,&quot; Mr. Messina wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;It also reflects how far the party has drifted in four short years since John McCain rejected these very tactics.  Once again, Governor Romney has fallen short of the standard that John McCain set, reacting tepidly in a moment that required moral leadership in standing up to the very extreme wing of his own party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, in a statement provided to The Times by his spokesman, said he stands by his opposition to using Mr. Wright against the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain is very proud of the campaign he ran in 2008,&quot; said Brian Rogers, the spokesman. &quot;He stands by the decisions he made during that race and would make them again today.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Senator John McCain of Arizona repudiated a proposal by Republican strategists to &quot;do exactly what John McCain would not let us do,&quot; launch an incendiary, racially-tinged attack on the president. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator John McCain, who refused to make President Obama's association with the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright an issue during his 2008 presidential campaign, repudiated a proposal by Republican strategists to &quot;do exactly what John McCain would not let us do&quot; -- open an incendiary, racially tinged attack on the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain also shrugged off the slights against him in a proposal for the political ad campaign, which was brought to light by The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know whether to be offended or not,&quot; Mr. McCain said with a smile. &quot;It is what it is. Look, my life has moved on.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that such third-party attacks are &quot;a way for political operatives to continue to make money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authors of the ad campaign, timed to rock the Democratic National Convention in September, asserted that &quot;if the nation had seen that ad, they'd never have elected Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed ad opened with a series of jabs against Mr. McCain, whose campaign was portrayed as punchless and befuddled. Written by former McCain campaign advisers, the ad's opening paragraphs refer to him as &quot;a crusty old politician who often seemed confused, burdened with a campaign just as confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">              Speaking to reporters at the Capitol,   Mr. McCain appeared untroubled Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                &quot;I remain proud of our campaign and proud of what we were able to accomplish, and I would do it over again,&quot; he said. &quot;I noticed that the Romney campaign quickly issued a statement saying they repudiated that strategy as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                The strategists' memo and detailed advertisement proposal was the talk of Capitol Hill. Speaker John A. Boehner, reflecting the campaign of the presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney, tried to keep the political focus on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                &quot;This campaign is going to be about the economy, is going to be about jobs, as it should be,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The politics of the proposed ad were also repudiated on Thursday by the man who commissioned it, Joe Ricketts, the founder of the brokerage firm TD Ameritrade and patriarch of the family that owns the Chicago Cubs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, the House minority leader, was more voluble. She said friends of hers had told her they were renouncing their allegiance to the Cubs and shifting to Chicago's South Side team, the White Sox - Mr. Obama's team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                &quot;I hope they're as successful with this campaign as the Cubs are with baseball,&quot; Ms. Pelosi jabbed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">732 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Attacking the president by dredging up the Jeremiah Wright controversy is bad political strategy. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fred Davis is a lousy political strategist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's my takeaway from today's Times story on how Mr. Davis, a high-profile Republican consultant, is working with Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade, &quot;on a proposal to mount one of the most provocative campaigns of the 'super PAC' era&quot;-namely commercials &quot;linking Mr. Obama to incendiary comments by his former spiritual adviser, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt that the proposal, titled &quot; The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good,&quot; is &quot;provocative,&quot; as the Times story put it. (Note the use of the president's middle name. Nudge, nudge. Think of Saddam Hussein. Nudge, nudge. He must be a Muslim.)<BR><BR>But after reading the &quot;storyboard&quot; for the ad, I'm amazed that anyone would actually think it could hurt the president's re-election chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed ad spins off Mr. Wright's comments from many years ago, including his infamous &quot;God Damn America&quot; remark. &quot;Week after week, year after year, he heard the hatred,&quot; the script reads. &quot;He was taught for years that America WAS the problem, so how could he ever believe it could be the solution?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The week after week bit is not true. It's not even clear that Mr. Obama heard the &quot;God damn&quot; remark. But, regardless, the Wright connection was barely relevant four years ago. It's completely irrelevant now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The middle of the attack ad is a diatribe against Mr. Obama's economic policies - the stimulus was a failure, along with the health reform law; he added more to the national debt than any previous president; and he's done nothing to boost job growth. Sound familiar? It should, because these distortions feature in pretty much every other anti-Obama&nbsp;ad that's already run or is in the works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only thing the Davis spot adds to previous attacks is the race angle. And lest readers think I'm crazy to see a racist aspect to the proposal-his team was well aware that they'd be charged with race-baiting. According to the Times story, the group even &quot;suggested hiring as a spokesman an 'extremely literate African-American' who can argue that Mr. Obama misled the nation by presenting himself as a 'metrosexual, black Abe Lincoln.'&quot; I know I'm not the only one who thinks a metrosexual, black Abe Lincoln sounds awesome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain rejected this tactic in 2008: He refused to run an ad tarring Mr. Obama by association. Perhaps because he knew it would backfire. But the Davis team thinks that's why he lost. &quot;Our plan is to do exactly what John McCain would not let us do: Show the world how Barack Obama's opinions of America and the world were formed,&quot; the proposal says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess there were people in 2008 who thought Mr. Obama's membership in Mr. Wright's congregation meant he was some kind of sleeper agent bent on destroying America. But the only voters who could possibly believe that now are fringe right-wingers who would never support Mr. Obama, anyway. If Mr. Obama wanted to destroy America, wouldn't he have done that already?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed ad plays right into the liberal conviction that racial paranoia motivates much of the aggressive opposition to Mr. Obama. It might even be just the thing to fire up a liberal base that has been a bit slow in rallying around the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I was writing this post, Mitt Romney condemned the proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I repudiate the effort by that PAC to promote an ad strategy of the nature they've described,&quot; Mr. Romney said during an interview with the conservative Townhall Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But let's not forget that, in February, he told Sean Hannity &quot;I'm not sure which is worse, him listening to Reverend Wright or him saying that we must be a less than Christian nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ricketts also distanced himself from the proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of his super PAC, Brian Baker, said in a statement: &quot;Not only was this plan merely a proposal - one of several submitted to the Ending Spending Action fund by third party vendors, but it reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have to wonder why Mr. Baker didn't explain that to the reporters who interviewed him Wednesday evening, before the PAC got a half-day's free publicity for the sort of &quot;approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;First as a community organizer, then as a president. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the Obama campaign's attempted pivot from the social issues to Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital, it's worth highlighting this point from&nbsp;David Frum:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: suppose you watch&nbsp;the Bain video&nbsp;and are horrified by the practices of private equity. You want to cast a vote to ensure that such practices are stamped out. Whom should you vote for? Answer: flip a coin. There is nothing in the Obama platform that will in any way protect workers from future depredations by future private equity investors. (And in fact, the actual Romney did much of his depredating under the last Democratic administration.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bain attack ad is pure expressive/symbolic politics: vote Obama because Romney is a bad guy, not because an Obama administration will make any practical difference to people like those featured in the video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama wants credit for being more caring, compassionate, and concerned than Romney. But even if that were all true (and I'm not at all sure it is)-so what? It's not like he has in mind any plan or policy actually to do anything very different from his rival on this score, other perhaps than provide somewhat more generous federal benefits after the plant is closed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In point of fact, as&nbsp;Reihan Salam pointed out&nbsp;yesterday, the president actually has some firsthand experience of the difficulty involved in helping laid-off steelworkers find new manufacturing work, since his early days as a community organizer were spent trying to do exactly that. Salam quotes from&nbsp;Byron York's 2008 National Review piece, which went in-depth on Obama's community-organizing past:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... The long-term goal was to retrain workers in order to restore manufacturing jobs in the area; Kellman took Obama by the rusted-out, closed-down Wisconsin Steel plant for a firsthand look. But the whole thing was a bit of a pipe dream, as the leaders soon discovered. &quot;The idea was to interview these people and look at education, transferable skills, so that we could refer them to other industries,&quot; Loretta Augustine-Herron told me as we drove by the site of the old factory, now completely torn down. &quot;Well, they had no transferable skills. I remember interviewing one man who ran a steel-straightening machine. It straightened steel bars or something. I said, well, what did you do? And he told me he pushed a button, and the rods came in, and he pushed a button and it straightened them, and he pushed a button and it sent them somewhere else. That's all he did. And he made big bucks doing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, of course, was one of the reasons the steel mill closed. And it became clear that neither Obama nor Kellman nor anyone else was going to change the direction of the steel industry and its unions in the United States. Somewhere along the line, everyone realized that those jobs wouldn't be coming back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Obama looked for new opportunities ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just because neither community organizer Obama nor President Obama has found a way to undo the economic consequences of globalization doesn't mean that the White House can't claim its policies will &quot;make any practical difference to people like those featured in the video.&quot; They can so claim, for reasons suggested by Frum's last line: Because they&nbsp;&nbsp;promising more generous federal benefits than fiscal conservatives, whether through unemployment insurance or Obamacare or ultimately through Social Security or Medicare. This is why I keep coming back to the idea that Mediscare tactics are the only plausible centerpiece - should the recovery keep limping, at least -&nbsp;for a successful Obama re-election campaign: They're the place where economic attacks on Romney and the Republicans cease being expressive and symbolic (and thus insufficient to overcome the grim unemployment numbers) and become something that might actually hit home.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mitt Romney's usual bullet-point-laden stump speech was punctuated by a series of playful, impromptu moments in Jacksonville, Fla. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- It was Mitt Romney unplugged -- or as unplugged as he gets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidate's usually buttoned-up and bullet-point-laden stump speech here on Thursday afternoon was punctuated by a series of playful, impromptu moments as Mr. Romney reacted to a driving rain, contemplated someday moving to Florida and stopped his speech to retrieve a campaign check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he was about to begin his speech, Mr. Romney noticed that a group of about a dozen people sitting at the edge of a giant tent were exposed to a sudden storm. He quickly morphed into crowd coordinator, instructing the audience, step by step, how to make way for the wet supporters, whom he invited onstage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, they immediately blocked a carefully constructed political prop -- a national debt clock. Mr. Romney didn't seem to care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He apologized for his wife Ann's absence, then announced that the couple has discussed the idea of eventually relocating to the sunshine state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She has said, 'Someday who knows, we might move to Florida,' &quot; Mr. Romney said, to loud applause. &quot;You never know. Someday, way down the road.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most unexpected moment occurred when a woman in the audience motioned to a friend, saying that she had a check to give Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman, Joyce Stokes, waved the check at Mr. Romney, who was talking about &quot;vertical drilling&quot; of oil wells. Mr. Romney paused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a check,&quot; he said, with a start. &quot;We'll get that in a second.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, he deadpanned: &quot;Happens to me every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, clearly playing for the crowd, motioned to a staff member. &quot;Hey Garrett, Garrett! Go get her check will you? Thank you. Oh -- and get out of the rain, Garrett.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney smiled, then surveyed the crowd for other potential donors. &quot;Anybody else?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DES MOINES -- As he campaigned in Iowa on Tuesday, Mitt Romney used a ''prairie fire'' metaphor to describe the nation's debt and its impact on the sagging economic fortunes of many Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that fire burns less intensely across Iowa, a swing state with one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. A booming farm economy has enriched many people in this largely agricultural state. And the housing crisis felt keenly elsewhere has largely passed it by. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That makes Iowa -- an electoral prize coveted by both presidential campaigns this November -- an important laboratory for Mr. Romney's broad effort to lay the blame for the nation's continuing economic distress at President Obama's feet. Mr. Romney hopes to snag the state back for Republicans after Mr. Obama flipped it to the Democratic column in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's top campaign advisers are betting that voters in Iowa -- and in other places where the economy is beginning to turn around -- will look beyond their state's 5.2 percent unemployment rate and focus instead on the jobs slump nationwide, where unemployment still hovers above 8 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Jobs and the economy still resonate with everybody, regardless of whether their own state is doing well,'' Rich Beeson, the political director for Mr. Romney, said in an interview. ''If it was something that President Obama was doing, it would be working all over the country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Mr. Romney presses hard to win the state's six electoral votes, he faces other challenges as well: a disciplined and longstanding Obama campaign operation, an evangelical community that continues to view Mr. Romney warily, and a state party that has recently been taken over by supporters of Ron Paul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Romney finished second to Rick Santorum, and won just 14 percent of the vote among those who said they were born-again or evangelical Christians. These voters demonstrated a nervousness about Mr. Romney during the Republican primaries, repeatedly voting for his rivals in state after state. Mr. Romney's advisers believe those divisions will fade in the general election. If so, Iowa could be one place where it happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the reconciliation will take time and effort, according to Steve Scheffler, the president of the Iowa Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition. Mr. Scheffler said Mr. Romney's campaign had recently reached out to him, but needs to do more, quickly, like hiring campaign workers to attract voters who care about abortion, traditional marriage and gun rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They are just now beginning to get their game together,'' Mr. Scheffler said. ''Hopefully, they are going to make an outreach to conservative Christians. Hopefully, they are beginning to realize they need to involve all parts of the Republican Party.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Mr. Romney faces an unexpected political annoyance. A backer of Mr. Paul is now the state party chairman. And supporters of Mr. Paul and his libertarian movement now make up nearly half of the state's 18-member central committee, having ousted some of the state's establishment Republicans who had backed Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It has to be of considerable concern,'' said Steve Roberts, a longtime Iowa Republican who served as one of the state's national committeemen for a decade. ''You need everybody to work together and be unified and turn out the vote and get every last vote for Romney if he's going to win.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. Romney dismiss the political coup, saying that they are confident the party will be united behind the Republican in the fall. But Mr. Paul's chief strategist, Jesse Benton, made clear in an e-mail to supporters on Tuesday that Mr. Paul intends to keep fighting for his beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''By sending a large, respectful, and professional delegation to Tampa, we will show the party and the country that not only is our movement growing and here to stay, but that the future belongs to us,'' Mr. Benton wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans say they are optimistic about Mr. Romney's chances in Iowa. Unlike Senator John McCain of Arizona, who did not campaign hard in the state, campaign aides say Mr. Romney will fight hard for votes here. On Tuesday, his campaign released a Web video intended to highlight the stories of unemployed Iowans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I've been looking for a job for two years,'' Deborah Ragland of Webster City, Iowa, says in the video. ''Haven't found any. My unemployment benefits did run out, and we're just trying to get by.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And voters who listened to Mr. Romney speak on Tuesday said his emphasis on the federal debt accumulated under Mr. Obama resonated with them. Several pointed to the federal bailout of big banks, which had begun under President George W. Bush, and the stimulus package, carried out under Mr. Obama, as examples of what they said was excessive government spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Zietlow, an insurance agent, said he feared that the United States ''is going to be like European countries if we don't get our spending under control.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president, he said, ''believes you can continue to fund every program,'' whereas Mr. Romney is the cold-eyed, number-crunching businessman, who knows when to salvage something or let it die. ''You need to know the difference,'' Mr. Zietlow said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Urbanek, 63, a commercial real estate broker, said the thought that his two grandchildren would be left with the federal debt weighed heavily on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president ''has not demonstrated any ability to reduce the deficit. He only knows how to grow it,'' Mr. Urbanek said. ''He's never had a real job. It's play money to him.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A new ad from Crossroads GPS says the president broke his promise to cut the deficit. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's not much truth in the big new anti-Obama ad campaign from Crossroads GPS, but since the public doesn't know who paid for it, no one can be held responsible for the misleading content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crossroads GPS, which was founded by Karl Rove, plans to spend hundreds of millions to elect Republicans to the White House and Congress this year. A so-called non-profit social welfare group, it can raise unlimited amounts from corporations and individuals without identifying them. The donors, of course, will make sure that Mitt Romney knows they contributed generously.<BR><BR>Given the nature of this particular $25 million campaign, going up in several battleground states on Thursday, it's understandable why the sponsors might prefer to remain anonymous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president, says the ad, promised to help millions of homeowners facing foreclosure. &quot;Promise broken,&quot; the announcer says. &quot;One in five mortgages are still under water.&quot; In fact, mortgage delinquencies recently hit a four-year low. President Obama has come up with a strong proposal to help homeowners refinance, but it would be paid for with a bank tax that Republicans have opposed. And Mr. Romney's solution to the foreclosure problem? &quot;Let it run its course and hit the bottom,&quot; he said. No need for any government help here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's promise that no family making less than $250,000 would see a tax increase? &quot;Broken. Obamacare raises 18 different taxes.&quot; It doesn't explain that the biggest of those increases, which applies the Medicare payroll tax to investment income, only affects those with family incomes of greater than $250,000, as promised. The other increases are on things like tanning salons or medical devices, which affect very few people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And finally, the ad excoriates Mr. Obama for failing to cut the deficit in half, as he promised to do. &quot;He hasn't even come close.&quot; It never mentions that every one of the president's budget proposals have been shot down by Republicans for daring to raise revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad invites viewers to a Web site called newmajorityagenda.org, which redirects them to the Crossroads GPS site and a standard list of Republican policy proposals. Poke around on the site and you'll eventually find one of the year's most important Republican policies: &quot;Crossroads GPS's policy is to not provide the names of its donors to the general public.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Bush and Bill Clinton got together again Tuesday night to promote their latest shared post-presidential cause, a memorial to the heroes of United Flight 93. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The odd-bedfellows tandem of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton got together again Tuesday night to promote their latest shared post-presidential cause, a memorial to the heroes of United Flight 93.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The 42nd and 43rd presidents headlined a fund-raiser at the Newseum in Washington in hopes of bringing in enough money to honor the passengers who confronted hijackers and brought down their plane on Sept. 11, 2001, rather than let it be crashed into the nation's capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;It's important to always honor courage and I think the acts of those on 93 will go down as one of the most courageous acts in the history of the United States,&quot; said Mr. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The two former presidents have picked up where they off, promoting nonpartisan ventures in a partisan era. Their most prominent collaboration was the relief effort for Haiti after the earthquake of January 2010, but they have also given speeches or participated in question-and-answer sessions together, and refer to each other jokingly as lost brothers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Neither has given up his party affiliation, of course. Mr. Clinton appeared with President Obama at a Democratic fund-raiser last month and Mr. Bush informally endorsed the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, earlier in the day. But the two have kept up the bipartisan tradition of occasionally putting aside politics after the White House, as documented in &quot;The Presidents Club,&quot; a new book by Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy of Time magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The Flight 93 National Memorial was a natural cause for the two presidents, one that harkens back to the day when Americans joined together despite differences over politics or backgrounds. The actions of the Flight 93 passengers who stormed the cockpit to take on the Qaeda terrorists who had seized their plane proved an inspiring rallying point for a stunned nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While September 11 memorials in New York and Virginia have been fully financed, officials said, the one in Shanksville, Pa., where the passenger jet went down, remains short of its target. Of $76 million needed for the project, $30 million has been raised from private sources and $32 million from government financing, according to Marjorie Hall, communications director for the National Park Foundation, the Congressionally chartered organization that supports the National Park Service. Another $4 million is expected from taxpayers and the presidents are aiming to find the remaining $10 million from private donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The first phase of a memorial plaza on the 2,200-acre site was dedicated last September but plans remain for a visitors center, a learning center and a 93-foot-tall &quot;tower of voices&quot; containing 40 aluminum wind chimes, one for every person slain aboard Flight 93, not counting the hijackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   About 350 guests joined the two presidents at the Newseum event along with Laura Bush, Speaker John A. Boehner and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. David Gregory, the host of NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; moderated the event.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;President Obama and the Democrats raised $43.6 million in April, adding to the president's edge over his rival, Mitt Romney, even as money continues to pour in to outside groups ahead of the fall campaign. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama and the Democrats raised $43.6 million in April, adding to the president's edge over his rival, Mitt Romney, even as money continues to pour in to outside groups ahead of the fall campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $43.6 million is a dip from March, when Mr. Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee raised a combined $53 million. But it does not count several large fund-raisers - includingone in Hollywood that reportedly raised $15 million - that took place in early May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign is also hoping to capitalize in the months ahead on increased fund-raising in the gay community after Mr. Obama's statement this month that he supports same-sex marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a video released Wednesday morning, Jim Messina, the president's campaign manager, focused on the need to compete with the outside groups like Crossroads GPS and Restore Our Future, a &quot;super PAC&quot; formed to help Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oil company executives and other special interests are dumping millions of dollars in super PAC attack ads,&quot; Mr. Messina said. &quot;The Koch bothers-funded super PAC spent $6 million on TV ads attacking the president. Mitt Romney's super PAC put another $4 million on the air.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign is eager to light a fire under its supporters to donate money to combat those ads. But it's also trying to show potential donors how contributions are being used to build an effective organization on the ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the video, Mr. Messina described how the campaign has opened dozens of field offices in swing states like Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia in the hopes of overwhelming Mr. Romney with a superior organization. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the campaign knows that the ability to compete with Mr. Romney and the outside groups with television advertising will be a key to winning the election. And that takes money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just this month, Mr. Obama's campaign announced a $25 million advertising buy in the battleground states in a largely positive effort to promote the president's accomplishments in office. And on Wednesday, the campaign is paying for a two-minute attack ad about Mr. Romney's time at Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Mr. Obama has easily outpaced Mr. Romney's fund-raising. By mid-March, Mr. Obama's campaign had amassed nearly 10 times the amount of cash on hand that Mr. Romney had collected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that was just as Mr. Romney was wrapping up the nomination. The Republican candidate has plans to raise as much as $800 million to spend on the general election, and has increased his fund-raising since becoming the presumptive nominee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The presidential advertising wars have begun in earnest, with the latest salvo - &amp;#160;a $25 million attack on President Obama by a Karl Rove-backed political group - &amp;#160;set to begin on Thursday. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential advertising wars have begun in earnest, with the latest salvo - &nbsp;a $25 million attack on President Obama by a Karl Rove-backed political group - &nbsp;set to begin on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad campaign by Crossroads GPS fills a Republican void on the airwaves in several battleground states, like Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia, which have so far been dominated by ads from the president and his supporters. Mr. Obama announced a $25 million advertising barrage of his own last week, starting with a series of commercials that heralded the president's efforts to help revive the economy. And the pro-Obama &quot;super PAC,&quot; Priorities Action USA, began a campaign on Tuesday that attacked Mitt Romney's record as a private equity chief executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first ad in the Crossroads campaign is a&nbsp;60-second spot&nbsp;that casts the president's first three years in office as a disappointment. &quot;President Obama's agenda promised so much,&quot; it says. &quot;We need solutions, not just promises.&quot; Crossroads said it was putting $8 million behind the ad, which will run through the end of the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama made commitments on core issues to the American people, and this ad holds him to account,&quot; said Steven Law, president of Crossroads GPS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the leading outside conservative advocacy groups, Crossroads and its sister organization, American Crossroads, plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in this election, much of it attacking the president's record. Along with groups like Americans for Prosperity, founded with backing from the Koch brothers, these organizations have been at work since the 2010 midterm elections with aggressive advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sheer volume of negative ads already directed at the president is something the Obama campaign is trying to turn to its political advantage. The super PACs - in the aggregate sense - have become just as much an opponent in the eyes of the president's advisers as Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's Chicago-based campaign team has been waiting months to launch a real attack against Mitt Romney's experience at Bain Capital. Even before Romney's Republican presidential rivals started going after him, Obama's campaign was preparing for the moment that arrived this week.          There is no mystery to the strategy underway: define Romney before he can fully pivot to general-election voters after a nomination battle that went on longer than expected and that kept the presumptive GOP nominee pinned to the right of the political spectrum as he fought off more conservative challengers.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama advisers in Chicago and the West Wing believe that attacks on Romney's record in both private business and state government could disqualify the former Massachusetts governor in the eyes of voters. Although the initial Obama campaign ad will run in just a few markets in a few states, an Obama-backed super PAC will amplify the message with its own advertisement on the same theme. No doubt there is much more coming from both. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Boston, Romney advisers believe they see a bit of panic in their rival's moves. They believe the softness of the economy, the slow pace of job creation, and the pain still felt by the unemployed and the underemployed imperil Obama's chances for reelection - a view shared by analysts not attached to Romney's campaign. They further believe that the political cognoscenti undervalue Romney as a candidate and therefore his chances of winning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The engagement has brought the campaign quickly back to the core issue before the voters: the state of an economy that, although no longer in recession, is still not healthy.  Same-sex marriage dominated the political world last week, but the attack-counterattack on the economy this week will begin to set the real terms of the debate for November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Romney's Republican opponents went after Bain and the role of private equity in buying and selling businesses and, in the process, sometimes laying off workers and downsizing operations, there was an outcry from within the party: Don't attack the free-enterprise system. Romney complained that his rivals, principally former House speaker Newt Gingrich, were trying to penalize success. He said he would not apologize for having been good at what he did.The reaction from the party was enough to force Gingrich and his super PAC to back off and look for other avenues of attack against Romney. The Obama campaign will be immune to such rejoinders and won't face the kind of internal pressure from the left to tone down its criticism. Obama's progressive base has been eager to portray Romney as someone whose values skew to the rich at the expense of the middle class. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign has had many months to test various arguments with voters in focus groups to see which resonate. The fruits of that work are now being seen. Some of the president's advisers believe that, although Romney might be less gaffe-prone as a general-election candidate than he was in the primaries, he still can be portrayed as a politician disconnected from the problems of average Americans in ways that could cripple his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What gives me confidence [about the election] is the notion that he's just out of touch, [that] he just doesn't get it, will be a constant problem for him. . . . His whole focus was on maximizing profit as opposed to the middle class,&quot; said one Obama adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid about how the president's campaign sees the debate unfolding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, Obama has argued that Republicans and Romney want to take the country back to the policies that led to the economic collapse in 2008. There will be more debates about whether either candidate has a real plan for the future, as well as about Romney's job-creation record vs. Obama's. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is not what this is about. Obama's campaign has taken a page from the 2004 reelection campaign of President George W. Bush. Shortly after Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.), the Democratic nominee, wrapped up his nomination, the Bush team went on television with positive ads about the president. But quickly thereafter, the campaign turned its fire on Kerry and never let up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's opening volley is less an assault on private equity than it is an attack on the character of the former governor. It goes directly to the issue of whose side Romney is on, where the Obama campaign sees the GOP candidate as most vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has countered immediately, as he must. His advisers have argued that the election will not be won on style points or on the issue of which candidate is the more likeable. But they know he must be perceived as better equipped to accelerate the pace of recovery and boost the fortunes of the middle class. That might be all the more urgent if a new USA Today-Gallup poll showing rising optimism about the future economy continues to reflect public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to Obama, Romney's campaign produced a spot touting Bain's success in turning around companies and creating jobs. On Tuesday morning, the team issued a new video portraying the hardship and struggle of Iowans whose lives have been ravaged by the economy - timed no doubt to Romney's appearance in Des Moines, but with a message that they think will resonate elsewhere: Hope and change have not been kind to the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These responses do not directly answer the question of whose side the former governor is on - or would be if he were president. Instead they point voters back to the state of the country after three years of the Obama presidency. That makes this something of an asymmetrical debate - but one of vital importance in determining the outcome of the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides know that most Americans have a relatively fixed impression of the president, but that far fewer know much about Romney. This might seem like the early stages of the general election, but the two sides also know that what voters conclude about Romney in the next few months is likely to stick. That is what is behind the intensity of the engagement this week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, we read that women like Barack best (except when they don't). This week, a New York Times/CBS News poll shows women tilting toward Mitt and voters overall favoring him by 46 percent to 43 percent. But you know how girls are.

The concept of likability isn't new, but this election provides fresh criteria.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we focus instead on which guy we like, based on instincts that were honed in - you got it - high school. Almost daily, we hear that Mitt Romney isn't (or wasn't always) such a sweet guy.

This report followed by a single day the president's declaration of support for same-sex marriage. The comparison was grim for Romney, even if his bad behavior occurred five decades ago and despite his having no apparent animus toward the gay community.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          The fact that Romney claims not to remember the hair-cutting incident is a curiosity to many, but not to all. These differences of opinion will continue mostly as a Rorschach based on one's own experiences as a high school student. For now, we leave such discussions to our inner voices in order to save a little space for the point of this column, which is that the Obama campaign seems dedicated to advancing the notion that Obama is the nicer guy and therefore should be reelected. Polling supports this premise for now - with Obama twice as likable as Romney. The question is whether likability is enough, given that polling also shows that four in 10 voters think Obama's policies will make their financial situations worse if he is reelected.          A case can be made that a campaign that focuses on likability is a campaign that doesn't want to run on its record. A case also can be made that voters can be swayed by feel-good fare, given the complexity of our problems. Thus, Obama has taken pains to demonstrate just how wonderful he really is - one demographic at a time. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Here's Obama on the cover of Newsweek being promoted as the first gay president. This may help him with his base, but polls show that the broader voting audience isn't strongly swayed one way or the other.

Finally, here's an Obama&nbsp;ad characterizing Romney as a &quot;vampire&quot; who, while head of Bain Capital, sometimes profited from failed businesses that also sometimes resulted in job losses. This is otherwise known as capitalism, but never mind. For likability, see auto bailout. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This last example is at least of a more substantive nature, suggesting a real debate about different approaches to the marketplace.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's Chicago-based campaign team has been waiting months to launch a real attack against Mitt Romney's experience at Bain Capital. Even before Romney's Republican presidential rivals started going after him, Obama's campaign was preparing for the moment that arrived this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no mystery to the strategy underway: define Romney before he can fully pivot to general-election voters after a nomination battle that went on longer than expected and that kept the presumptive GOP nominee pinned to the right of the political spectrum as he fought off more conservative challengers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama advisers in Chicago and the West Wing believe that attacks on Romney's record in both private business and state government could disqualify the former Massachusetts governor in the eyes of voters. Although the initial Obama campaign ad will run in just a few markets in a few states, an Obama-backed super PAC will amplify the message with its own advertisement on the same theme. No doubt there is much more coming from both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Boston, Romney advisers believe they see a bit of panic in their rival's moves. They believe the softness of the economy, the slow pace of job creation, and the pain still felt by the unemployed and the underemployed imperil Obama's chances for reelection - a view shared by analysts not attached to Romney's campaign. They further believe that the political cognoscenti undervalue Romney as a candidate and therefore his chances of winning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The engagement has brought the campaign quickly back to the core issue before the voters: the state of an economy that, although no longer in recession, is still not healthy.  Same-sex marriage dominated the political world last week, but the attack-counterattack on the economy this week will begin to set the real terms of the debate for November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Romney's Republican opponents went after Bain and the role of private equity in buying and selling businesses and, in the process, sometimes laying off workers and downsizing operations, there was an outcry from within the party: Don't attack the free-enterprise system. Romney complained that his rivals, principally former House speaker Newt Gingrich, were trying to penalize success. He said he would not apologize for having been good at what he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reaction from the party was enough to force Gingrich and his super PAC to back off and look for other avenues of attack against Romney. The Obama campaign will be immune to such rejoinders and won't face the kind of internal pressure from the left to tone down its criticism. Obama's progressive base has been eager to portray Romney as someone whose values skew to the rich at the expense of the middle class. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign has had many months to test various arguments with voters in focus groups to see which resonate. The fruits of that work are now being seen. Some of the president's advisers believe that, although Romney might be less gaffe-prone as a general-election candidate than he was in the primaries, he still can be portrayed as a politician disconnected from the problems of average Americans in ways that could cripple his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What gives me confidence [about the election] is the notion that he's just out of touch, [that] he just doesn't get it, will be a constant problem for him. . . . His whole focus was on maximizing profit as opposed to the middle class,&quot; said one Obama adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid about how the president's campaign sees the debate unfolding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, Obama has argued that Republicans and Romney want to take the country back to the policies that led to the economic collapse in 2008. There will be more debates about whether either candidate has a real plan for the future, as well as about Romney's job-creation record vs. Obama's. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is not what this is about. Obama's campaign has taken a page from the 2004 reelection campaign of President George W. Bush. Shortly after Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.), the Democratic nominee, wrapped up his nomination, the Bush team went on television with positive ads about the president. But quickly thereafter, the campaign turned its fire on Kerry and never let up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's opening volley is less an assault on private equity than it is an attack on the character of the former governor. It goes directly to the issue of whose side Romney is on, where the Obama campaign sees the GOP candidate as most vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has countered immediately, as he must. His advisers have argued that the election will not be won on style points or on the issue of which candidate is the more likeable. But they know he must be perceived as better equipped to accelerate the pace of recovery and boost the fortunes of the middle class. That might be all the more urgent if a new USA Today-Gallup poll showing rising optimism about the future economy continues to reflect public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to Obama, Romney's campaign produced a spot touting Bain's success in turning around companies and creating jobs. On Tuesday morning, the team issued a new video portraying the hardship and struggle of Iowans whose lives have been ravaged by the economy - timed no doubt to Romney's appearance in Des Moines, but with a message that they think will resonate elsewhere: Hope and change have not been kind to the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These responses do not directly answer the question of whose side the former governor is on - or would be if he were president. Instead they point voters back to the state of the country after three years of the Obama presidency. That makes this something of an asymmetrical debate - but one of vital importance in determining the outcome of the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides know that most Americans have a relatively fixed impression of the president, but that far fewer know much about Romney. This might seem like the early stages of the general election, but the two sides also know that what voters conclude about Romney in the next few months is likely to stick. That is what is behind the intensity of the engagement this week.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama, shifting the focus from his recent endorsement of same-sex marriage to what he portrays as a lifelong belief in the essential role of women, told female graduates of Barnard College in New York City on Monday that they should go out and ''fight for a seat at the head of the table.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech that promoted his record on women's issues and drew a not-so-subtle distinction with the views of Republicans, including his presumptive challenger, Mitt Romney, Mr. Obama urged members of the class of nearly 600 to climb to the top of the corporate ladder or run for public office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dearth of female lawmakers in Congress, the president declared, was ''one reason we're actually refighting long-settled battles over women's rights.'' The shortage of female chief executives at major companies, he said, was ''one reason many workplaces still have outdated policies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's up to you to hold the system accountable and sometimes upend it entirely,'' Mr. Obama said to a friendly audience on the Morningside Heights campus of Columbia University. ''It's up to you to stand up and be heard, to write, and to lobby, to march, to organize, to vote. Don't be content just to sit back and watch.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's remarks came on a hectic day in New York, where he attended two fund-raisers and offered his first public response to the mammoth trading losses suffered by JPMorgan Chase, which has renewed demands for stricter regulation of Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''JPMorgan is one of the best managed banks there is,'' he said while taping an interview on the ABC program ''The View'' to be broadcast Tuesday. ''Jamie Dimon, the head of it, is one of the smartest bankers we got, and they still lost $2 billion and counting. We don't know all the details. It's going to be investigated, but this is why we passed Wall Street reform.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You could have a bank that isn't as strong, isn't as profitable managing those same bets and we might have had to step in,'' Mr. Obama added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Barnard, the president referred only obliquely to Wall Street, saying, ''Some folks in the financial world have not exactly been model corporate citizens.'' Instead, he kept the focus squarely on women's issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Squabbles over federal financing of Planned Parenthood and coverage of contraceptive services have emboldened Democrats who believe they can exploit a gender gap in the November election. Mr. Obama tried to leap into that gap on Monday, with a speech that drew heavily on his childhood, reared by a single mother and an ambitious but frustrated grandmother; his marriage to a strong-willed professional woman; his high hopes for his two daughters; even his cabinet, filled with accomplished women, from Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, after assuring the crowd that ''all of you will help lead the way,'' Mr. Obama cheerfully acknowledged he was pandering. ''I recognize that's a cheap applause line when you're giving a commencement at Barnard,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of Mr. Obama's address offered the bromides common to such speeches. At times, he recited standard policy messages on health care, education and alternative energy sources. At other times, he mixed fatherly advice with thoughts of his own daughters and reminiscences of his younger days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the timing gave it an unmistakable political subtext. Hours before Mr. Obama spoke, the Romney campaign and the Republican National Committee circulated reminders via Twitter and e-mail about how tough the job market has been for college graduates in the past few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the last several months, Democrats have tried to leverage women's issues against Republicans, attacking them for targeting Planned Parenthood, for resisting Mr. Obama's contraception mandate, and over the Paycheck Fairness Act, which Senate Republicans have rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest skirmish, the parties are battling over competing versions of the Violence Against Women Act, a measure that usually sails through Congress without controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican-controlled House this week is set to vote on a basic extension of the act, which aids local law enforcement agencies and finances shelters and other programs for battered women. That has set up a showdown with Senate Democrats, who have already passed legislation that would expand efforts to reach Indian tribes and include same-sex couples in programs for domestic violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama cited the travails of Lilly Ledbetter, for whom his administration's equal pay law is named, as well as pioneering legislation pushed by two senators, Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, and Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, his tone was upbeat and he was on familiar ground. Mr. Obama's sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, graduated from Barnard in 1993. Ten years earlier, he graduated from Columbia. (''I know there can be a little sibling rivalry here,'' he said.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama later spoke at a fund-raiser, where one of the hosts, Ricky Martin, the openly gay pop star, said he admired the president for his courage in endorsing same-sex marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Mr. Obama said: ''I want everyone treated fairly in this country. We have never gone wrong when we've extended rights and responsibilities to everybody. That doesn't weaken families; that strengthens families.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Obama and Mitt Romney agree on one thing about Medicare: the differences between them are huge. Each man says his opponent's policies would end Medicare as it now exists, undermining the rock-solid guarantee of health care for older Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the emphasis both parties are placing on health care as a defining political issue, their contrasting approaches to the government-run health insurance program serving 49 million people are certain to command considerable attention in both the presidential and Congressional campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama illustrated the importance he is placing on Medicare when, in a slap at Mr. Romney, he vowed this month: ''I will never allow Medicare to be turned into a voucher that would end the program as we know it. We're not going to go back to the days when our citizens spent their golden years at the mercy of private insurance companies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, who would limit the government's current open-ended financial commitment to Medicare, contends that Mr. Obama has no workable plan to prevent Medicare from going bankrupt. Under the Romney proposal, the government would contribute a fixed amount of money on behalf of each beneficiary, and future beneficiaries could use the money to buy private insurance or to help pay for traditional Medicare. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney says he offers not just a policy change, but ''a dramatic change in perspective and philosophy,'' and he cites his Medicare proposal as evidence of his willingness to tackle the cost of popular entitlement programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's 2010 health care law, Mr. Romney says, ''could lead to the rationing or denial of care for seniors,'' as it will squeeze nearly a half-trillion dollars from the growth of Medicare over 10 years while putting the program's future ''in the hands of 15 unelected bureaucrats.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama administration officials say the 2010 law improved Medicare's finances and extended the life of its hospital insurance trust fund. They say that the ''bureaucrats'' -- on the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- are a backstop to help control costs and cannot recommend rationing care, increasing premiums or cutting benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama assails the Romney proposal for the same reason he denounced a similar plan devised by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee: the government contribution, he says, would not keep up with the rising cost of health care, so Medicare beneficiaries -- older Americans and people with disabilities -- would have to pay more of the cost. Under the proposal, Mr. Obama says, the government would save money by shifting costs to beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. Romney say his proposal is very similar to the latest version of Mr. Ryan's plan, drafted with Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. But, the aides say, the Ryan plan offers more specifics than Mr. Romney has provided to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The side that can win public opinion on Medicare is likely to find its political position strengthened in November; Medicare is extremely popular with older Americans, who turn out to vote in large numbers and have historically trusted Democrats more than Republicans on health care. But that trust has been undermined by continual Republican criticism of the 2010 health care law, which Republicans say cut Medicare to help offset the cost of covering the uninsured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also wants to slow the growth of Medicare spending. The 2010 law throttles back payments to health care providers, including hospitals, nursing homes and health maintenance organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the law, Mr. Obama is testing new ways of delivering care, notably by encouraging doctors and hospitals to team up to coordinate care, to see if they save money and keep patients healthier. In his latest budget, Mr. Obama proposed $300 billion of further savings in Medicare, most of it from providers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 49 million Medicare beneficiaries, one-fourth already receive comprehensive care through H.M.O.s and other private plans run by companies like UnitedHealth, WellPoint and Humana. The number could rise significantly under Mr. Romney's proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medicare actuaries and trustees say Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund will be exhausted in 2024 under current law. And Medicare spending could surpass estimates based on current law. The law requires cutbacks in payments to providers that many experts see as unrealistic and unsustainable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea espoused by Mr. Romney -- known as premium support, because the government helps pay premiums -- has been around for more than 15 years. Liberal Democrats tend to view it as a right-wing idea to privatize Medicare. But Medicare's financial problems may ensure that ''premium support'' remains part of the political debate, whoever wins the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More moderate Democrats like former Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Alice M. Rivlin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, have endorsed the idea, with important qualifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traditional fee-for-service Medicare program should be one of the options for beneficiaries, along with commercial insurance plans, they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Mr. Romney's proposal, ''traditional Medicare will compete against private plans.'' How to ensure fair competition is a huge challenge, given the size of the traditional Medicare program and the government's power to regulate private plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A summary of the proposal, provided by the Romney campaign, explains how it would work: ''Traditional fee-for-service Medicare will be offered by the government as an insurance plan, meaning that seniors can purchase that form of coverage if they prefer it. However, if it costs the government more to provide that service than it costs private plans to offer their versions, then the premiums charged by the government will have to be higher, and seniors will have to pay the difference to enroll in the traditional Medicare option.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This prospect alarms many Democrats. But Mr. Romney says, ''Lower-income seniors will receive more generous support to ensure that they can afford coverage, and wealthier seniors will receive less support.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another crucial question is how the federal contribution to private plans would be calculated, updated and increased from year to year. If the government starts with the current level of Medicare spending and increases it to keep pace with the Consumer Price Index or the size of the economy, it would cover a smaller and smaller share of medical costs, which have historically grown faster than those benchmarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under his proposal, Mr. Romney says, the government contribution would be based on competitive bidding. An insurer's bid would reflect its estimate of the cost of providing a standard package of benefits to a typical beneficiary. Mr. Romney says tax increases are ''off the table'' as a way to deal with Medicare's financial problems. He would gradually increase the eligibility age for Medicare, now 65, by one month a year. In the long run, he says, the eligibility age should rise with life expectancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The type of competition Mr. Romney wants to see in Medicare is strikingly similar to the competition that is supposed to drive down commercial insurance prices under Mr. Obama's health care law. Under the law, people under 65 could choose among competing health plans offered through an insurance exchange in each state, and the government would subsidize premiums for lower- and middle-income people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Rivlin pointed to a curious paradox: ''Republicans object to exchanges in the Affordable Care Act and favor them in Medicare, while Democrats take the opposite, equally inconsistent, position.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Steel,'' a two-minute advertisement for President Obama's re-election campaign, will run on network television on Wednesday night in Colorado, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The campaign is spending less than $100,000 to air the ad, at least initially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON SCREEN Former employees of GS Technologies, a steel mill in Kansas City, Mo., appear at their homes, with family photographs and American flags behind them. Images of a once-bustling factory floor, illuminated with sparks from a steel furnace, flash on the screen. Mitt Romney is shown in a black-and-white photograph at Bain Capital and in short video clips from the campaign trail. The camera slowly pans across newspaper articles and corporate documents that chronicle the company's demise. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE SCRIPT Joe Soptic: ''I was a steelworker for 30 years. We had a reputation for quality products. It was something that was American made, and we weren't rich, but I was able to put my daughter through college.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Wiseman, steelworker: ''Having a good-paying job that you can support and raise a family on is hugely important.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Soptic: ''That stopped with the sale of the plant to Bain Capital.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney: ''I know how business works. I know why jobs come and why they go.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Foster, union negotiator: ''Bain Capital was the majority owner. They were responsible. Mitt Romney was deeply involved in the influence that he exercised over these companies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Soptic: ''They made as much money off it as they could, and they closed it down, they filed for bankruptcy, without any concern for the families or the communities.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack Cobb, steelworker: ''It was like a vampire, they came in and sucked the life out of us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Soptic: ''It was like watching an old friend bleed to death.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney: ''As I look around at the millions of Americans without work, it breaks my heart.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wiseman: ''Bain Capital sought elimination of the pension plan and termination of employee and retiree life insurance and health insurance.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Soptic: ''I was devastated. It makes me angry. Those guys were all rich, they all have more money than they'll ever spend. Yet they didn't have the money to take care of the very people that made the money for them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wiseman: ''Bain Capital walked away with a lot of money that they made off this plant. We view Mitt Romney as a job destroyer.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cobb: ''To get up on national TV and brag about making jobs, when he has destroyed thousands of people's careers, lifetimes, just destroying people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Soptic: ''He's running for president, and if he's going to run the country like the way he ran our business, I wouldn't want him there. He would be so out of touch with the average person in this country. How could you care? How could you care for the average working person if you feel that way?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama: ''I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this message.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCURACY In broad and blunt strokes, the commercial accurately portrays what happened to GS Technologies: it was bought by Bain Capital, ran into financial trouble and filed for bankruptcy. But it omits important details about Mr. Romney's role and oversimplifies the causes of the company's collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney was the chief executive and owner of Bain Capital, a private equity firm, when it bought a controlling ownership stake of GS Technologies in 1993, and he remained in that position as the factory's problems mounted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his role had changed by the time the steel mill filed for bankruptcy in 2001, leading to a layoff of 750 workers. By then, Mr. Romney had relinquished day-to-day oversight of Bain to run the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, though he remained chief executive and owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bain earned a profit of about $12 million from its investment in the mill. But it spent tens of millions of dollars trying to improve the struggling business, which was undercut by several factors, some self-inflicted, like rising debt, others beyond Bain's control, such as an influx of cheap imported steel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An overall tally of jobs created and lost under Mr. Romney's 15-year tenure at Bain is elusive, making it hard to verify the claim that, over all, he is a ''job destroyer.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCORECARD The ad packs an emotional punch and casts a dark shadow over Romney's biggest asset: his long career in finance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no good time for a presidential candidate to face what Mitt Romney faced last week, when The Washington Post reported that he had tormented a fellow student while at prep school in the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the months between the end of the primary season and the formal start of the general election at the conventions are an especially perilous period for candidates in Mr. Romney's position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is then that challengers to an incumbent are most susceptible to being defined on terms other than their own, because despite months on the campaign trail they are still not yet terribly well-known by many Americans. Unflattering characteristics, new elements of their record, gaffes and embarrassing biographical details - all can take on outsize importance as rival campaigns labor through the spring and summer to create perceptions that stick with voters through Election Day. The Obama campaign stepped up its efforts on that front on Monday with a new ad portraying Mr. Romney as a job killer during his years running Bain Capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be weeks or months before it is clear whether the image of Mr. Romney as youthful bully nearly a half-century ago puts an emotional punctuation mark on Democratic efforts to portray him as elitist and out of touch, or is swept away in the rush of other campaign developments and more contemporary issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the prep school story emerged, more Americans judged Mr. Romney unfavorably than favorably, according to the New York Times/CBS News poll, and perceptions of him are up for grabs among the more than a third of the country that does not yet have an opinion. As a result, Mr. Romney faces intense pressure to widen his appeal and lock in a more positive impression before the Obama campaign defines him on its terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The risks of failing to win the spring-summer narrative battle are substantial. Just ask Michael Dukakis, Bob Dole or John Kerry, all of whom failed to establish strong positive images during this period and allowed their opponents to brand them in ways they never overcame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1988, Vice President George Bush used Willie Horton starting in June to portray Mr. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee that year, as a soft-on-crime liberal. Mr. Dukakis never really found a way to respond, and was wiped out in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the spring of 1996, President Bill Clinton's team portrayed Mr. Dole as old and a tool of radical conservatives in Congress like Newt Gingrich. Mr. Dole desperately tried to establish a fresh identity for himself by resigning from the Senate in May, but could not establish a consistent case for his candidacy and was drubbed in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, President George W. Bush's campaign seized on a statement made by Mr. Kerry as he was wrapping up the Democratic nomination in March -- ''I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it'' - to portray him as a flip-flopper, a characterization that Mr. Kerry never shed. Combined with the attack on Mr. Kerry's military record later that summer by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, the flip-flop attacks helped provide Mr. Bush with his slim margin of victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Dole and Mr. Kerry shared a problem beyond the facts of their own records and statements: as they shifted into the general election after the primaries, they had not yet established favorable identities for themselves among voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerry was viewed unfavorably right after the end of the primary season in 2004 by about the same number of Americans who viewed him favorably; perhaps more importantly, fully half the country was undecided about him, making him something of a blank slate for Mr. Bush's team to fill in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dole consistently had negative favorable/unfavorable poll ratings, with more than a third of the country undecided about him through the spring and summer of 1996. He never won over enough of them to be competitive with Mr. Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dukakis had reasonably strong poll numbers as he wrapped up the Democratic nomination in 1988 - he was judged favorably by 38 percent in May and unfavorably by 14 percent - but like Mr. Kerry 16 years later, half the country was undecided about him. Within months, as Republicans pushed Willie Horton and other attacks, those undecided voters broke overwhelmingly for Mr. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winning candidates, by contrast, tend to reach late spring with at least as many people judging them favorably as unfavorably and to show quick progress in winning over undecideds. As Mr. Obama finally wrapped up the Democratic nomination in late spring of 2008, he was viewed favorably by 41 percent of Americans and unfavorably by 31 percent, with 27 percent undecided; by October he had pushed his favorability rating over 50 percent. (In 2000, both George W. Bush and Al Gore drove their favorability numbers higher during the period, setting up a battle that continued past Election Day.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preconvention perception battle is especially intense this year. The conventions are late (the Democrats will not wrap up until after Labor Day), meaning the formal general election season will be relatively short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early voting effectively shortens it even more in many places; voters in many states will start casting ballots in early October, making the final weeks of the campaign moot for them. And with three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate scheduled for October, the candidates will find it harder to control the message in the campaign's closing stages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The period between now and the conventions in late summer is a critical one, particularly for a challenger who is lesser known,'' said David Axelrod, the strategist for Mr. Obama's campaign. ''This is the period during which people really begin to to focus and formulate opinions. Though the debates and the inevitable, unplanned development could still sway some, by fall, impressions will be pretty hardened.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of which helps explain why both the Obama and Romney campaigns are so eager to get back on message this week. Mr. Obama's roll-out of his general election message last week was squashed when he was forced into taking a clear position on gay marriage. Mr. Romney, despite having been running for president more or less consistently since 2007, found his biographical narrative at risk of being altered in an unflattering way by a single news story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates have experienced and hard-hitting campaign teams, and their relative success in taking control of the candidates' images in the next month or two could go a long way toward determining what happens on Nov. 6.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook Is Said to Raise Offering Share Price &nbsp;|&nbsp; Facebook is planning to increase the price for its eagerly awaited initial public offering to a level that could value the company at as much as $104 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of high investor demand, the social network will seek a price in the range of $34 to $38 a share, up from an earlier $28 to $35 a share, people with knowledge of the matter said on Monday evening, speaking anonymously because the discussions were private. In Asia alone, Facebook's offering is more than 25 times oversubscribed, said a person briefed on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company, which will most likely stop accepting orders for its I.P.O. shares on Tuesday, is expected to price its shares on Thursday and start trading on the Nasdaq stock market on Friday. DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At JPMorgan, the 'Perfect Hedge' Remains Elusive &nbsp;|&nbsp; The chief investment office of JPMorgan Chase was supposed to place trades, including by hedging, to keep the firm from losing money. But part of the group's job may have been at odds with its stated goal of reducing risk: it was also supposed to turn its &quot;hedging&quot; trades into a tidy profit, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As investors, regulators and policy makers try to deconstruct the trading blunder at JPMorgan, it is worth revisiting the debate over the very definition of hedging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That definition is a crucial ingredient in the long-running battle in Washington over the proposed Volcker Rule, legislation aimed at curbing banks from making speculative bets. Or to put that in plain English, separating the casino from the bank. Yet the law leaves wiggle room for Wall Street firms to make trades as long as their intent is to &quot;hedge&quot; the firm from potential losses. (The banks, often led by JPMorgan, fought hard for that wiggle room.)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In rival videos, the Obama and Romney campaigns offer differing views of Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the most explosive moments in presidential campaigns are fueled by surprise. The political power of an unexpected allegation  often comes from the frenzy surrounding its revelation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That wasn't the case on Monday, when President Obama's campaign unveiled what might turn out to have been the most anticipated attack of the 2012 campaign: the critique of Mitt Romney's years at Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the new ad, Mr. Obama's campaign unleashes a broadside against Mr. Romney's business credentials, accusing him of being a corporate raider whose private equity firm preyed on weak companies, seeking profits, then tossed aside their employees with little regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, Priorities U.S.A., a &quot;super PAC&quot; backing Mr. Obama, is out with its own ad about Bain Capital, which echoes the theme set by Mr. Obama's campaign. The organization will spend $4 million to air its Bain ad in Colorado, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With Romney and Bain Capital, the objective was to make money,&quot; a  former employee of GST Steel, a company taken over by Bain Capital, says in the Priorities U.S.A. ad. &quot;If we lost, they made money. If we survived, they made money. It's as simple as that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks on Bain underscore the fundamental premise of Mr. Obama's campaign - that voters will reject the idea of handing the White House over to a wealthy businessman who got rich by buying and selling companies with little concern for workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conference call with reporters on Monday, Stephanie Cutter, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, said the fate of the GST Steel mill in Kansas City demonstrates what Mr. Romney's values are and &quot;what they tell us about what type of president Mr. Romney would be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Mr. Obama tries to make that case against Mr. Romney, he faces the challenge of reviving an issue that has been lodged against the Republican nominee for more than a decade, including by members of his own party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney survived attacks on Bain Capital when he ran for governor of Massachusetts in 2002. And he weathered charges of being a &quot;vulture capitalist&quot; by some of his Republican rivals earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview Monday evening, Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, shrugged off the attacks, saying they have already been litigated in the court of public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been down this road before,&quot; Mr. Fehrnstrom said. &quot;Attacks on how our free enterprise system works have a way of backfiring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may happen.  If voters conclude that Mr. Obama's attacks on Mr. Romney amount to an unfair criticism of capitalism, it might boomerang on the president as a political weapon. (It also has the potential to turn off wealthy donors who may already view Mr. Obama with suspicion because of his efforts to regulate the banking industry.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Mr. Romney's campaign is not ignoring the attacks. The Republican campaign quickly released its own Web-only video on Monday that tells the story of another steel plant that Mr. Romney's firm invested in. In this case, the company is thriving, having added thousands of jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When others shied away, Mitt Romney's private sector leadership team stepped in,&quot;  the ad says of the Bain Capital investment. &quot;Building a dream with over 6,000 employees today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quick response, with a video that was produced long before Monday, suggests that Mr. Romney's camp might be more worried than they are letting on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's one thing to weather attacks from a gubernatorial opponent in a statewide campaign. It's something altogether different when an aggressive presidential campaign like Mr. Obama's takes aim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Republican primaries, Mr. Romney fought back against the attacks from Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney by vastly outspending his rivals. He bombarded the airwaves with criticisms of their records, drowning out even the ads by the well-funded super PAC backing Mr. Gingrich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Mr. Obama's investment in the Bain attacks is tiny - the two-minute ad will run only once on Wednesday during the evening news. But in the end, Mr. Romney will not have the same kind of overwhelming position in the general election as he had in the primary battles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even though the outlines of the attack on Mr. Romney are not new, the specifics are powerful, especially to voters in states that were not subject to millions of dollars of campaign ads during the primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former employees of the GST plant in Kansas City offer emotional testimony about what happened to them - losing their jobs, their pensions, their health care benefits. They blame Mr. Romney even though he had left Bain Capital by the time the steel company went bankrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They came in, they bought the plant, and they made as much money off it as they could,&quot; said Joe Soptic, a former employee who told reporters during the conference call how the lack of health insurance affected his wife's battle with cancer. &quot;He is only worried about one group of people, and that's people like him, people at the top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign is betting that they can counter those employees with ones of their own. In the web video they released, employees of Steel Dynamics, the successful steel company in Indiana, thank Mr. Romney for creating jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it wasn't for a company like Steel Dynamics, this county wouldn't have a lot,&quot; one employee says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns take issue with the way the other tells the story of Mr. Romney's experience at Bain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign accuses Mr. Romney of taking undue credit for jobs at Steel Dynamics that didn't come until years later. Mr. Romney's campaign says the bankruptcy at GST Steel was the result of nationwide economic conditions that drove more than 30 similar plants out of business at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ferhnstrom also accuses Mr. Obama's campaign of &quot;desperation&quot; for beginning the Bain attack now, rather than in the final weeks of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were expecting Obama to launch his negative Bain attacks in the fall, closer to the election,&quot; Mr. Fehrnstrom said. &quot;He's moved up all of his negative attacks to the spring. It has the feel of a desperation move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But desperation or not, Mr. Obama's attacks have the potential to put a human face on the argument that Mr. Romney is an uncaring, wealthy politician whose business experience taught him the wrong lessons to deal with the economic struggles of the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the ads work with independent voters as Mr. Obama hopes, it could help cement that image. If it doesn't, Mr. Romney could once again emerge unscathed from the Bain attacks - and sitting in the White House.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Debating the significance of the Obama campaign's culture war forays. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My column over the weekend made the case that the Obama campaign's eagerness to change the subject from the economy to social issues has been winning them news cycles without helping their long-term cause. (Yesterday's Times/CBS poll showing Romney with a slight lead would seem to provide some confirmation of that point.) The New Republic's Alec MacGillis takes issue with my argument, suggesting that the Obama White House doesn't have a social issues strategy at all:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douthat would have a very good point to make here about short and long term gains if what he was saying was, well, true. But it's quite obviously not. The Obama campaign's underlying message and strategy so far have been all about contrasting his vision for the economy with Mitt Romney. That's what the campaign's official kickoff speeches in Ohio and Virginia&nbsp;were all about. (And yes, he gave his first speech in Ohio. Which would seem to call slightly into question Galston's claim that the campaign is effectively giving up on the state.) The campaign's first ads last week were all about the economy-a&nbsp;&quot;Morning in America&quot;-style economic comeback ad,ads about the auto-industry rescue. And today, lo and behold, comes a very hard-edged two-minute ad attacking Romney and Bain Capital over their ill treatment of a Missouri steel mill that was reaped for big profits before they shut it down<BR><BR>  Douthat could not have known that this ad was coming. But still, it should have been plain from the campaign's other recent signals that they had no intention of trying to pull a Bush (or&nbsp;)&nbsp;and make the campaign a cultural fight. Obama made the announcement on gay marriage last week because he had to-because Joe Biden forced his hand. But it's pretty plain that Chicago would rather fight this campaign on the terrain of a recovering auto industry and Bain's billions, rather than over gay rights. In this case, it was the pundits who were letting themselves be distracted by the 24-hour news cycle and missing the big picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think I should have more precise in my argument. I don't actually believe that the Obama campaign thinks that it can fight the election on &quot;war on women&quot; grounds from here to November. (They can't possibly be that idiotic!) Rather, I meant to argue that , team Obama has showed a clear willingness to embrace and even expand social-issues debates - a willingness that contrasts sharply with previous Democratic campaign, and suggests a calculated view that cultural terrain provides a useful opportunity to talk about something other than the economy. Whatever pressures Joe Biden and the gay rights movement brought to bear on him, the president didn't have to play the same-sex marriage issue the way he did, and the White House certainly didn't have to expand the HHS mandate debate into a broader culture war debate that dominated the political conversation for a month (and then helped inspire the misguided &quot;Life of Julia&quot; campaign, which tried to weave together lifestyle issues into a defense of the welfare state).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here I think it's MacGillis who's missing the bigger picture. Yes, of course, the White House is trying to build an economic narrative for the fall, one that weaves in everything from the Buffett Rule to the new Bain ad to many gambits yet to come. But the Obama campaign's willingness to talk social issues has been a consistent and consistently significant feature of the campaign to date, and it's certainly shaped news coverage of the election more than, say, the president's swing-state kickoff speeches did. It isn't the only thing that's been happening since January, but as a window into the state of the race and the thinking inside the White House, it seems like one of the most telling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mitt Romney blamed much of the nation's debt problem on President Obama, whom he called an &quot;old school&quot; liberal. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DES MOINES - Mitt Romney delivered a sweeping call for government austerity here on Monday, comparing the growth of federal spending and debt under President Obama to a fast-moving fire that threatens to engulf America's families.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Invoking what he called the common-sense &quot;kitchen table&quot; values of Iowans, who are known for their aversion to debt, Mr. Romney called for major reforms to entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid, the elimination of the president's health care program and a cap on federal spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A prairie fire of debt is sweeping across Iowa and our nation, and every day we fail to act that fire gets closer to the homes and children we love,&quot; Mr. Romney said to an audience of a few hundred at the Hotel Fort Des Moines. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He compared the federal deficit to a toxic home mortgage -- &quot;adjustable, no-money down and assigned to our children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Politicians have been trying to hide the truth about this nightmare mortgage for years - just like liar-loans,&quot; Mr. Romney said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney did not outline any new programs, but his speech marked a fresh and forceful emphasis on government spending, which his campaign views as a winning issue in an election year when the economy has shown only tepid improvement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial picture in Iowa, a swing state that Mr. Obama won in 2008, encapsulates the challenge for Mr. Romney. The state has weathered the recession far better than many of its neighbors; its employment rate is well below the national average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney blamed much of the debt problem on Mr. Obama, whom he called an &quot;old school&quot; liberal. &quot;Rather than put out the spending fire, he has fed the fire,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;America counted on President Obama to rescue the economy, tame the deficit and help create jobs. Instead, he bailed out the public sector, gave billions of dollars to the companies of his friends, and added almost as much debt as all the prior presidents combined.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Obama campaign, Lis Smith, said that the president had put forth a plan to cut $4 trillion in spending over the next decade, and criticized Mr. Romney for not outlining how he would pay for proposed across-the-board tax cuts. (Mr. Romney did not mention those tax cuts in his speech.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney simply wants to return to the same policies that caused the crisis and weakened the middle class: budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and letting Wall Street write its own rules,&quot; Ms. Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney began his speech by saying that the issue of debt was bipartisan, saying that &quot;the issue isn't who deserves the most blame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he returned, again and again, to what he characterized as the failed fiscal policies of Mr. Obama. In an especially pointed jab, Mr. Romney suggested that Mr. Obama's approach to government spending put him to the left of a Democratic predecessor, Bill Clinton, who was known for his centrist economic thinking, particularly on federal welfare programs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Obama tucked away the Clinton doctrine in his large drawer of discarded ideas, along with transparency and bipartisanship,&quot; Mr. Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's enough to make you wonder if maybe it was a personal beef with the Clintons,&quot; he added, to laughs from the audience. &quot;But really it runs much deeper.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has gone to bat for Indian tribes like few presidents before him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In less than four years, his administration has settled major tribal royalties disputes that had languished for years, relaxed a Bush-era rule that limited new, off-reservation casinos, included new health benefits for tribes in the sweeping 2010 health care overhaul and helped advance a landmark law that gives tribes power to prosecute serious crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, tribes are opening their checkbooks to aid his re-election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tribal governments have donated more than $1million to his campaign and his joint fundraising efforts with the Democratic National Committee.  They gave $264,000 to Obama in the 2008 election, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data compiled by the non-partisan Political MoneyLine. The analysis does not include any additional money contributed by individual tribal members or the employees of tribal enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has received more money directly from tribes than any other 2012 federal candidate, MoneyLine's tally shows. Republican presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney, by contrast, has received $3,000 combined from  two tribal sources, Oklahoma's Chickasaw Nation and the Prairie Island Tribal Council in Welch, Minn., according to federal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama &quot;has done more for Indian country than any president I can remember,&quot; said Chief James Allan, chairman of the Coeur d'Alene Tribe in northern Idaho, which donated $35,800 this year to Obama and his joint fundraising committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of a settlement announced last month, the 2,300-member nation is sharing $1 billion with 40 other tribes to end lawsuits that charged the federal government with mismanaging tribal money and land. Some of the claims were more than a century old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't get everything we want,&quot; said Jacqueline Pata, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, &quot;but we are actually able to participate in the dialogue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pata and other tribal advocates highlighted several recent accomplishments, including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $3.4 billion settlement of a nearly 15-year-old lawsuit that charged the federal government with mismanaging royalties for oil, gas and other leases on tribal land. It is the largest settlement ever approved against the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tribal law-and-order bill pushed by Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and signed into law in 2010 by Obama that gives tribes new powers, including authority to sentence criminals for up to three years, up from one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama directive to agency heads to make formal plans to consult with tribes on federal policies that affect them. He has hosted three White House summits with tribal leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One day we're going to be able to look back on these years and say it was a turning point in nation-to-nation relations,&quot; Obama said at a January fundraiser in Washington where some 70 tribal supporters donated at least $15,000 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2008 campaign, Obama sought tribal support as his protracted primary battle with Hillary Rodham Clinton took both candidates to states with significant Native American populations. Ahead of the Democratic primary in Montana, for instance, Obama was &quot;adopted&quot; by the Crow Nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Gallup, N.M., last month, Obama's campaign launched a tribal get-out-the-vote program. Native Americans represent less than 2% of the U.S. population, but make up more than 9% of the population in New Mexico, a key general-election battleground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tribes are a potential source of campaign money in the presidential race, where spending by the candidates and outside groups could easily exceed $2 billion. Tribal gambling has grown since 1998 when Congress authorized casinos on reservations. It's a $26 billion-a-year business, fast approaching the $35.6 billion in revenue that flowed last year to commercial casinos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheryl Schmit, an activist in Northern California who opposes the expansion of Indian gambling in her state, said non-Indians are too often shut out of the negotiations between tribes and the Obama administration, despite the impact of new development in surrounding communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tribal casinos make a lot of money and make major contributions,&quot; Schmit said.  &quot;Our voice is not heard in this process.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's campaign will air a two-minute TV ad and six-minute Web video Wednesday to call attention to the downside of Mitt Romney's private-equity career: layoffs. In the ad,  former steelworkers complain  about Bain Capital's takeover of their plant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script excerpts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steelworker 1: I was a steelworker for 30 years. We had a reputation for quality products.   And we weren't rich, but I was able to put my daughter through college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steelworker 2: Having a good-paying job that you can support and raise a family on is hugely important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steelworker 1: That stopped with the sale of the plant to Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney: I know how business works. I know why jobs come and why they go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union negotiator: Bain Capital was the majority owner. They were responsible. Mitt Romney was deeply involved in the influence that he exercised over these companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steelworker 1: They made as much money off it as they could. And they closed it down   without any concern for the families or the communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney: As I look around at the millions of Americans without work, it breaks my heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steelworker 2: Bain Capital sought elimination of the pension plan and termination of employee and retiree life insurance and health insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steelworker 1: I was devastated. It makes me angry. Those guys were all rich  yet they didn't have the money to take care of the very people that made the money for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steelworker 3: To   brag about making jobs when he has destroyed thousands of people's careers, lifetimes, just destroying people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steelworker 1: He's running for president, and if he's going to run the country the way he ran our business, I wouldn't want him there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad and  Web video represent gambles by the Obama campaign, because the economy and jobs are issues the Romney campaign  wants to talk about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The  ad aims to alienate Romney from  middle-class and union families whose votes could be crucial  in the states where the ad is running: Colorado, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. It seeks to turn  a Romney bragging point on its head by pointing out the downside of the private-equity business: Not all the companies that get taken over survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney's response to the ad was muted. His spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, noted the bankruptcy and 750 layoffs at GST Steel's Kansas City, Mo., plant came after Romney left to run the 2002 Winter Olympics.  &quot;We welcome the Obama campaign's attempt to pivot back to jobs and a discussion of their failed record,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad was also criticized by  former Obama ally  Steven Rattner, who headed the administration's effort to save the auto industry. &quot;I think the ad is unfair,&quot; Rattner said on MSNBC. &quot;To pick out an example of somebody who lost their job -- unfortunately, this is part of capitalism.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a two-minute ad that will air during the evening news Wednesday, the Obama campaign focuses on a shuttered steel mill in Kansas City, Mo., and the workers who lost their jobs after it went bankrupt under the supervision of Bain, a private-equity firm co-founded by Romney, now the likely GOP presidential nominee.           One former worker in the ad calls Bain a &quot;vampire&quot; that &quot;came in and sucked the life out of us.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The not-so-subtle theme - that Bain is a corporate menace that rewards investors at the expense of employees - mimics a strategy first used to devastating effect by then-Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who trounced Romney in a 1994 Senate race.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney team responded swiftly. Within hours, it released its own 60-second video, titled &quot;American Dream,&quot; about Bain's investment in Steel Dynamics, an Indiana company that Bain helped grow from 1,400 employees to more than 6,000. The campaign also distributed research to reporters and put senior adviser Ed Gillespie on a conference call with conservative bloggers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message from the Romney team was designed as both a defense and an attack: Obama just doesn't understand how the economy works. Sometimes businesses succeed, sometimes they don't - and the president would know that if he had spent any time in the private sector. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How the public comes to view Bain, a Boston-based company Romney led for 15 years, is critical to the former Massachusetts governor's chances in November. He has pointed to his time at Bain and the business experience he gained there as the singular reason he is the right man to fix the nation's troubled economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bain was a pioneer in an aspect of capitalism that was widely accepted before the economic meltdown. It invests in start-ups, such as Staples, an office supplies superstore, and it makes leveraged buyouts of ailing companies that can lead to large-scale job losses through restructuring. Many Americans now consider such maneuvers part of the problem, a facet of finance that enriches investors while caring little for workers and their communities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats are trying to tap into that sentiment to raise doubts about Romney. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the heart of his campaign,&quot; said Tad Devine, who helped craft similar Bain-related ads for Kennedy. &quot;And if you undercut that, there aren't a lot of places left for Romney to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two campaigns have been preparing for this moment for months: Obama began devising a Bain strategy over the winter, and the Romney team's response was pulled from a library of prepared videos. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad, which will air in Colorado, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, highlights the story of a steel mill that Bain bought in 1993. GST Steel eventually went bankrupt, costing 750 workers their jobs, as Bain's leaders walked away with an estimated $12 million in profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also started a new Web page, RomneyEconomics.com             , that shows a six-minute version of the video. The TV buy for Wednesday is not expected to be large, but advisers said the campaign will roll out more examples over the next several weeks as part of a broader strategy to portray Romney as a champion of the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.Using Bain to make that argument was undercut somewhat on Monday by Steven Rattner, Obama's former &quot;car czar,&quot; who said &quot;the ad is unfair.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt Romney made a mistake ever talking about the fact that he created 100,000 jobs,&quot; Rattner said on MSNBC. &quot;Bain Capital's responsibility was not to create 100,000 jobs or some other number. It was to create profits for its investors. . . . I don't think there's anything Bain Capital did that they need to be embarrassed about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign pointed out Monday that the candidate no longer worked at Bain at the time of GST Steel's 2001 bankruptcy; he had moved on two years earlier to lead the Salt Lake City Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama team responded that Romney oversaw Bain's purchase of GST and that he was still an officer earning profits when it went bankrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has his own connection to the private-equity industry. On Monday, he appeared at a fundraiser in Manhattan at the home of Hamilton &quot;Tony&quot; James, president of Blackstone Group, a large private-equity firm. Sixty people attended and donated $35,800 each. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second go-round over Bain for Romney this year. During the Republican primary, challengers Newt Gingrich and Texas Gov. Rick Perry went after Romney's record at the firm, with Perry famously referring to Romney as a &quot;vulture capitalist.&quot; Their arguments resonated less with Republican voters, many of whom dismissed them as an attack on capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gingrich's pollster, David Winston, said: &quot;Newt's attacking Romney over Bain didn't work, and Newt's moving off of it in South Carolina was a key decision in helping Newt win that primary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney responded at the time with a broad defense of free-market capitalism. And he argued that, overall, Bain helped create more jobs than the firm eliminated during his tenure there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, some Republican strategists said Romney and his allies need to fight back quickly, recalling how devastating the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth attacks became for Sen. John F. Kerry (D) in the 2004 race after he waited too long to fully respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the campaign and its surrogates and the outside groups need to get out the real story about his Bain record,&quot; said Rick Reed, who helped produce the Swift Boat ads and worked for Romney's 1994 campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Romney advisers said they have no interest in litigating the specifics of the GST Steel bankruptcy or any other examples the Obama campaign may highlight. Instead, they are trying to use the president's attack as an opening for a broader debate over the two candidates' economic credentials, believing that Romney's business know-how is his chief qualification for the presidency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every business entrepreneur knows that you have successes and failures, and in Mitt Romney's case, he's had many more successes than failures,&quot; said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to the candidate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, Pimco chief executive Mohamed el-Erian  and the Economist all say we should worry about something, we usually should.          Right now, they're warning  about the &quot;fiscal cliff&quot; - spending cuts and higher tax rates that will take effect on Jan. 1, unless Congress acts.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, the Congressional Budget Office calculated that the fiscal cliff will suddenly subtract $388 billion from the economy in fiscal 2013 (from Oct. 1, 2012 to Sept. 30, 2013), an amount equal to roughly 2.5 percent of national output. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, in turn, would hurt growth, possibly boosting unemployment above what it would otherwise be. Economist David Greenlaw of Morgan Stanley thinks the fiscal cliff could cut one percentage point from economic growth.          Still, I'm not freaking out. There are reasons to doubt Congress will let the full fiscal cliff materialize and that what does happen may not be all that devastating. In fact, here and there, the benefits of tightening might outweigh the costs.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An example of the latter is the Social Security payroll tax cut (which is not included in CBO's estimate). In February, Congress extended the cut, along with unemployment benefits, through the end of this year. Yes, the cut's expiration would hit working families right in the paycheck and curb consumer spending a bit, but extending the cut would rob Social Security of needed cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The improving jobs picture also makes extended unemployment benefits less indispensable; at the margins, they may dull the incentive to seek a job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CBO's $388 billion estimate assumes the expiration of all temporary tax provisions in current law. But one  such item is the $89 billion &quot;patch&quot; Congress applied to the alternative minimum tax. No matter how polarized Capitol Hill may be, it has always patched the AMT, and it's a safe bet that'll happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the largest spending cuts in current law is an across-the-board reduction in how much Medicare pays physicians. As with the AMT patch, Congress has always come up with &quot;doc fixes&quot; for Medicare in the past, and chances are it will again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These steps would reduce CBO's estimated fiscal cliff to $280 billion, according to Deutsche Bank economist Joseph Lavorgna. But even that number may overstate matters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CBO counts the expiration of accelerated capital depreciation for businesses as a $45 billion tax increase. As Lavorgna explains, this is a bit of a misnomer since not every business can take advantage of this targeted break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many economists think that, as an economic stimulus, accelerated depreciation delivers relatively little bang for the buck, which implies that eliminating it would not hurt growth as much as would other measures. Maybe it's a good thing to let capital allocation follow market signals rather than tax advantages.          Now we're down to $235 billion. Of that, the biggest item is $102 billion from the end of the Bush tax cuts. What to do about them is likely to be hugely controversial - but only for upper-income taxpayers. President Obama supports the lower- and middle-income Bush rates, so expect those to remain if he's reelected. Mitt Romney, of course, wants the Bush rates, or something like them, to be permanent. At most, we're looking at some uncertainty until after November, when Congress and the president will iron things out.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That leaves $133 billion, much of which comes from tax-break bits and pieces, including corporate welfare like the biodiesel fuel credit ($1.1 billion). Good riddance to them if they lapse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What remains are $60 billion in spending cuts, resulting from &quot;sequestration,&quot; as the automatic cuts in last year's debt-ceiling agreement are known. No doubt these cuts are controversial, and a blunt instrument. Republicans in the House are already fighting to save defense spending; Democrats are condemning them for doing so at the expense of social programs. It's doubtful the Senate will act on any bill the House produces. But whatever happens, $60 billion is  small change compared to the  $15.4 trillion U.S. economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best solution would be a &quot;grand bargain&quot; that reforms the tax code and entitlements, and gradually sets the country on a sustainable long-term path. Alas, this is also the least likely solution. We're in for some fiscal tightening and some spectacular political fireworks. In the end, though, the actual threat to economic growth may be more manageable than it now seems.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans say they're eager for the presidential campaign to turn away from &quot;distractions&quot; and focus instead on the economy. Someone should warn them that if they're not careful, they might get their wish.          It is true that voters' unhappiness with high unemployment and slow growth poses a challenge for President Obama as he seeks reelection. But for Mitt Romney and the GOP to take advantage of this potential opening, they'll have to do more than chant the word &quot;economy&quot; like a mantra. They have to make the case that their policies will work better than Obama's.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what might Romney's proposed economic policies be? Why, they're basically the same as those of George W. Bush, only worse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as Obama owns the recession and the slow recovery, Bush owns the financial crisis that sent the slumping economy over a cliff. But for all his sins - the gratuitous tax cuts, the off-budget wars, the defiance of basic arithmetic - Bush at least demonstrated a certain empathy for Americans who struggle to make ends meet. One of his budget-busting initiatives, for example, was expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs without worrying about how this much-needed new benefit would be paid for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's safe to predict that Romney would never make such a gesture out of compassion for the beleaguered middle class. To this day, he refuses to take back his criticism of Obama for bailing out General Motors and Chrysler - even though letting the companies fail would have meant the extinction of the U.S. auto industry and the elimination of hundreds of thousands of jobs.          It is a measure of Romney's ideological stubbornness that, even with Chrysler rebounding under new ownership and GM reporting record profits, he still insists that his view - let the companies go bankrupt so the &quot;creative destruction&quot; of capitalism could work its magic - was correct.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney is something of an expert on creative destruction, I guess, having orchestrated a good deal of it while running the private-equity firm Bain Capital. The Obama campaign recently released an ad about one of Bain's less successful acquisitions, a small steel mill in Kansas City called GST Steel.          The company, which was more than 100 years old, failed after a decade under Bain's ownership; GST's 750 employees lost their jobs, pensions and health benefits. Bain, however, made money, investing $8 million in the company and taking out $4 million in profits and $4.5 million in management fees. The Romney campaign contends that GST, with its unionized workforce, could not compete with cheap foreign steel being dumped on the market. The Obama campaign alleges that Bain burdened GST with crushing debt while sucking the company's coffers dry.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this the genius of free markets at work, or is it &quot;vulture capitalism&quot; run amok? Let's have that argument. Please.Let's also have a long, detailed discussion of Romney's economic plans versus Obama's. Romney wants to make tax rates for the wealthy even lower than they are now; Obama wants a small increase for those making more than $1 million a year, whom he challenges to pay &quot;their fair share.&quot; Romney's entire economic plan, basically, involves tax cuts and deregulation - in other words, a repeat of the Bush-era policies that led to the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Does Romney have any fresh ideas? Well, when he was governor of Massachusetts, he was smart enough to see that universal health coverage would not only improve the lives of the uninsured but also help rein in runaway medical costs. He found the solution in an innovative idea developed in Republican-leaning think tanks: an individual health insurance mandate.          It worked. In fact, it was Romney's greatest policy success as a public official. But now he doesn't talk about it much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My guess is that Republicans won't want to talk about the past or the future in much detail. They'd like to keep things blurry, so that we only see Romney in broad outline: a successful businessman who'll put us back in business. For details, we'll mail you the prospectus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can't help but think of the &quot;prosperity theology&quot; movement, or scam, in which preachers persuade congregants that God's will is for Christians to be rich - and that the way to become rich is to put lots of money in the collection plate. It's not believable unless the preacher looks and acts the part. Maybe he lives in a mansion. Maybe his wife drives &quot;a couple of Cadillacs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, it's not believable even then. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama team responded that Romney oversaw Bain's purchase of GST and that he was still an officer earning profits when it went bankrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has his own connection to the private-equity industry. On Monday, he appeared at a fundraiser in Manhattan at the home of Hamilton &quot;Tony&quot; James, president of Blackstone Group, a large private-equity firm. Sixty people attended and donated $35,800 each. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second go-round over Bain for Romney this year. During the Republican primary, challengers Newt Gingrich and Texas Gov. Rick Perry went after Romney's record at the firm, with Perry famously referring to Romney as a &quot;vulture capitalist.&quot; Their arguments resonated less with Republican voters, many of whom dismissed them as an attack on capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gingrich's pollster, David Winston, said: &quot;Newt's attacking Romney over Bain didn't work, and Newt's moving off of it in South Carolina was a key decision in helping Newt win that primary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney responded at the time with a broad defense of free-market capitalism. And he argued that, overall, Bain helped create more jobs than the firm eliminated during his tenure there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, some Republican strategists said Romney and his allies need to fight back quickly, recalling how devastating the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth attacks became for Sen. John F. Kerry (D) in the 2004 race after he waited too long to fully respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the campaign and its surrogates and the outside groups need to get out the real story about his Bain record,&quot; said Rick Reed, who helped produce the Swift Boat ads and worked for Romney's 1994 campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Romney advisers said they have no interest in litigating the specifics of the GST Steel bankruptcy or any other examples the Obama campaign may highlight. Instead, they are trying to use the president's attack as an opening for a broader debate over the two candidates' economic credentials, believing that Romney's business know-how is his chief qualification for the presidency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every business entrepreneur knows that you have successes and failures, and in Mitt Romney's case, he's had many more successes than failures,&quot; said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to the candidate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, Pimco chief executive Mohamed el-Erianand the Economist all say we should worry about something, we usually should.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right now, they're warning  about the &quot;fiscal cliff&quot; - spending cuts and higher tax rates that will take effect on Jan. 1, unless Congress acts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, the Congressional Budget Office calculated that the fiscal cliff will suddenly subtract $388 billion from the economy in fiscal 2013 (from Oct. 1, 2012 to Sept. 30, 2013), an amount equal to roughly 2.5 percent of national output. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, in turn, would hurt growth, possibly boosting unemployment above what it would otherwise be. Economist David Greenlaw of Morgan Stanley thinks the fiscal cliff could cut one percentage point from economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, I'm not freaking out. There are reasons to doubt Congress will let the full fiscal cliff materialize and that what does happen may not be all that devastating. In fact, here and there, the benefits of tightening might outweigh the costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An example of the latter is the Social Security payroll tax cut (which is not included in CBO's estimate). In February, Congress extended the cut, along with unemployment benefits, through the end of this year. Yes, the cut's expiration would hit working families right in the paycheck and curb consumer spending a bit, but extending the cut would rob Social Security of needed cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The improving jobs picture also makes extended unemployment benefits less indispensable; at the margins, they may dull the incentive to seek a job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CBO's $388 billion estimate assumes the expiration of all temporary tax provisions in current law. But one  such item is the $89 billion &quot;patch&quot; Congress applied to the alternative minimum tax. No matter how polarized Capitol Hill may be, it has always patched the AMT, and it's a safe bet that'll happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the largest spending cuts in current law is an across-the-board reduction in how much Medicare pays physicians. As with the AMT patch, Congress has always come up with &quot;doc fixes&quot; for Medicare in the past, and chances are it will again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These steps would reduce CBO's estimated fiscal cliff to $280 billion, according to Deutsche Bank economist Joseph Lavorgna. But even that number may overstate matters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CBO counts the expiration of accelerated capital depreciation for businesses as a $45 billion tax increase. As Lavorgna explains, this is a bit of a misnomer since not every business can take advantage of this targeted break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many economists think that, as an economic stimulus, accelerated depreciation delivers relatively little bang for the buck, which implies that eliminating it would not hurt growth as much as would other measures. Maybe it's a good thing to let capital allocation follow market signals rather than tax advantages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we're down to $235 billion. Of that, the biggest item is $102 billion from the end of the Bush tax cuts. What to do about them is likely to be hugely controversial - but only for upper-income taxpayers. President Obama supports the lower- and middle-income Bush rates, so expect those to remain if he's reelected. Mitt Romney, of course, wants the Bush rates, or something like them, to be permanent. At most, we're looking at some uncertainty until after November, when Congress and the president will iron things out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That leaves $133 billion, much of which comes from tax-break bits and pieces, including corporate welfare like the biodiesel fuel credit ($1.1 billion). Good riddance to them if they lapse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What remains are $60 billion in spending cuts, resulting from &quot;sequestration,&quot; as the automatic cuts in last year's debt-ceiling agreement are known. No doubt these cuts are controversial, and a blunt instrument. Republicans in the House are already fighting to save defense spending; Democrats are condemning them for doing so at the expense of social programs. It's doubtful the Senate will act on any bill the House produces. But whatever happens, $60 billion is  small change compared to the  $15.4 trillion U.S. economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best solution would be a &quot;grand bargain&quot; that reforms the tax code and entitlements, and gradually sets the country on a sustainable long-term path. Alas, this is also the least likely solution. We're in for some fiscal tightening and some spectacular political fireworks. In the end, though, the actual threat to economic growth may be more manageable than it now seems.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans say they're eager for the presidential campaign to turn away from &quot;distractions&quot; and focus instead on the economy. Someone should warn them that if they're not careful, they might get their wish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true that voters' unhappiness with high unemployment and slow growth poses a challenge for President Obama as he seeks reelection. But for Mitt Romney and the GOP to take advantage of this potential opening, they'll have to do more than chant the word &quot;economy&quot; like a mantra. They have to make the case that their policies will work better than Obama's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what might Romney's proposed economic policies be? Why, they're basically the same as those of George W. Bush, only worse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as Obama owns the recession and the slow recovery, Bush owns the financial crisis that sent the slumping economy over a cliff. But for all his sins - the gratuitous tax cuts, the off-budget wars, the defiance of basic arithmetic - Bush at least demonstrated a certain empathy for Americans who struggle to make ends meet. One of his budget-busting initiatives, for example, was expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs without worrying about how this much-needed new benefit would be paid for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's safe to predict that Romney would never make such a gesture out of compassion for the beleaguered middle class. To this day, he refuses to take back his criticism of Obama for bailing out General Motors and Chrysler - even though letting the companies fail would have meant the extinction of the U.S. auto industry and the elimination of hundreds of thousands of jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a measure of Romney's ideological stubbornness that, even with Chrysler rebounding under new ownership and GM reporting record profits, he still insists that his view - let the companies go bankrupt so the &quot;creative destruction&quot; of capitalism could work its magic - was correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney is something of an expert on creative destruction, I guess, having orchestrated a good deal of it while running the private-equity firm Bain Capital. The Obama campaign recently released an ad about one of Bain's less successful acquisitions, a small steel mill in Kansas City called GST Steel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company, which was more than 100 years old, failed after a decade under Bain's ownership; GST's 750 employees lost their jobs, pensions and health benefits. Bain, however, made money, investing $8 million in the company and taking out $4 million in profits and $4.5 million in management fees. The Romney campaign contends that GST, with its unionized workforce, could not compete with cheap foreign steel being dumped on the market. The Obama campaign alleges that Bain burdened GST with crushing debt while sucking the company's coffers dry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this the genius of free markets at work, or is it &quot;vulture capitalism&quot; run amok? Let's have that argument. Please.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's also have a long, detailed discussion of Romney's economic plans versus Obama's. Romney wants to make tax rates for the wealthy even lower than they are now; Obama wants a small increase for those making more than $1 million a year, whom he challenges to pay &quot;their fair share.&quot; Romney's entire economic plan, basically, involves tax cuts and deregulation - in other words, a repeat of the Bush-era policies that led to the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does Romney have any fresh ideas? Well, when he was governor of Massachusetts, he was smart enough to see that universal health coverage would not only improve the lives of the uninsured but also help rein in runaway medical costs. He found the solution in an innovative idea developed in Republican-leaning think tanks: an individual health insurance mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It worked. In fact, it was Romney's greatest policy success as a public official. But now he doesn't talk about it much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My guess is that Republicans won't want to talk about the past or the future in much detail. They'd like to keep things blurry, so that we only see Romney in broad outline: a successful businessman who'll put us back in business. For details, we'll mail you the prospectus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can't help but think of the &quot;prosperity theology&quot; movement, or scam, in which preachers persuade congregants that God's will is for Christians to be rich - and that the way to become rich is to put lots of money in the collection plate. It's not believable unless the preacher looks and acts the part. Maybe he lives in a mansion. Maybe his wife drives &quot;a couple of Cadillacs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, it's not believable even then. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Will the corporate takeover of lobbying firms make us surprisingly nostalgic for the old school version? <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the American political classes become more polarized, with faction pitted against faction, there is a consolidating force at work in the $6 billion-a-year influence-peddling industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once a free-wheeling, if ethically challenged, crowd of men (and almost no women), who swapped stories about their clients over Jack Daniels, these expert manipulators of the legislative process and of public opinion have become corporate employees. Slowly but surely, WPP, an immense international holding company based in London - with a workforce of 158,000 in 107 countries and 2011 billings of $72.3 billion - has been buying up Washington's top lobbying, public relations, advertising and political strategy firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WPP has become, in effect, a special interest mega-firm, with offerings for conservatives and liberals, environmentalists and polluters, gun lovers and gun haters, Tea Party die-hards and public sector unions, old guard media and their high tech competitors - the entire gamut from left to right, top to bottom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies once viewed by those in politics as independent powerhouses - QGA (formerly Quinn Gillespie), Glover Park, Hill+Knowlton, Burson-Marsteller, Public Strategies, Prime Policy Group, Dewey Square, Ogilvy Government Relations, Wexler &amp; Walker - are now &nbsp;minor players in a marketing-communications conglomerate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the process, Washington political media strategy shops have come to play second fiddle to the biggest money makers for WPP - Madison Avenue advertising firms like Y &amp; R.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consolidation of the special interest and influence communities - lobbying, public relations, media strategy, political consulting, fundraising, the bread and butter of Washington - has substantial consequences:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*As more and more members of the House and Senate leave their positions to go into these lucrative fields, one company more than any other will oversee their compensation, bonuses, performance requirements and tenure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*In the formerly highly entrepreneurial fields of public relations, lobbying, and legislative and election strategizing, the young and hungry are no longer rewarded with glamorous renegade stature (for example, Lee Atwater and Roger Stone). Nor can they count on equity in a small but growing operation. Now they must get their rewards in stock options and bonuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Although a center of world power, Washington, from the vantage point of WPP, is a profitable second tier market, a city subordinate to the glitter and cash of New York, London, Paris and Buenos Aires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why, unlike most of his competitors, he had kept his firm independent, the Democratic strategist Lawrence F. O'Brien, III, founder of the OB-C Group, LLC, whose clients include Anheuser-Busch, Eli Lilly, Honeywell International and K.K.R., emailed The Times:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Master of own destiny, create your own work place rules and atmospherics and performance standards, report to no one else, answer to no one else, far better able to discern and manage potential client &quot;conflicts&quot; in a thoroughly professional and ethical manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A top Republican lobbyist, who has tried out working for a conglomerate but is now back on his own, described the former experience as &quot;poison.&quot; The conglomerate &quot;sucks out 40 to 50 percent of the profit, and your bonus is set by folks in some other city,&quot; he said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WPP is prepared to swallow everybody with a profitable bottom line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after the 2004 election, four Internet specialists who had worked for Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean founded Blue State Digital &quot;to develop tools and strategic services that would empower campaigns and cause-related organizations to build meaningful action-oriented communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, Blue State asserted that it had &quot;raised more than $500 million online, mobilized millions of volunteers, and built an unprecedented community of 13 million individual supporters that helped propel President Obama into office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, at the end of 2010, WPP bought Blue State. &quot;Any political clients are still going to reflect our values,&quot; Joe Rospars, a founding partner, told Fast Company, affirming the company's ideological commitment, before adding:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we really liked about WPP was that they have a broad network of companies in spaces that are complementary to where we work - whether it's in advertising, research, or general consulting. We're working alongside different companies like that all the time, so having closer relationships with them makes our work better and makes the overall experience for the client better. The other thing about WPP is its international footprint. They're in over 100 countries. Having a set of ready-made potential partners in different countries will offer us the opportunity to take both our agency services as well as our technology to market in a much more organized fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Sorrell, WPP's C.E.O., argues that there are three major advantages for a Washington firm that joins an international company like WPP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, in Sorrell's view, successful representation increasingly &quot;depends on international connections and international capabilities are becoming more and more important.&quot; Second, lobbying and other forms of advocacy require access to multiple communications systems, including social media, advertising and others that WPP can offer to its individual subsidiaries. Third, while lobbying used to be based primarily on &quot;who you know, not what you know,&quot; now detailed understanding of issues in all their complexity is essential, putting a relatively small independent operation at a competitive disadvantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WPP (&quot;the Group&quot;) describes itself this way in its 2011 annual report:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are more than 150 companies within the Group - and each is a distinctive brand in its own right. Each has its own identity, commands its own loyalty, and is committed to its own specialist expertise. That is their individual strength. Clients seek their talent and their experience on a brand-by-brand basis. Between them, our companies work with 344 of the Fortune Global 500, all 30 of the Dow Jones 30, 63 of the NASDAQ 100 and 33 of the Fortune e-50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What this means in Washington is that WPP is everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It you want a lobbyist with close ties to Mitt Romney, look no further than Charlie Black, the iconic Republican operative, now a senior Romney campaign adviser and chairman of the Prime Policy Group. Or top fundraiser Wayne Berman at Ogilvy Government Relations&nbsp; (distinct from another WPP subsidiary, Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Want a former member of the House? How about Norman Mineta at Hill+Knowlton - he represented California in the House and was Secretary of Transportation under George W. Bush, not a bad choice to lobby Congress and DOT on behalf of the U.S. Coalition for Advanced Diesel Cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bain Capital, the company Romney helped found, sought to hire someone to &quot;monitor tax reform developments&quot; - in other words, to watch out for ominous changes in the tax code - it turned to WPP's Public Strategies, paying the firm $320,000 in 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two other advertising and media conglomerates buying up Washington, Interpublic and Omnicom Group, but they remain minor league compared to WPP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omnicom is &quot;a strategic holding company that manages a portfolio of global market leaders&quot; It owns, and recently merged into one firm, Clark and Weinstock, a Washington-based operation run by Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman and lobbying superstar, and Mercury, which boasts a leadership team including former Republican Senator Jim Talent and former Democratic House member Max Sandlin. Clark and Weinstock collected $5.9 million in lobbying fees in 2011, and Mercury made $2.9 million that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intergroup, &quot;one of the world's premier advertising and marketing services companies,&quot; owns Cassidy &amp; Associates, which, in 2011, had lobbying billings of $19.8 million from such clients as AT&amp;T, Bayer AG, B.M.W., Estee Lauder and the Motion Picture Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlie Black, who in 1980 founded Black, Manafort and Stone, now runs the WPP-owned Prime Policy Group, which&nbsp; absorbed both B.M. &amp; S. and the former Timmons &amp; Co. In 2011, Prime had billings of $10.9 million, including such high dollar clients as AT&amp;T ($480,000 in 2011 billings), Chrysler ($280,000), and the Securities Industry &amp; Financial Markets Association ($240,000). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black said in a phone interview that becoming a subsidiary &quot;changes things. You have some accountability to the parent company, you work out with them, budget goals, what to bring in. If you miss your numbers, they get upset.&quot; At the same time, he said, there are the advantages of &quot;cross-pollination&quot; with client references from other firms and sharing clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter Eskew, a founding partner of the firm Glover Park, argued in an interview that getting acquired by WPP &quot;gave us more managerial flexibility.&quot; Glover Park was started with backing from a private equity company that demanded high annual returns in the 40 percent range, Eskew said. &quot;We were slaves to margins.&quot; WPP has put much more stress on long-term growth and on reinvesting profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversion of the lobbyist from a backslapper into the &quot;man in a gray flannel suit&quot; has already had a significant effect on American politics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most important is that the influence industry has become unexpectedly depoliticized and disaffected. While disdained by the public at large, many lobbyists, campaign consultants, and P.R. types were, in the past, deeply concerned with and involved in the political system. They were personally vested in the institution of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The steady take-over of this unofficial branch of government by WPP, Omnicom, Interpublic and other conglomerates has turned premier lobbyists, strategists and political operatives into a species of bureaucrat, now vested in bottom-line corporate goals. Their interest in the substance of what Congress accomplishes, in policy outcomes, and in the direction of the country, has diminished. In fact, one could say that the more legislative dysfunction, the more billable hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's chipped away at the quality of work on both sides,&quot; says a senior Democratic operative, now a partner in an independent boutique lobbying and public relations firm. &quot;This has become a business where mediocrity abounds. Once you get bought, you are dis-incentivized. There's no pride of ownership, and everyone knows the top folks are going to leave as soon as their earn-out comes to an end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the corporatization of K Street and of the political consulting industry has taken on a momentum and inevitability that assure the process will continue, regardless of the consequences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The Obama campaign is running a new ad portraying Mitt Romney as an uncaring corporate titan more concerned with profits than workers, reviving attacks from the Republican primaries. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2:01 p.m. | Updated  President Obama has begun a major advertising push to portray Mitt Romney, his presumptive Republican rival in November, as an uncaring corporate titan who is concerned more with profits than with workers, reviving attacks on Mr. Romney's career at Bain Capital that began in earnest during the Republican primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's campaign is running a two-minute television ad in &quot;select battleground&quot; states that features the laid-off workers from a steel company in Kansas City that Bain, the private equity firm Mr. Romney founded almost three decades ago, acquired and shut down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign also started a new Web site, romneyeconomics.com, that accuses Mr. Romney of engaging in business that was &quot;profitable for a handful of corporate investors, but sometimes devastating for local communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the new ad, former employees of GST Steel express anger at Bain. &quot;Bain Capital walked away with a lot of money that they made off of this plant,&quot; one former worker says. &quot;We view Mitt Romney as a job destroyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another says Mr. Romney &quot;destroyed thousands of people's careers, lifetimes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack on Mr. Romney's record at Bain is similar to efforts his Republican rivals made in January. At the time, Newt Gingrich and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas sought to stop Mr. Romney's momentum by portraying him as a corporate raider who shut down businesses and laid off workers for profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gingrich released a 28-minute documentary titled &quot;King of Bain&quot; that accused Mr. Romney of being a &quot;scavenger&quot; and that said he and his colleagues were &quot;bad guys.&quot; Critics accused the film of taking liberties with Mr. Romney's record, but it helped Mr. Gingrich win the South Carolina primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Perry called Mr. Romney a &quot;vulture capitalist&quot; and used the same steel company that is featured in Mr. Obama's new ad as evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the advertising by Mr. Romney's rivals in January was aimed at South Carolina voters. Now, Mr. Obama is hoping that the same message will be effective for a broader audience as his campaign seeks to emphasize Mr. Romney's personal wealth and undermine his business expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Mr. Romney's campaign, Andrea Saul, said it welcomed &quot;the Obama campaign's attempt to pivot back to jobs and a discussion of their failed record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Saul added that the bankruptcy and layoffs at GST Steel occurred after Mr. Romney had left Bain in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One question for Mr. Obama's campaign is whether the Republican attacks on Bain several months ago will make the new advertising campaign less effective by making it seem like old news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign is certainly more prepared to respond, given the weeks of criticism that he weathered during the primaries. And news organizations may not cover the accusations in the same way the second time around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, most of the voters that Mr. Obama's campaign is targeting have probably not seen the details of the criticism. To them, the ads could seem like powerful new evidence that Mr. Romney's is a wealthy, out-of-touch businessman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bain Capital acquired GST Steel in 1993. The company made grinding balls, rods, castings and control systems for use in the mining industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company declared bankruptcy in 2001. In the ad, former employees accuse Bain Capital and Mr. Romney of seeking to eliminate their pension plan and health and life insurance. A longer, 6-minute version of the ad was posted on Mr. Obama's Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They made as much money off it as they could, and they closed it down and filed for bankruptcy without any concern for the families or the communities,&quot; one former employee says. &quot;It was like watching an old friend bleed to death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign followed up the release of the ad on Monday by holding a conference call with one of the employes who lost his job at GST Steel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Soptic told reporters that he had worked at the steel mill for almost 30 years before losing his job when the company declared bankruptcy. He blamed Mr. Romney and Bain Capital for focusing only on profit and for eventually destroying the steel mill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They came in, they bought the plant, and they made as much money off it as they could,&quot; mr. Soptic said. &quot;He is only worried about one group of people, and that's people like him, people at the top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all of Mr. Obama's supporters are as critical of what Mr. Romney and Bain Capital did. Steve Ratner, who served as Mr. Obama's &quot;auto czar&quot; early in the administration, said on MSNBC's &quot;Morning Joe&quot; program that Bain should be judged by what it was intended to do: make money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was to create profits for his investors, most of whom were pension funds, endowments and foundations,&quot; Mr. Ratner said. &quot;It did it superbly, acting within the rules and acting very responsibly and was a leading firm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Stephanie Cutter, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, said that's exactly the point of their critique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His experiences were about creating wealth - wealth for himself, his partners and his investors,&quot; she told reporters on the conference call. &quot;G.S.T. workers really lost out and Romney and his partners did not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;A president like that would be a disaster for the middle class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bain Capital released a statement in response to the ad, suggesting its record was being &quot;distorted&quot; in the heat of a political campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bain Capital is focused on growing great companies and improving their operations.&nbsp; We are not a political organization, and take no public position on any candidate.&nbsp; Mitt Romney retired from Bain Capital over 13 years ago, but we understand that in a political campaign our exemplary 28-year record will be distorted and complex business situations will be portrayed in a simplistic way. We are extremely proud of our employees and management teams, who have grown revenues in over 80 percent of our 350 companies, which include over 100 start-up investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bain Capital undertook an ambitious plan in 1993 to turnaround GSI, a struggling manufacturer of specialty steel products that was slated for closure if no investor could be found.&nbsp; We invested more than $100 million and many thousands of hours into this turnaround, upgrading its facilities in an attempt to make the company competitive. This was unfortunately at a time when the steel industry came under enormous pressure, and nearly half of all U.S. steel companies went into bankruptcy. During the same period, we helped launch and grow Steel Dynamics, an innovative business that is today the 5th largest steel company in America, a $6 billion global leader, and home to more than 6,000 workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The months between the end of the primary season and the formal start of the general election at the conventions are an especially perilous period for candidates in Mitt Romney's position. Just ask Michael Dukakis, Bob Dole or John Kerry. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    There is no good time for a presidential candidate to face what Mitt Romney faced last week, when The Washington Post reported that he had tormented a fellow student while at prep school in the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    But the months between the end of the primary season and the formal start of the general election at the conventions are an especially perilous period for candidates in Mr. Romney's position. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">      It is then that challengers to an incumbent are most susceptible to being defined on terms other than their own, because despite months on the campaign trail they are still not yet terribly well-known by many Americans. Unflattering characteristics, new elements of their record, gaffes and embarrassing biographical details - all can take on outsize importance as rival campaigns labor through the spring and summer to create perceptions that stick with voters through Election Day.  The Obama campaign stepped up its efforts on that front on Monday with a new ad portraying Mr. Romney as a job killer during his years running Bain Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   It may be weeks or months before it is clear whether the image of Mr. Romney as youthful bully nearly a half-century ago puts an emotional punctuation mark on Democratic efforts to portray him as elitist and out of touch, or is swept away in the rush of other campaign developments and more contemporary issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Even before the prep school story emerged, more Americans judged Mr. Romney unfavorably than favorably, according to the New York Times/CBS News poll, and perceptions of him are up for grabs among the more than a third of the country that does not yet have an opinion. As a result, Mr. Romney faces intense pressure to widen his appeal and lock in a more positive impression before the Obama campaign defines him on its terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">     The risks of failing to win the spring-summer narrative battle are substantial. Just ask Michael Dukakis, Bob Dole or John Kerry, all of whom failed to establish strong positive images during this period and allowed their opponents to brand them in ways they never overcame. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">           In 1988, Vice President George Bush used Willie Horton starting in June to portray Mr. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee that year, as a soft-on-crime liberal. Mr. Dukakis never really found a way to respond, and was wiped out in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          In the spring of 1996, President Bill Clinton's team portrayed Mr. Dole as old and a tool of radical conservatives in Congress like Newt Gingrich. Mr. Dole desperately tried to establish a fresh identity for himself by resigning from the Senate in May, but could not establish a consistent case for his candidacy and was drubbed in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        In 2004, President George W. Bush's campaign seized on a statement made by Mr. Kerry as he was wrapping up the Democratic nomination in March -- &quot;I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it&quot; - to portray him as a flip-flopper, a characterization that Mr. Kerry never shed. Combined with the attack on Mr. Kerry's military record later that summer by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, the flip-flop attacks helped provide Mr. Bush with his slim margin of victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">      Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Dole and Mr. Kerry shared a problem beyond the facts of their own records and statements: as they shifted into the general election after the primaries, they had not yet established favorable identities for themselves among voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">      Mr. Kerry was viewed unfavorably right after the end of the primary season in 2004 by about the same number of Americans who viewed him favorably; perhaps more importantly, fully half the country was undecided about him, making him something of a blank slate for Mr. Bush's team to fill in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">      Mr. Dole consistently had negative favorable/unfavorable poll ratings, with more than a third of the country undecided about him through the spring and summer of 1996. He never won over enough of them to be competitive with Mr. Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">     Mr. Dukakis had reasonably strong poll numbers as he wrapped up the Democratic nomination in 1988 - he was judged favorably by 38 percent in May and unfavorably by 14 percent - but like Mr. Kerry 16 years later, half the country was undecided about him. Within months, as Republicans pushed Willie Horton and other attacks, those undecided voters broke overwhelmingly for Mr. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">       Winning candidates, by contrast, tend to reach late spring with at least as many people judging them favorably as unfavorably and to show quick progress in winning over undecideds. As Mr. Obama finally wrapped up the Democratic nomination in late spring of 2008, he was viewed favorably by 41 percent of Americans and unfavorably by 31 percent, with 27 percent undecided; by October he had pushed his favorability rating over 50 percent. (In 2000, both George W. Bush and Al Gore drove their favorability numbers higher during the period, setting up a battle that continued past Election Day.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">         The preconvention perception battle is especially intense this year. The conventions are late (the Democrats will not wrap up until after Labor Day), meaning the formal general election season will be relatively short. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">         Early voting effectively shortens it even more in many places; voters in many states will start casting ballots in early October, making the final weeks of the campaign moot for them. And with three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate scheduled for October, the candidates will find it harder to control the message in the campaign's closing stages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The period between now and the conventions in late summer is a critical one, particularly for a challenger who is lesser known,&quot; said David Axelrod, the strategist for Mr. Obama's campaign. &quot;This is the period during which people really begin to to focus and formulate opinions. Though the debates and the inevitable, unplanned development could still sway some, by  fall, impressions will be pretty hardened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">      All of which helps explain why both the Obama and Romney campaigns are so eager to get back on message this week. Mr. Obama's roll-out of his general election message last week was squashed when he was forced into taking a clear position on gay marriage. Mr. Romney, despite having been running for president more or less consistently since 2007, found his biographical narrative at risk of being altered in an unflattering way by a single news story. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">      Both candidates have experienced and hard-hitting campaign teams, and their relative success in taking control of the candidates' images in the next month or two could go a long way toward determining what happens on Nov. 6.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign often faults the president for concentrating on &quot;distractions&quot; (like whether same-sex couples deserve equal treatment under the law) instead of economic issues. Today the Obama campaign took the bait, releasing a two-minute ad that calls Mitt Romney a &quot;job destroyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, which will air in five battleground states, tells the story of GST Steel, a Kansas City plant that Bain Capital bought in 1993 and shuttered in 2001 after more than a century in operation - taking away more than 750 jobs. &nbsp;&quot;It was like a vampire,&quot; says one man. &quot;They came in and sucked the life out of us.&quot; &quot;It was like watching an old friend bleed to death,&quot; says another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By way of explanation, the Obama campaign released a statement alleging that &quot;Romney's business strategy wasn't about strengthening companies and creating jobs for long-term economic growth. It wasn't about investors and workers playing by the same set of rules, and it certainly wasn't about creating an economy built to last by rewarding hard work and responsibility and strengthening the security of middle-class families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may be asking yourself: ? You have. In January, a pro-Gingrich super PAC released an anti-Romney spot called &quot;King of Bain,&quot; which drew a distinction between the capitalism that makes America great, and Mr. Romney's special brand of predatory &quot;corporate raiding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney supporters are quick to note that Mr. Romney left Bain in 1999 to manage the Salt Lake City Olympics. That is, he left  GST's bankruptcy. That's perfectly true, but Mr. Romney regularly takes credit for jobs that Bain created after his tenure. He can't have it both ways. Either he accepts responsibility for job gains and job losses, or neither.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Rattner, the president's former car czar (and a contributor to our Op-Ed page), has also taken issue with the ad, calling it &quot;unfair.&quot; He said on MSNBC this morning: &quot;Bain Capital's responsibility was not to create 100,000 jobs or some other number. It was to create profits for its investors, most of whom were pension funds and endowments and foundations.   I don't think there's anything Bain Capital did that they need to be embarrassed about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a pretty damning defense. Mr. Romney's pitch to voters is that he knows how to create jobs; Mr. Rattner's saying he was never responsible for creating jobs, he was responsible for creating . There's a difference, and that's exactly what the &quot;job destroyer&quot; ad points out.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as Americans debate whether President Obama's health-care law and its promise of guaranteed health coverage should be scrapped, many far less affluent nations are moving in the opposite direction - to provide medical insurance to all citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China, after years of underfunding health care, is on track to complete a three-year, $124 billion initiative projected to cover more than 90 percent of the nation's residents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexico, which a decade ago covered less than half its population, completed an eight-year drive for universal coverage that has dramatically expanded Mexicans' access to life-saving treatments for diseases such as leukemia and breast cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Thailand, where the gross domestic product per person is one-fifth that of the United States, just 1 percent of the population lacks health insurance. And in sub-Saharan Africa, Rwanda and Ghana - two of the world's poorest nations - are working to create networks of insurance plans to cover their citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is truly a global movement,&quot; said Julio Frenk, a former health minister in Mexico and dean of the Harvard School of Public Health. &quot;As countries advance, they are realizing that creating universal health-care systems is a necessity for long-term economic development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many countries are struggling to improve the quality of their medical care. And making health care affordable remains a challenge for most countries, as it does for the United States, where about 15 percent of people lack coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the international drive to provide health care for everyone is leaving America behind. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are really an outlier,&quot; said David de Ferranti, a former World Bank vice president who heads the Results for Development Institute, an international nonprofit organization based in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That stands in stark contrast to the United States' historical leadership in education, he said. Long before most European countries, the United States ensured access to public schooling. Today, it is alone among the world's richest nations in not providing health-care coverage to all citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the new U.S. health law is scheduled to do that in 2014, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has promised to repeal it. Romney's alternative does not include any provision to guarantee coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two decades ago, many former communist countries in Eastern Europe and elsewhere dismantled their universal health-care systems amid a drive to set up free-market economies. But popular demand for insurance protection has fueled an effort in nearly all of these countries to rebuild their systems. Similar pressure is coming from the citizens of fast-growing nations in Asia and Latin America, where rising living standards have raised expectations for better services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some countries have set up public systems like those in Great Britain and Canada. But many others are relying on a mix of government and commercial insurance, as in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are demanding responses from their governments,&quot; said Cristian Baeza, the World Bank's director for health, nutrition and population. Indeed, in countries such as India, politicians have learned that one of the surest ways to secure votes is to promise better access to health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Chile, where free-market measures eroded the country's universal health system in the 1980s, a Socialist candidate won the presidency in 2000 for the first time in nearly 30 years on a promise to renew guaranteed health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Thai system, set up a decade ago, has survived years of political upheaval and a military coup. &quot;No party dares touch it,&quot; said Suwit Wibulpolprasert, a senior adviser to the Ministry of Public Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many political leaders around the world also have concluded that creating a system of universal health care is crucial to remaining competitive globally and sustaining economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese leaders were concerned that their citizens were saving excessively because there was no system to protect them if they got seriously ill, said Yanzhong Huang, director of the Center for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University. The high savings rate was restraining domestic demand for consumer items, making the economy overly dependent on selling goods abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mexico, political leaders were concerned that poor families were often forced to pull a child out of school or give up productive assets such as livestock or equipment to pay medical bills, said Frenk, the former health minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before embarking on its health-care push, the Mexican government found that 4 million people every year were being driven into bankruptcy by illness. &quot;That was a huge drag on the economy,&quot; Frenk said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Mexico's new government insurance plan - known as Seguro Popular - covers more than 50 million people, filling the gap left by the traditional health insurance system funded by payroll taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such steps don't eliminate all financial strain on households. Indeed, in many poor nations that are expanding health-care coverage, such as Vietnam and the Philippines, people still must pay most of their own medical bills, a sign of skimpy coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governments, too, feel the strain. Colombia's universal health-care system, set up in 1993, has cost more than twice what was expected, said Ramiro Guerrero, a former vice minister of health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, there is growing evidence that universal coverage is protecting millions of people worldwide from financial ruin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rwanda, researchers found that citizens who had joined one of the nation's health plans were nearly 75 percent less likely to be hit with a catastrophic health-care bill that threatened to bankrupt them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although the effect of broader coverage on overall health is still unclear, there are some signs that citizens of countries that are committed to guaranteeing health coverage are getting more treatment for serious illnesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama is planning to address Barnard College graduates Monday in a speech that is expected to target the women's vote. But on Sunday, both the president's and Mitt Romney's campaigns were actively courting that vote through videos tied to Mother's Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama speaks of the role that &quot;strong responsible women&quot; - Michelle Obama and his own mother, Ann Dunham - played in influencing his own life and that of his daughters. And the video ends with the president highlighting his support of the Lilly Ledbetter Act expanding workers' rights to sue in payroll discrimination cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign released a video that it said was produced by Mitt Romney's sons in tribute to their mother, Ann Romney. A campaign press release quotes Mrs. Romney saying, &quot;After watching this short video that my sons put together for me for Mother's Day, you'll see how my rowdy little boys turned into sweet, wonderful men.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's already been widely pointed out that the JPMorgan debacle badly weakens the position of people who want to limit further oversight of Wall Street or roll back the 2010 financial reform law and its attempt to limit risk-taking by banks that have guarantees from government. What's noted less often is that one of those people is the Republican candidate for president, who has pledged to repeal Dodd-Frank if elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that the JPMorgan loss raises tough questions for the Obama administration and the regulatory effectiveness of his Wall Street reform bill. But two Democratic senators who are trying to tighten up the law - Carl Levin (Mich.) and Jeff Merkley (Ore.) - also sought Friday to hang the debacle  directly around Romney's neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He favors repeal of Dodd-Frank,&quot; Levin said. &quot;He doesn't want derivatives regulated. He doesn't want banks like JPMorgan to be regulated at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The JPMorgan story shows Romney's position has been &quot;dramatically proven wrong,&quot; Levin continued, adding that repealing Dodd-Frank would &quot;remove the possibility that we would get a cop back on the beat on Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a case of interesting timing, given the JPMorgan news, Romney attacked Obama's regulatory policies on Friday, claiming that they &quot;scared the dickens&quot; out of banks and insurance companies. But when asked about JPMorgan in particular, the Romney campaign pushed back on any notion that the candidate favors complete deregulation, arguing that he favors &quot;common-sense&quot; regulations and oversight of the derivatives market. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The larger story, as the Boston Globe detailed recently, is that Romney says he would roll back Wall Street reform but won't say with any specificity what he'd replace it with. One expert said: &quot;He's asking for permission to govern the country - but he's saying, do away with the government's response to the Wall Street crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JPMorgan's news should sharpen the contrast between the two presidential candidates and gives new meaning to Romney's claim that he wants to &quot;get government out of the way&quot; and let the free market work its magic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You don't have to be Christian to know the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do to you. In fact, scholars note that it is the one precept common to all major faith traditions. But in his interview with ABC's Robin Roberts on Wednesday, President Obama cited the Golden Rule as found in Matthew 7:12 when describing the role his Christian faith played in leading him to support same-sex marriage.          &quot;When we think about our faith,&quot; he explained, &quot;the thing at root that we think about is not only Christ sacrificing himself on our behalf, but it's also the Golden Rule. . . . Treat others the way you would want to be treated.&quot;           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing to the nation that he thinks that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry wasn't the first time Obama has linked his Protestant beliefs to his support for specific policies. In his address at the National Prayer Breakfast this year, he credited his faith for inspiring policies as diverse as funding for medical research and eliminating tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. &quot;Living by the principle that we are our brother's keeper [and] caring for the poor and those in need,&quot; Obama said, are values &quot;that have defined my own faith journey.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American politics is rife with religious rhetoric - but in the modern era,  it has almost always been deployed on behalf of conservative positions. Religious communities helped rally support for the North Carolina ballot proposition prohibiting same-sex marriage and civil unions, which passed Tuesday. No less an evangelical icon than Billy Graham appeared in print ads statewide to urge its passage, under the message: &quot;The Bible is clear - God's definition of marriage is between a man and a woman.&quot; Liberal politicians, on the other hand, have tended to ground their positions in secular arguments, and often warned that Republicans were endangering the separation of church and state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama cited several reasons for his support for gay marriage, including conversations with U.S. troops, his family and his staff. But his assertion that his views on same-sex marriage come from - not despite - his Christian faith marks a shift in U.S. politics. Democratic politicians now unabashedly cite religion when making their case, and GOP leaders sometimes find themselves in the unusual position of justifying - rather than merely stating - their religious claims. That's something that House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has cited his Catholic faith as a basis for the massive spending cuts in his proposed budget, has learned recently. Politicians from both parties now make explicitly religious arguments for opposing positions.          There was a time not long ago when the discussion of religion in politics centered on liberal causes - think of the civil rights movement or opposition to the war in Vietnam. When the religious right exploded onto the political scene in the late 1970s, however, many Democrats concluded that the introduction of religion into political discussion was a conservative act.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they shied away from religious references, that assumption became self-fulfilling. By 2004, the meaning of words such as &quot;morality&quot; and &quot;Christianity&quot; had become so one-sided that exit polls for that year's presidential election used the phrase &quot;moral values&quot; as shorthand for a circumscribed category of conservative concerns such as opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage when asking what issues had most influenced voters' decisions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That exit poll question, as well as attacks on Democratic nominee John F. Kerry by Roman Catholic leaders for his support of abortion rights, inspired a collective epiphany among Democrats. They began to remind voters - and one another - that issues such as education, health care and protecting the environment reflected strongly held values as well. In 2006, Democrats won back control of Congress with the help of a new cast of candidates who spoke easily about their faith and beliefs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No group was more galvanized than Catholic Democrats, who were tired of Catholic leaders telling them they were bad Catholics or disinviting them from events at Catholic institutions. A group of young Catholic activists formed an organization called Catholics United, in part to hold politicians accountable on the issues they saw Catholic leaders largely ignoring. In 2007, they ran ads on Christian radio in the districts of members of Congress who opposed abortion and voted against the State Children's Health Insurance Program. &quot;He says he's pro-life, but for the second time in a month he's voted against health-care for kids,&quot; said the ad's female narrator. &quot;That's not pro-life.&quot;           Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) is another Catholic who has been frustrated by the fact that although Church leaders criticize her votes on abortion legislation, they remain silent about her Republican Catholic colleagues who deviate from church teaching on other issues. Last month, DeLauro made public a letter she sent to Cardinal Timothy Dolan, head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, calling on him to &quot;personally address the devastating impact of this [GOP] budget.&quot;           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops are usually swift to speak out regarding budget documents. But this year they have been preoccupied by a campaign for religious freedom in response to the Obama administration's mandate that health insurance cover contraception. They had remained silent about the GOP budget. Embarrassed by DeLauro's missive, the USCCB released several letters stating opposition to the budget - one called proposed cuts &quot;unjustified and wrong&quot; - four days later. Nearly all of the Republican congressional leaders are Catholic, and they have been made particularly uncomfortable by the resurgence of an active Catholic opposition on the left. Last year, the head of Catholics United approached Ryan with a Bible and asked him to spend more time reading the Book of Matthew than Ayn Rand, who Ryan has said inspired him to enter public service. Video cameras captured Ryan awkwardly speed-walking away from the proffered Bible and into a waiting SUV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Just in the past month, Ryan has attempted to explain how Catholic social teaching shaped his budget, only to have nearly 100 faculty members at Georgetown University sign a letter taking issue with his interpretation before a scheduled speech at the Catholic campus. And both he and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) have stumbled in response to the bishops' criticism of the GOP budget. Ryan first tried to insist that the bishops' letters represented the views of just a few people (they were in fact elected to represent the other bishops). And Boehner dismissed the bishops' concerns, saying they needed to take &quot;a bigger look&quot; at the issue.           This new bipartisan politics of religion is a good thing - both for religion and for politics. For several decades, the right has held a monopoly over what it means to be religious in the United States, not to mention Christian or evangelical. The result has been devastating for the image of Christianity. When the Barna Group polled Americans ages 16 to 29 on what words best describe Christianity, the top response was &quot;anti-homosexual.&quot; The other common associations were &quot;judgmental,&quot; &quot;hypocritical&quot; and &quot;too involved in politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has not helped that for years, conservative politicians have explained their opposition to gay rights by simply stating, &quot;I'm a Christian,&quot; as if that automatically requires one to abhor the idea of same-sex marriage. Recent debates about the protection of religious freedom have assumed that the only religious motives that count are conservative ones. That's the concept at the core of arguments about the contraception mandate, as well as a number of religious freedom bills moving through state legislatures. Enthusiasm for those efforts might well flag if religious progressives were to demand protection for their beliefs as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our politics benefit from including more religious perspectives. When politicians are forced to   say how their faith informs their policies - instead of just citing it as part of their political identity - it becomes more difficult to use religion as a blanket explanation for a partisan stance. Instead of asserting that his budget is shaped by his Catholicism, Ryan has to delve into the tradition of Catholic social teaching. Boehner has to explain why he thinks the U.S. bishops are wrong to criticize the budget. And Obama will inevitably have to take on the charges from conservative Christians who are already calling his linkage of the Golden Rule and support for same-sex marriage &quot;an appalling blasphemy.&quot; Indeed, one of his own spiritual advisers - evangelical pastor Joel Hunter - says he is &quot;disappointed&quot; by Obama's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          After years of pretending that the culture wars were a matter of religious views lined up against secular beliefs, politicians are recognizing what average Americans knew all along. A majority of Americans now believe that there is more than one way to get to heaven, pollsters report. Our political discussions finally reflect that there's also more than one answer to the question: &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot;                       thepartyfaithful@gmail.com          </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">&quot;Under President Obama: Julia retires. After years of contributing to Social Security, she receives monthly benefits that help her retire comfortably, without worrying that she'll run out of savings. This allows her to volunteer at a community garden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">&quot;Under Mitt Romney: Julia's benefits could be cut by 40%.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">- Text from Obama campaign's &quot;Life of Julia&quot; infographic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign's _blank&quot;Life of Julia&quot; infographic is a fascinating attempt by President Obama to demonstrate the real-life consequences of political choices - to show how the various bills passed by Congress and signed into law by the president can affect individuals.          Already, a philosophical dispute has erupted as to whether the story of Julia demonstrates that Democrats believe people must rely on the government for help from cradle to grave. We will leave that question to the pundits.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also will not dive deeply into some of the assertions in this graphic. Much of it relies on assumptions about the House Republican budget, and because it has not spelled out spending cuts in detail - like all congressional budget resolutions - the Obama campaign simply assumes an across-the-board 20 percent cut in domestic spending. You also have to believe that Republican Mitt Romney would rubber-stamp everything in that budget if he became president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we will examine the claim about Social Security because it is a good example of a campaign trick of comparing specifics versus an unrealistic perfect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The _blankmost recent Social Security trustees report says that, under intermediate assumptions, the Social Security trust fund will be exhausted in 2033, which would result in a 23 percent reduction in benefits if Congress and future administrations do not deal with the shortfall. This is three years earlier than last year's report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sounds a bit worse than it should, because politicians will not let Social Security funding fall off a cliff. In fact, many experts believe the funding problems can be solved with some tinkering instead of dramatic changes. But, by all accounts, something will need to be done to keep Social Security fully funded for the next 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama recognized this during his debt-ceiling talks with House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). According to _blankan account in the New York Times magazine, the president offered to accept &quot;a new, less generous formula for calculating Social Security benefits.&quot;           The article was not specific, but &quot;less generous formula&quot; probably refers to changing _blankcost-of-living adjustments in Social Security benefits from a wage-linked inflation index to a _blankslower growing consumer price index. Generally, most people would perceive this as a benefit cut, which is certainly _blankhow liberal groups reacted when the possibility arose during the debt-ceiling talks.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, back to the &quot;Life of Julia&quot; infographic. Note how carefully the Obama campaign's statement is worded. It says that, under Obama, Julia &quot;receives monthly benefits that help her retire comfortably.&quot; It does not promise that projected benefits will not be cut, but it certainly implies that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And how does the Obama campaign figure that Romney, by contrast, has Social Security proposals that &quot;could&quot; cut benefits by 40 percent? The campaign assumes that Romney's plan is similar to a plan advanced by three Republican senators, who proposed raising the retirement age and reducing benefits for high-wage earners - _blankproposals embraced by Romney.The Social Security actuary _blankevaluated the senators' plan and found it could cut benefits by 40 percent for high-wage earners by 2050.  However, the analysis also found that, with these changes, Social Security benefits could continue to be paid through 2084. Some might _blankargue that the proposals are rather drastic. Still, if nothing is done, there won't be enough money to pay full benefits under the current system by 2033.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          In any case, Eric Fehrnstrom, a Romney senior adviser, argues that the actuary's analysis of the senators' plan cannot be applied to the Romney proposal because although it is &quot;structurally similar . . . we have not specified the exact thresholds for the means-testing of Social Security.&quot;           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the game that both campaigns like to play. The Obama campaign is trying to nail Romney with specifics, while avoiding them for itself, just as the Romney campaign is trying to dodge the specific implications of its proposals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Romney is proposing a cut in benefits for high-wage earners, candidate Obama in 2008 also targeted high-wage earners as a way to extend Social Security's solvency, _blankproposing a payroll tax increase on people making more than $250,000. Then and now, Obama opposes any increase in the retirement age, so that is a real point of contention between the two candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          The Pinocchio Test          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This frame of the &quot;Life of Julia&quot; series is fairly misleading. If Obama does something to improve the solvency of Social Security, benefits are likely to be cut in some fashion. If Obama - and future presidents - do nothing, benefits will also be cut. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign could have chosen to fight Romney with specifics - such as saying that Julia could retire as scheduled, without fear of an increase in her retirement age - but instead it chose to compare a version of Romney's proposals with a potentially unrealistic outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Life of Julia,&quot; the Obama campaign's new interactive Web ad, follows a cartoon everywoman, Julia, through the milestones of a middle-class American life: education, work, motherhood, retirement. One milestone is pointedly missing: marriage.           But, then again, why should Julia get married? She doesn't need to. Like a growing number of single women with children, Julia is married to the state.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a character drawn and focus-grouped by political consultants, Julia is designed to remind voters of the government programs President Obama champions and likely GOP nominee Mitt Romney is ostensibly intent on taking away. Julia goes to school (with help from Headstart and federal student loans), she works (thank you, Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and Small Business Administration), she has a son (free health screenings brought to her by Obamacare) and she retires (Social Security and Medicare pay the bills while she volunteers in a community garden). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Julia is a more artful and nuanced creation than a simple tour guide to the utopia that awaits under a second Obama term. She is designed to appeal to a narrow but deep demographic: single women, especially single women with kids.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2007, the United States passed a significant demographic milestone, when the census reported that the majority of American households were headed by unmarried people. It was the crest of a wave that had been building for some time. Since 1960, the percentage of the population that is over age 15 and unmarried increased from 32 percent to 45 percent. If this trend continues, singles (including unmarried people who are cohabiting) will make up the majority of Americans in less than 15 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in this nation of swinging singles, women are dominant. Because women live longer than men, there are about 10 million more single women than single men, and their ranks are growing. While the number of voting-eligible married women grew by 7 percent between 2000 and 2010, the number of voting-eligible single women increased by 19 percent. This election year, unmarried voting-eligible women are estimated to number 55 million, more than 25 percent of the voting-eligible population. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's that word - &quot;eligible&quot; - that Democrats are focused on. Although polls show that married women favor Romney over Obama, unmarried women are the most reliably Democratic voting group outside African Americans. They constituted a whopping 71-to-29 percent majority for Obama in 2008, earning them a place in what Democrats call their &quot;rising American electorate&quot;  - the people of color, the young and the unmarried women who helped deliver the presidency for Obama in 2008, and who Democrats desperately want back in 2012.           The problem is, the rising American electorate is a reliable Democratic vote only when it bothers to register and show up. And even though they show a current 44-point preference for Obama, unmarried women - especially those with children - register and vote at lower rates than married women.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The turnout of unmarried women is so unreliable that, until the 2000 presidential election, Democrats generally wrote off the single female vote as not worth the effort. But in that razor-thin contest, strategists noticed for the first time that 22 million members of their most reliable cohort of voters did not go to the polls. If single women had cast ballots in the same proportions as married women, Al Gore probably would have received the punched chads of an additional 6 million voters, more than enough to have won him the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party's answer to this missed opportunity has been to attempt to make singlehood cool and fresh and new in an attempt to court this demographic. When focus groups told them that unmarried women regard the word &quot;single&quot; as a depressing term, strategists renamed them simply &quot;unmarried&quot; or, even better, &quot;women on their own.&quot; When strategists such as Ann Lewis, a longtime adviser to Hillary Rodham Clinton, tried to call them &quot;Single Anxious Females,&quot; liberal pundits quickly countered with more palatable evocations of &quot;Sex and the City voters.&quot;                     Julia is just the latest makeover. She is the Democrats' answer to Romney's family Christmas card. A nation of women on their own, after all, doesn't relate very well to fecund portraits of smiling white moms and dads with kids and golden retrievers underfoot. With her spare, faceless affect, Julia is meant to evoke a more modern, independent sensibility - with the exception of her life of endless government dependency, that is.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julia is Mary Tyler Moore on the government's dime. You're gonna make it after all, Julia! Just remember who's responsible on Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is, like so much of our political rhetoric, Julia is not a composite; she's a myth. Some of the nation's single moms may be successful Web designers, but many are poor - fully half have incomes of less than $30,000 a year, compared with just 15 percent of married women. It's not Pell grants and SBA loans these women rely on but Medicaid and food stamps. And it's not comfortable retirements in community gardens they contemplate but bleak old age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas government benefits were once  the state's compassionate response to women who had lost their husbands, in Julia's world they are the unquestionable entitlement of women who never married. The decline of marriage and Democratic political opportunism have combined to transform what used to be a situation to be avoided - single motherhood - into a new and proud American demographic, citizens of Obama's Hubby State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gone is any acknowledgment that remaining single is a less than ideal situation for women - or for men, for that matter - or that raising children outside of marriage is anything less than these women's inalienable personal choice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategists talk breathlessly of unmarried women becoming for the Democratic Party what evangelical Christians are for the Republicans: a large, awakened, reliable force for liberal social change. And for good reason. Women, as a group, look more approvingly  on government social welfare programs and domestic spending than men do. A recent Pew Research Center poll  showed that women favor a more activist government than men by double digits - a finding consistent since at least 2000. Higher percentages of women say government doesn't do enough for the elderly, children and the poor. Women endorse more government regulation of the workplace and the environment. Six in 10 women say that helping the poor and needy should be the highest priority of government, compared with 46 percent of men. And when you consider only single women with kids, and this gap widens even further. The Democratic project to coax single women to the polls is given urgency by an interesting political fact: Although single women vote overwhelmingly Democratic, their condition is not permanent. According to the work of University of Chicago demographer Tom Smith, once divorced people remarry, they start to vote like married people again. In 2004, George W. Bush had a 12-point advantage over John Kerry among married people. Kerry won divorced voters by three points and separated and never-married voters by 35 percent and 25 percent, respectively. But among remarried voters, Bush was back on top by 15 percent. It seems something about the institution of marriage makes people vote Republican.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Julia - like the trumped-up GOP &quot;war on women&quot; - is part of a Democratic get-out-the-vote effort aimed at single women. Boldly and openly, unmarried American women are being encouraged to substitute a relationship with a spouse for one with the state. The consequences of this choice are great, and they're not insignificant for the rest of us, either. After all, a husband who's a plumber can't raise our taxes. A husband who's the government can, especially if you want him to help out more raising the kids.          </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             CORAL GABLES, Fla. - Here in the land of hanging chads, where a recent poll shows the presidential race in a dead heat, you might expect incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson to be feeling some reelection pressure.          Instead, during the latest congressional recess, the courtly two-term senator and former astronaut met with college students, held a tiny news conference to tout a crackdown on identity theft and hosted a business roundtable in Cocoa Beach. There were no campaign rallies. No stump speeches, no scurrying across the huge state in search of the quintessential swing voters.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of Nelson's leisurely pace can be explained by the fact that Florida Republicans will be occupied for months longer with a nasty and expensive primary. The rest of the explanation may be that even some Republicans are starting to believe that whoever emerges from the GOP primary fight may be too seriously flawed to put up the kind of campaign that would threaten Nelson's bid for a third term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This race should be much more competitive than I think it is or will be,&quot; said Chris Ingram, a GOP consultant from Tampa. &quot;We'll be calling him 'senator' for another six years. . . . He keeps getting the JV's third squad as opponents.&quot;          Challengers at the ready           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading the list of Nelson's possible opponents are Rep. Connie Mack, a four-term congressman with a stellar name but a checkered past, and George S. LeMieux, who earned high marks from Republicans by briefly serving Florida as a U.S. senator but who may be unable to shed his unhelpful ties to the man who appointed him to that job, former Republican governor Charlie Crist.           In addition, Nelson is sitting on $9.5 million in campaign cash, far more than any of his potential Republican challengers. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has announced it has so far booked ad time in six states, a sign of its top targets. Florida was not among them.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP's dilemma, in Florida of all places, explains in part why the path to a new Republican majority in the Senate is now looking trickier than it appeared after the party emphatically swept the House in 2010.A late March poll showed Nelson with an eight-point edge, a shift from polls in January and November that showed a nearly even race. Nelson's edge has widened even as polls have showed a tightening race in Florida at the presidential level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson's Republican opponents insist he is hobbled by his ties to President Obama and is deeply exposed in a state where the economy has been especially weak. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Nelson is very vulnerable because he continues to side with Obama over the desires of the people of the state of Florida,&quot; said Mack, the son of highly respected former Florida senator. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mack, the great-grandson of a baseball Hall of Famer and the husband of Rep. Mary Bono Mack (R-Calif.), has been building up steam in the nomination race against lesser-known Republicans LeMieux and Mike McCalister, a former Army colonel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has picked up endorsements from fellow members of Congress and former Florida attorney general Bill McCollum. He's raising money faster than LeMieux and, in a near endorsement, Mitt Romney, the party's presumed presidential candidate, once announced him at an event as the state's next senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mack's introduction to the world of statewide politics has been rocky at best and has had national Republicans fretting that the road to the Senate majority will have to wind through states other than Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one thing, there's Mack's colorful past, which has unspooled since he entered the race in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Mack has served in Congress since 2005 and was in Florida's statehouse before that, LeMieux has mocked him for an earlier stint as an executive for the Florida-based restaurant chain Hooters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also has highlighted Mack's involvement in two bar fights and two road-rage incidents when he was in his 20s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And aggressive state media have found evidence that Mack, 44, now running on promises to restore fiscal discipline to Washington, struggled to pay bills during a divorce in 2005; he says the troubles were quickly resolved when the matter was settled.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he's the nominee, he'll lose. Because it will become a character contest and Connie Mack can't win a character contest with anyone,&quot; said LeMieux, who has labeled Mack the Charlie Sheen of Florida politics. LeMieux said his biggest challenge will be to convince voters that Mack is not the same as his highly regarded father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mack said LeMieux's attacks on his past will be dismissed by voters as election-year mudslinging, the complaints of a &quot;desperate candidate.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that is the narrative that people are trying to create,&quot; Mack said of reports of Republican worry. &quot;But it's not what we're hearing or feeling on the ground in Florida. We've got a lot of momentum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mack may benefit from some level of backlash among conservatives who think they compromised too much at the top of the ticket in the name of electability. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">          Conservative backing          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mack has the support of the Tea Party of Florida, a registered third party, whose leaders  say he is the most fiscally conservative option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our members are mad as they can be about how Herman Cain was treated,&quot; said John Long, chairman of the Tea Party of Florida, which had been preparing to endorse Cain when he dropped out of the presidential race after allegations about his personal life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They feel cheated by that process. They seem absolutely adamant that it won't happen again. But if it does happen, they don't want to be a part of it,&quot; Long said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mack's problems extend beyond a long-ago misspent youth. He bobbled a central bit of Republican messaging earlier this year - telling a tea party forum in Orlando that he believed a budget plan written by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and embraced by the party as a responsible path to fiscal sanity was a &quot;joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later his campaign said he supported Ryan's efforts but believed the plan took too long to bring the national budget into balance. In a recent interview, he said he would have voted against the plan had he been in Washington to do so. His absence for the key vote because of campaigning has been another point of contention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I  go back and forth,&quot; he said. &quot;I probably would have voted no. There are a lot of reforms that I like. But I have a problem with the idea that this budget is not going to balance for 28 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a late start to the race means his coffers are thin - he raised about $1 million last quarter, but he has burned through cash quickly. He now has just $1.3 million on hand to fight a tough primary and then battle Nelson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Florida political science professor Daniel Smith said the cumulative effect has been to leave Republicans wondering if they can &quot;trust Connie Mack to be a serious adult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mack's dicey start would seem to create an opening for LeMieux, who served 16 months in the Senate after the resignation of Sen. Mel Martinez (R) in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Crist's former chief of staff and longtime confidant, he is saddled with the former governor's apostasy of abandoning the party in 2010 and running for the Senate as an independent.That's an especially difficult conundrum in a party whose grass roots have become suspicious of their leaders, convinced they often say one thing to get elected but act differently in office. LeMieux raised less than a third of Mack's haul last quarter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican establishment hasn't really embraced either of these guys - they seem pretty unimpressed,&quot; Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as Mack and LeMieux bloody each other, Nelson has been free so far to stay above the fray.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have always said that the best politics is just to try to do a good job. And while they're all concentrating on themselves, I'm going to continue trying to do a good job,&quot; he said after a recent event in Coral Gables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether the Republicans would make tough opponents, he merely smiled and said he would take on an opponent after one is chosen in the August primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's just wait and see,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Romney's Wall Street problem </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dodd-Frank Act, the Wall Street reform bill that President Obama signed into law after the worst financial crisis in decades, has had a relatively low profile in the presidential race. Obama frequently argues that Mitt Romney would deregulate Wall Street and leave it to its own devices, but Dodd-Frank hasn't been as central a topic to the campaign as, say, Obamacare has been. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news of JPMorgan Chase's  $2 billion trading loss could change that very quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's already been widely pointed out that the JPMorgan debacle badly weakens the position of people who want to limit further oversight of Wall Street or roll back the 2010 financial reform law and its attempt to limit risk-taking by banks that have guarantees from government. What's noted less often is that one of those people is the Republican candidate for president, who has pledged to repeal Dodd-Frank if elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that the JPMorgan loss raises tough questions for the Obama administration and the regulatory effectiveness of his Wall Street reform bill. But two Democratic senators who are trying to tighten up the law - Carl Levin (Mich.) and Jeff Merkley (Ore.) - also sought Friday to hang the debacle  directly around Romney's neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He favors repeal of Dodd-Frank,&quot; Levin said. &quot;He doesn't want derivatives regulated. He doesn't want banks like JPMorgan to be regulated at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The JPMorgan story shows Romney's position has been &quot;dramatically proven wrong,&quot; Levin continued, adding that repealing Dodd-Frank would &quot;remove the possibility that we would get a cop back on the beat on Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a case of interesting timing, given the JPMorgan news, Romney attacked Obama's regulatory policies on Friday, claiming that they &quot;scared the dickens&quot; out of banks and insurance companies. But when asked about JPMorgan in particular, the Romney campaign pushed back on any notion that the candidate favors complete deregulation, arguing that he favors &quot;common-sense&quot; regulations and oversight of the derivatives market. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The larger story, as the Boston Globe detailed recently, is that Romney says he would roll back Wall Street reform but won't say with any specificity what he'd replace it with. One expert said: &quot;He's asking for permission to govern the country - but he's saying, do away with the government's response to the Wall Street crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JPMorgan's news should sharpen the contrast between the two presidential candidates and gives new meaning to Romney's claim that he wants to &quot;get government out of the way&quot; and let the free market work its magic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Life of Julia,&quot; the Obama campaign's new interactive Web ad, follows a cartoon everywoman, Julia, through the milestones of a middle-class American life: education, work, motherhood, retirement. One milestone is pointedly missing: marriage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, then again, why should Julia get married? She doesn't need to. Like a growing number of single women with children, Julia is married to the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a character drawn and focus-grouped by political consultants, Julia is designed to remind voters of the government programs President Obama champions and likely GOP nominee Mitt Romney is ostensibly intent on taking away. Julia goes to school (with help from Headstart and federal student loans), she works (thank you, Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Actand Small Business Administration), she has a son (free health screenings brought to her by Obamacare) and she retires (Social Security and Medicare pay the bills while she volunteers in a community garden). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Julia is a more artful and nuanced creation than a simple tour guide to the utopia that awaits under a second Obama term. She is designed to appeal to a narrow but deep demographic: single women, especially single women with kids.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2007, the United States passed a significant demographic milestone, when the census reported that the majority of American households were headed by unmarried people. It was the crest of a wave that had been building for some time. Since 1960, the percentage of the population that is over age 15 and unmarried increased from 32 percent to 45 percent. If this trend continues, singles (including unmarried people who are cohabiting) will make up the majority of Americans in less than 15 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in this nation of swinging singles, women are dominant. Because women live longer than men, there are about 10 million more single women than single men, and their ranks are growing. While the number of voting-eligible married women grew by 7 percent between 2000 and 2010, the number of voting-eligible single women increased by 19 percent. This election year, unmarried voting-eligible women are estimated to number 55 million, more than 25 percent of the voting-eligible population. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's that word - &quot;eligible&quot; - that Democrats are focused on. Although polls show that married women favor Romney over Obama, unmarried women are the most reliably Democratic voting group outside African Americans. They constituted a whopping 71-to-29 percent majority for Obama in 2008, earning them a place in what Democrats call their &quot;rising American electorate&quot;  - the people of color, the young and the unmarried women who helped deliver the presidency for Obama in 2008, and who Democrats desperately want back in 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is, the rising American electorate is a reliable Democratic vote only when it bothers to register and show up. And even though they show a current 44-point preference for Obama, unmarried women - especially those with children - register and vote at lower rates than married women. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The turnout of unmarried women is so unreliable that, until the 2000 presidential election, Democrats generally wrote off the single female vote as not worth the effort. But in that razor-thin contest, strategists noticed for the first time that 22 million members of their most reliable cohort of voters did not go to the polls. If single women had cast ballots in the same proportions as married women, Al Gore probably would have received the punched chads of an additional 6 million voters, more than enough to have won him the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party's answer to this missed opportunity has been to attempt to make singlehood cool and fresh and new in an attempt to court this demographic. When focus groups told them that unmarried women regard the word &quot;single&quot; as a depressing term, strategists renamed them simply &quot;unmarried&quot; or, even better, &quot;women on their own.&quot; When strategists such as Ann Lewis, a longtime adviser to Hillary Rodham Clinton, tried to call them &quot;Single Anxious Females,&quot; liberal pundits quickly countered with more palatable evocations of &quot;Sex and the City voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julia is just the latest makeover. She is the Democrats' answer to Romney's family Christmas card. A nation of women on their own, after all, doesn't relate very well to fecund portraits of smiling white moms and dads with kids and golden retrievers underfoot. With her spare, faceless affect, Julia is meant to evoke a more modern, independent sensibility - with the exception of her life of endless government dependency, that is. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julia is Mary Tyler Moore on the government's dime. You're gonna make it after all, Julia! Just remember who's responsible on Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is, like so much of our political rhetoric, Julia is not a composite; she's a myth. Some of the nation's single moms may be successful Web designers, but many are poor - fully half have incomes of less than $30,000 a year, compared with just 15 percent of married women. It's not Pell grants and SBA loans these women rely on but Medicaid and food stamps. And it's not comfortable retirements in community gardens they contemplate but bleak old age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas government benefits were once  the state's compassionate response to women who had lost their husbands, in Julia's world they are the unquestionable entitlement of women who never married. The decline of marriage and Democratic political opportunism have combined to transform what used to be a situation to be avoided - single motherhood - into a new and proud American demographic, citizens of Obama's Hubby State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gone is any acknowledgment that remaining single is a less than ideal situation for women - or for men, for that matter - or that raising children outside of marriage is anything less than these women's inalienable personal choice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategists talk breathlessly of unmarried women becoming for the Democratic Party what evangelical Christians are for the Republicans: a large, awakened, reliable force for liberal social change. And for good reason. Women, as a group, look more approvingly  on government social welfare programs and domestic spending than men do. A recent Pew Research Center pollshowed that women favor a more activist government than men by double digits - a finding consistent since at least 2000. Higher percentages of women say government doesn't do enough for the elderly, children and the poor. Women endorse more government regulation of the workplace and the environment. Six in 10 women say that helping the poor and needy should be the highest priority of government, compared with 46 percent of men. And when you consider only single women with kids, and this gap widens even further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic project to coax single women to the polls is given urgency by an interesting political fact: Although single women vote overwhelmingly Democratic, their condition is not permanent. According to the work of University of Chicago demographer Tom Smith, once divorced people remarry, they start to vote like married people again. In 2004, George W. Bush had a 12-point advantage over John Kerry among married people. Kerry won divorced voters by three points and separated and never-married voters by 35 percent and 25 percent, respectively. But among remarried voters, Bush was back on top by 15 percent. It seems something about the institution of marriage makes people vote Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julia - like the trumped-up GOP &quot;war on women&quot; - is part of a Democratic get-out-the-vote effort aimed at single women. Boldly and openly, unmarried American women are being encouraged to substitute a relationship with a spouse for one with the state. The consequences of this choice are great, and they're not insignificant for the rest of us, either. After all, a husband who's a plumber can't raise our taxes. A husband who's the government can, especially if you want him to help out more raising the kids.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CORAL GABLES, FLA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CORAL GABLES, Fla. - Here in the land of hanging chads, wherea recent poll shows the presidential race in a dead heat, you might expect incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson to be feeling some reelection pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, during the latest congressional recess, the courtly two-term senator and former astronaut met with college students, held a tiny news conference to tout a crackdown on identity theft and hosted a business roundtable in Cocoa Beach. There were no campaign rallies. No stump speeches, no scurrying across the huge state in search of the quintessential swing voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of Nelson's leisurely pace can be explained by the fact that Florida Republicans will be occupied for months longer with a nasty and expensive primary. The rest of the explanation may be that even some Republicans are starting to believe that whoever emerges from the GOP primary fight may be too seriously flawed to put up the kind of campaign that would threaten Nelson's bid for a third term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This race should be much more competitive than I think it is or will be,&quot; said Chris Ingram, a GOP consultant from Tampa. &quot;We'll be calling him 'senator' for another six years. . . . He keeps getting the JV's third squad as opponents.&quot; <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Challengers at the ready</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading the list of Nelson's possible opponents are Rep. Connie Mack, a four-term congressman with a stellar name but a checkered past, and George S. LeMieux, who earned high marks from Republicans by briefly serving Florida as a U.S. senator but who may be unable to shed his unhelpful ties to the man who appointed him to that job, former Republican governor Charlie Crist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Nelson is sitting on $9.5 million in campaign cash, far more than any of his potential Republican challengers. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has announced it has so far booked ad time in six states, a sign of its top targets. Florida was not among them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP's dilemma, in Florida of all places, explains in part why the path to a new Republican majority in the Senate is now looking trickier than it appeared after the party emphatically swept the House in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A late March poll showed Nelson with an eight-point edge, a shift from polls in January and November that showed a nearly even race. Nelson's edge has widened even as polls have showed a tightening race in Florida at the presidential level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson's Republican opponents insist he is hobbled by his ties to President Obama and is deeply exposed in a state where the economy has been especially weak. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Nelson is very vulnerable because he continues to side with Obama over the desires of the people of the state of Florida,&quot; said Mack, the son of highly respected former Florida senator. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mack, the great-grandson of a baseball Hall of Famer and the husband of Rep. Mary Bono Mack (R-Calif.), has been building up steam in the nomination race against lesser-known Republicans LeMieux and Mike McCalister, a former Army colonel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has picked up endorsements from fellow members of Congress and former Florida attorney general Bill McCollum. He's raising money faster than LeMieux and, in a near endorsement, Mitt Romney, the party's presumed presidential candidate, once announced him at an event as the state's next senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mack's introduction to the world of statewide politics has been rocky at best and has had national Republicans fretting that the road to the Senate majority will have to wind through states other than Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one thing, there's Mack's colorful past, which has unspooled since he entered the race in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Mack has served in Congress since 2005 and was in Florida's statehouse before that, LeMieux has mocked him for an earlier stint as an executive for the Florida-based restaurant chain Hooters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also has highlighted Mack's involvement in two bar fights and two road-rage incidents when he was in his 20s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And aggressive state media have found evidence that Mack, 44, now running on promises to restore fiscal discipline to Washington, struggled to pay bills during a divorce in 2005; he says the troubles were quickly resolved when the matter was settled.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he's the nominee, he'll lose. Because it will become a character contest and Connie Mack can't win a character contest with anyone,&quot; said LeMieux, who has labeled Mack the Charlie Sheen of Florida politics. LeMieux said his biggest challenge will be to convince voters that Mack is not the same as his highly regarded father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mack said LeMieux's attacks on his past will be dismissed by voters as election-year mudslinging, the complaints of a &quot;desperate candidate.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that is the narrative that people are trying to create,&quot; Mack said of reports of Republican worry. &quot;But it's not what we're hearing or feeling on the ground in Florida. We've got a lot of momentum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mack may benefit from some level of backlash among conservatives who think they compromised too much at the top of the ticket in the name of electability. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Conservative backing</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mack has the support of the Tea Party of Florida, a registered third party, whose leaders  say he is the most fiscally conservative option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our members are mad as they can be about how Herman Cain was treated,&quot; said John Long, chairman of the Tea Party of Florida, which had been preparing to endorse Cain when he dropped out of the presidential race after allegations about his personal life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They feel cheated by that process. They seem absolutely adamant that it won't happen again. But if it does happen, they don't want to be a part of it,&quot; Long said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mack's problems extend beyond a long-ago misspent youth. He bobbled a central bit of Republican messaging earlier this year - telling a tea party forum in Orlando that he believed a budget plan written by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and embraced by the party as a responsible path to fiscal sanity was a &quot;joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later his campaign said he supported Ryan's efforts but believed the plan took too long to bring the national budget into balance. In a recent interview, he said he would have voted against the plan had he been in Washington to do so. His absence for the key vote because of campaigning has been another point of contention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I  go back and forth,&quot; he said. &quot;I probably would have voted no. There are a lot of reforms that I like. But I have a problem with the idea that this budget is not going to balance for 28 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a late start to the race means his coffers are thin - he raised about $1 million last quarter, but he has burned through cash quickly. He now has just $1.3 million on hand to fight a tough primary and then battle Nelson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Florida political science professor Daniel Smith said the cumulative effect has been to leave Republicans wondering if they can &quot;trust Connie Mack to be a serious adult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mack's dicey start would seem to create an opening for LeMieux, who served 16 months in the Senate after the resignation of Sen. Mel Martinez (R) in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Crist's former chief of staff and longtime confidant, he is saddled with the former governor's apostasy of abandoning the party in 2010 and running for the Senate as an independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's an especially difficult conundrum in a party whose grass roots have become suspicious of their leaders, convinced they often say one thing to get elected but act differently in office. LeMieux raised less than a third of Mack's haul last quarter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republican establishment hasn't really embraced either of these guys - they seem pretty unimpressed,&quot; Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as Mack and LeMieux bloody each other, Nelson has been free so far to stay above the fray.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have always said that the best politics is just to try to do a good job. And while they're all concentrating on themselves, I'm going to continue trying to do a good job,&quot; he said after a recent event in Coral Gables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether the Republicans would make tough opponents, he merely smiled and said he would take on an opponent after one is chosen in the August primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's just wait and see,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under President Obama: Julia retires. After years of contributing to Social Security, she receives monthly benefits that help her retire comfortably, without worrying that she'll run out of savings. This allows her to volunteer at a community garden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under Mitt Romney: Julia's benefits could be cut by 40%.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Text from Obama campaign's &quot;Life of Julia&quot; infographic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign's _blank&quot;Life of Julia&quot; infographic is a fascinating attempt by President Obama to demonstrate the real-life consequences of political choices - to show how the various bills passed by Congress and signed into law by the president can affect individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, a philosophical dispute has erupted as to whether the story of Julia demonstrates that Democrats believe people must rely on the government for help from cradle to grave. We will leave that question to the pundits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also will not dive deeply into some of the assertions in this graphic. Much of it relies on assumptions about the House Republican budget, and because it has not spelled out spending cuts in detail - like all congressional budget resolutions - the Obama campaign simply assumes an across-the-board 20 percent cut in domestic spending. You also have to believe that Republican Mitt Romney would rubber-stamp everything in that budget if he became president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we will examine the claim about Social Security because it is a good example of a campaign trick of comparing specifics versus an unrealistic perfect. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The Facts</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The _blankmost recent Social Security trustees report says that, under intermediate assumptions, the Social Security trust fund will be exhausted in 2033, which would result in a 23 percent reduction in benefits if Congress and future administrations do not deal with the shortfall. This is three years earlier than last year's report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sounds a bit worse than it should, because politicians will not let Social Security funding fall off a cliff. In fact, many experts believe the funding problems can be solved with some tinkering instead of dramatic changes. But, by all accounts, something will need to be done to keep Social Security fully funded for the next 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama recognized this during his debt-ceiling talks with House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). According to _blankan account in the New York Times magazine, the president offered to accept &quot;a new, less generous formula for calculating Social Security benefits.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article was not specific, but &quot;less generous formula&quot; probably refers to changing _blankcost-of-living adjustments in Social Security benefits from a wage-linked inflation index to a _blankslower growing consumer price index. Generally, most people would perceive this as a benefit cut, which is certainly _blankhow liberal groups reacted when the possibility arose during the debt-ceiling talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, back to the &quot;Life of Julia&quot; infographic. Note how carefully the Obama campaign's statement is worded. It says that, under Obama, Julia &quot;receives monthly benefits that help her retire comfortably.&quot; It does not promise that projected benefits will not be cut, but it certainly implies that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And how does the Obama campaign figure that Romney, by contrast, has Social Security proposals that &quot;could&quot; cut benefits by 40 percent? The campaign assumes that Romney's plan is similar to a plan advanced by three Republican senators, who proposed raising the retirement age and reducing benefits for high-wage earners - _blankproposals embraced by Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Social Security actuary _blankevaluated the senators' plan and found it could cut benefits by 40 percent for high-wage earners by 2050.  However, the analysis also found that, with these changes, Social Security benefits could continue to be paid through 2084. Some might _blankargue that the proposals are rather drastic. Still, if nothing is done, there won't be enough money to pay full benefits under the current system by 2033.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, Eric Fehrnstrom, a Romney senior adviser, argues that the actuary's analysis of the senators' plan cannot be applied to the Romney proposal because although it is &quot;structurally similar . . . we have not specified the exact thresholds for the means-testing of Social Security.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the game that both campaigns like to play. The Obama campaign is trying to nail Romney with specifics, while avoiding them for itself, just as the Romney campaign is trying to dodge the specific implications of its proposals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Romney is proposing a cut in benefits for high-wage earners, candidate Obama in 2008 also targeted high-wage earners as a way to extend Social Security's solvency, _blankproposing a payroll tax increase on people making more than $250,000. Then and now, Obama opposes any increase in the retirement age, so that is a real point of contention between the two candidates.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The Pinocchio Test</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This frame of the &quot;Life of Julia&quot; series is fairly misleading. If Obama does something to improve the solvency of Social Security, benefits are likely to be cut in some fashion. If Obama - and future presidents - do nothing, benefits will also be cut. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign could have chosen to fight Romney with specifics - such as saying that Julia could retire as scheduled, without fear of an increase in her retirement age - but instead it chose to compare a version of Romney's proposals with a potentially unrealistic outcome.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing to the nation that he thinks that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry wasn't the first time Obama has linked his Protestant beliefs to his support for specific policies. In his address at the National Prayer Breakfast this year, he credited his faith for inspiring policies as diverse as funding for medical research and eliminating tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. &quot;Living by the principle that we are our brother's keeper [and] caring for the poor and those in need,&quot; Obama said, are values &quot;that have defined my own faith journey.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American politics is rife with religious rhetoric - but in the modern era,  it has almost always been deployed on behalf of conservative positions. Religious communities helped rally support for the North Carolina ballot proposition prohibiting same-sex marriage and civil unions, which passed Tuesday. No less an evangelical icon than Billy Graham appeared in print ads statewide to urge its passage, under the message: &quot;The Bible is clear - God's definition of marriage is between a man and a woman.&quot; Liberal politicians, on the other hand, have tended to ground their positions in secular arguments, and often warned that Republicans were endangering the separation of church and state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama cited several reasons for his support for gay marriage, including conversations with U.S. troops, his family and his staff. But his assertion that his views on same-sex marriage come from - not despite - his Christian faith marks a shift in U.S. politics. Democratic politicians now unabashedly cite religion when making their case, and GOP leaders sometimes find themselves in the unusual position of justifying - rather than merely stating - their religious claims. That's something that House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has cited his Catholic faith as a basis for the massive spending cuts in his proposed budget, has learned recently. Politicians from both parties now make explicitly religious arguments for opposing positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a time not long ago when the discussion of religion in politics centered on liberal causes - think of the civil rights movement or opposition to the war in Vietnam. When the religious right exploded onto the political scene in the late 1970s, however, many Democrats concluded that the introduction of religion into political discussion was a conservative act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they shied away from religious references, that assumption became self-fulfilling. By 2004, the meaning of words such as &quot;morality&quot; and &quot;Christianity&quot; had become so one-sided that exit polls for that year's presidential election used the phrase &quot;moral values&quot; as shorthand for a circumscribed category of conservative concerns such as opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage when asking what issues had most influenced voters' decisions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That exit poll question, as well as attacks on Democratic nominee John F. Kerry by Roman Catholic leaders for his support of abortion rights, inspired a collective epiphany among Democrats. They began to remind voters - and one another - that issues such as education, health care and protecting the environment reflected strongly held values as well. In 2006, Democrats won back control of Congress with the help of a new cast of candidates who spoke easily about their faith and beliefs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No group was more galvanized than Catholic Democrats, who were tired of Catholic leaders telling them they were bad Catholics or disinviting them from events at Catholic institutions. A group of young Catholic activists formed an organization called Catholics United, in part to hold politicians accountable on the issues they saw Catholic leaders largely ignoring. In 2007, they ran ads on Christian radio in the districts of members of Congress who opposed abortion and voted against the State Children's Health Insurance Program. &quot;He says he's pro-life, but for the second time in a month he's voted against health-care for kids,&quot; said the ad's female narrator. &quot;That's not pro-life.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) is another Catholic who has been frustrated by the fact that although Church leaders criticize her votes on abortion legislation, they remain silent about her Republican Catholic colleagues who deviate from church teaching on other issues. Last month, DeLauro made public a letter she sent to Cardinal Timothy Dolan, head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, calling on him to &quot;personally address the devastating impact of this [GOP] budget.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops are usually swift to speak out regarding budget documents. But this year they have been preoccupied by a campaign for religious freedom in response to the Obama administration's mandate that health insurance cover contraception. They had remained silent about the GOP budget. Embarrassed by DeLauro's missive, the USCCB released several letters stating opposition to the budget - one called proposed cuts &quot;unjustified and wrong&quot; - four days later. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly all of the Republican congressional leaders are Catholic, and they have been made particularly uncomfortable by the resurgence of an active Catholic opposition on the left. Last year, the head of Catholics United approached Ryan with a Bible and asked him to spend more time reading the Book of Matthew than Ayn Rand, who Ryan has said inspired him to enter public service. Video cameras captured Ryan awkwardly speed-walking away from the proffered Bible and into a waiting SUV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just in the past month, Ryan has attempted to explain how Catholic social teaching shaped his budget, only to have nearly 100 faculty members at Georgetown University sign a lettertaking issue with his interpretation before a scheduled speech at the Catholic campus. And both he and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) have stumbled in response to the bishops' criticism of the GOP budget. Ryan first tried to insist that the bishops' letters represented the views of just a few people (they were in fact elected to represent the other bishops). And Boehner dismissed the bishops' concerns, saying they needed to take &quot;a bigger look&quot; at the issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This new bipartisan politics of religion is a good thing - both for religion and for politics. For several decades, the right has held a monopoly over what it means to be religious in the United States, not to mention Christian or evangelical. The result has been devastating for the image of Christianity. When the Barna Group polled Americans ages 16 to 29 on what words best describe Christianity, the top response was &quot;anti-homosexual.&quot; The other common associations were &quot;judgmental,&quot; &quot;hypocritical&quot; and &quot;too involved in politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has not helped that for years, conservative politicians have explained their opposition to gay rights by simply stating, &quot;I'm a Christian,&quot; as if that automatically requires one to abhor the idea of same-sex marriage. Recent debates about the protection of religious freedom have assumed that the only religious motives that count are conservative ones. That's the concept at the core of arguments about the contraception mandate, as well as a number of religious freedom bills moving through state legislatures. Enthusiasm for those efforts might well flag if religious progressives were to demand protection for their beliefs as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our politics benefit from including more religious perspectives. When politicians are forced to   say how their faith informs their policies - instead of just citing it as part of their political identity - it becomes more difficult to use religion as a blanket explanation for a partisan stance. Instead of asserting that his budget is shaped by his Catholicism, Ryan has to delve into the tradition of Catholic social teaching. Boehner has to explain why he thinks the U.S. bishops are wrong to criticize the budget. And Obama will inevitably have to take on the charges from conservative Christians who are already calling his linkage of the Golden Rule and support for same-sex marriage &quot;an appalling blasphemy.&quot; Indeed, one of his own spiritual advisers - evangelical pastor Joel Hunter -says he is &quot;disappointed&quot; by Obama's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After years of pretending that the culture wars were a matter of religious views lined up against secular beliefs, politicians are recognizing what average Americans knew all along. A majority of Americans now believe that there is more than one way to get to heaven, pollsters report. Our political discussions finally reflect that there's also more than one answer to the question: &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motherhood, apple pie - and political attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Mother's Day approaching on Sunday, a ''super PAC'' backing Mitt Romney's presidential campaign has decided to revive the criticism that a Democratic strategist leveled against Mr. Romney's wife last month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The television ad begins with a warm, fuzzy look at Ann Romney, saying that she ''raised five boys. She successfully battled breast cancer and multiple sclerosis.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ad quickly turns negative, recalling that ''White House insider Hilary Rosen'' said Mrs. Romney ''never worked a day in her life.'' The ad also shows the comedian Bill Maher, an Obama supporter, saying that ''Ann Romney has never gotten her ass out of the house.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad concludes: ''Happy Mother's Day from Barack Obama's team.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's advisers have repeatedly noted that Ms. Rosen, a Democratic strategist who works with former Obama officials, has never been on the campaign or White House payroll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is part of a fierce battle that the presidential candidates are waging over women as they enter the final six months of the campaign. President Obama starts with a large lead among women, but Mr. Romney's campaign is hoping to make progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of that strategy for Mr. Romney includes a higher profile for his wife, who remains very popular on the campaign trail. In an op-ed in USA Today on Friday, Mrs. Romney remembers her own mother fondly and urges readers to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Women wear many hats in their lives. Daughter, sister, student, breadwinner,'' she wrote. ''But no matter where we are or what we're doing, one hat that moms never take off is the crown of motherhood. There is no crown more glorious.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign is not letting Mother's Day pass without notice, either. In an e-mail to supporters titled ''My Best Friend,'' Mr. Obama invites people to sign an electronic Mother's Day card for the first lady.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 18</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">559 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, can be clear as a bell when he denounces financial reform. But on an emergency conference call with analysts on Thursday to announce the bank's stunning $2 billion trading loss, his message was frustratingly vague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loss, according to Mr. Dimon, was in the bank's ''synthetic credit portfolio,'' which presumably means it involved the same type of complex derivatives that played such a destructive role in the financial crisis. And Mr. Dimon said that sloppiness, bad judgment and stupidity -- his own and his colleagues' -- had led to the loss. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a stunning admission from a man who led JPMorgan through the crisis relatively unscathed, but it doesn't explain what actually went wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Mr. Dimon did not say is that the loss also occurred because of a continued lack, nearly four years after the crisis, of rules and regulators up to the task of protecting taxpayers and the economy from the excesses of too big to fail banks; and, yes, of protecting the banks from their executives' and traders' destructive risk-taking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that JPMorgan's loss -- which Mr. Dimon has warned could ''easily get worse'' -- is not enough to topple the bank, is not the point. What matters is that JPMorgan, like the nation's other big banks, is still engaged in activities that can provoke catastrophic losses. If policy makers do not strengthen reform, then luck is the only thing preventing another meltdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank regulators should start by adopting a forceful Volcker Rule. Proposed by Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman and included in the Dodd-Frank reform law, the rule would curtail risky and speculative trading with the banks' own capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks hate the Volcker Rule, because less gambling means lower profits and lower bonuses for executives and traders. Mr. Dimon has been especially contemptuous, saying at one point that ''Paul Volcker by his own admission has said he doesn't understand capital markets. He has proven that to me.'' Early versions of the restrictions have been ambiguous and toothless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dodd-Frank also calls for new rules on derivatives -- including transparent trading and requirements for banks to back their trades with collateral and capital. If such rules were in place, JPMorgan's trades could not have escaped notice by regulators and market participants. In the face of heavy lobbying, the derivatives' rules have also been delayed or watered down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are now several bills in the House, with bipartisan support, to weaken the Dodd-Frank law on derivatives. One of those would let the banks avoid Dodd-Frank regulation by conducting derivatives deals through foreign subsidiaries. The JPMorgan loss was incurred in its London office, which doesn't lessen the effect here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney has called for repealing Dodd-Frank. That may win him Wall Street cash, but it is profoundly dangerous. President Obama and Congressional Democrats can take credit for Dodd-Frank, but they have not done enough to ensure that the rules are strong enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The force of Mr. Dimon's critique of Dodd-Frank has rested on his personal reputation for smarts and on JPMorgan's sheen of invincibility. His own admitted fallibility and the bank's shocking stumble are the best argument in favor of strong regulation. Now politicians and regulators need to stand up to the banks.</SPAN></P>

In addition, Gov.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney, who opposes gay marriage but says that same-sex couples should be afforded some rights, including the ability to adopt children, continued his careful strategy of staying largely mute on the subject. After President Obama announced Wednesday that he now supports gay marriage, the subject became a campaign issue on which the two candidates differ starkly.          Instead, Romney tried to shift the spotlight to his core economic message in his 15-minute speech Friday to hundreds of supporters inside a pipe and foundry business near downtown Charlotte.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney did not mention the $2 billion trading loss disclosed Thursday by JPMorgan Chase, the nation's largest bank, that may have broad implications for the financial sector. He also declined to comment after the speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A campaign spokesman, Rick Gorka, said the loss &quot;demonstrates the importance of oversight and transparency in the derivatives market.&quot; He added that Romney, as president, would &quot;push for common-sense regulation that gives regulators tools to do their jobs, and that gives investors more clarity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney has said in the past that he wants to repeal both the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law and the Sarbanes-Oxley accounting law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Massachusetts governor ended his speech by evoking patriotism. He told a story about his niece and her husband, who moved into a starter home with their 1-year-old daughter, who he said was &quot;stone deaf.&quot; When the husband, a lawyer, got called up by the National Guard to serve in Iraq, their household income declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She now had to live on a much lower income,&quot; Romney said of his niece. &quot;Now she's in this home, and the outside of her home is a whole dirt yard, no grass or anything in yet, just stones or dirt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighborhood association where they lived gave new homeowners one year until their landscaping was supposed to be put in. But, Romney said, his niece did not have the money to pay for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's concerned,&quot; Romney recalled. &quot;One morning she comes outside and there are her neighbors, all picking up the rocks out of her yard, raking the dirt. They put in a sprinkler system, they lay down sod, they put in landscaping, they even build a swing set for her daughter. This is the America that I love.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man at the center of U.S. President Barack Obama's advertising campaign against Mitt Romney is Jim Margolis, &quot;and his job is to make you think of call centers in India every time you hear Mr. Romney's name,&quot; Jeremy W. Peters writes in The New York Times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the Obama campaign kicked off a $25 million &quot;advertising blitz,&quot; Mr. Peters writes. &quot;In their ads, Web videos and online features, the president wants to thwart the influence of 'big oil'; Mr. Romney cashes their campaign checks. The president saved hundreds of thousands of jobs by rescuing the auto industry; Mr. Romney shipped jobs overseas. &quot;It's just what you expect from a guy who had a Swiss bank account,&quot; one ad says&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Margolis did not become a top chef in what Mr. Romney calls the president's &quot;hell's kitchen&quot; of negative ads based solely on his eye for a pretty picture and his flair for boiling down a good r&eacute;sum&eacute; in 30 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His past work shows why he is such an indispensable part of Mr. Obama's media team. In the 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Margolis produced a commercial that repeated John McCain's ill-advised assertion &quot;the fundamentals of our economy are strong&quot; over and over, helping to sear the phrase into voters' minds as the economy imploded that fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years later, he helped Senator Barbara Boxer of California win re-election against Carly Fiorina, the Republican nominee and former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, with ads that showed Ms. Fiorina being ushered into a chauffeured car as an aide held the door. One of them reminded voters, &quot;While Californians lost their jobs, Fiorina tripled her salary, bought a million-dollar yacht and five corporate jets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, blamed &quot;errors, sloppiness and bad judgment&quot; for the loss, which stemmed from a hedging strategy that backfired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trading in that hedge roiled markets a month ago, when rumors started circulating of a JPMorgan trader in London whose bets were so big that he was nicknamed &quot;the London Whale&quot; and &quot;Voldemort,&quot; after the Harry Potter villain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a bank that earned nearly $19 billion last year, the trading loss, which could go higher, will not cripple it in any way. Still, it demonstrates how a market blunder can shake even a financial giant that celebrates its &quot;fortress balance sheet.&quot;<BR>DealBook &raquo;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motherhood, apple pie - and political attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Mother's Day approaching on Sunday, a &quot;super PAC&quot; backing Mitt Romney's presidential campaign has decided to revive the criticism that a Democratic strategist leveled against Mr. Romney's wife last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A television ad that started running this week in nine states begins with a warm, fuzzy look at Ann Romney, saying that she &quot;raised five boys&quot; and continuing, &quot;She successfully battled breast cancer and multiple sclerosis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ad quickly turns negative, recalling that the &quot;White House insider Hilary Rosen&quot; said Mrs. Romney &quot;never worked a day in her life.&quot; The ad also shows the comedian Bill Maher, an Obama supporter, suggesting Mrs. Romney had not worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad concludes: &quot;Happy Mother's Day from Barack Obama's team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's advisers have repeatedly noted that Ms. Rosen, a Democratic strategist who works with former Obama officials, has never been on the campaign or White House payroll. The ad is part of a fierce battle for female voters that the presidential candidates are waging. Part of that strategy for Mr. Romney includes a higher profile for his wife, who remains very popular on the campaign trail. In an op-ed article in USA Today on Friday, Mrs. Romney remembered her own mother fondly and urged readers to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women wear many hats in their lives. Daughter, sister, student, breadwinner,&quot; she wrote. &quot;But no matter where we are or what we're doing, one hat that moms never take off is the crown of motherhood. There is no crown more glorious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign is not letting Mother's Day pass without notice, either. In ane-mail to supporters titled &quot;My Best Friend,&quot; Mr. Obama invites people to sign an electronic Mother's Day card for the first lady.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney's commencement address Saturday at Liberty University, the evangelical institution in Virginia founded by Jerry Falwell,  comes on the heels of President's Obama's announcement Wednesday that he supports same-sex marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a conference call with reporters Friday, Romney  campaign aides said the candidate was focused on giving an address for graduates and their parents, &quot;not a policy speech,&quot; and that Mr. Romney would not overtly wade into the issue of same-sex marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marriage isn't the focus of the speech, but he will mention the fact that marriage is an enduring institution, which deserves to be defended,&quot; one aide said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney struggled to win over evangelicals, some of whom were distrustful of his Mormon faith, during the primaries, but aides said he would not use the commencement speech to offer a particular pitch to evangelical and socially conservative voters, now that he is the presumptive Republican nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will also not delve deeply into his own faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't a speech about Mormonism,&quot; the aide said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the Romney campaign maintained that he did not want to get into policy issues in his speech, the aide said that Mr. Romney would talk about Mr. Obama's economic policies and how he believed they were hurting college graduates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restore Our Future, the super PAC supporting GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, tries to revive the mommy wars in an ad timed to Mother's Day on Sunday. The ad reprises the controversy over a remark about Romney's wife, Ann, made last month by Democratic political strategist Hilary Rosen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Male narrator: Ann Romney raised five boys. She successfully battled breast cancer and multiple sclerosis. But what does White House insider Hilary Rosen say about Ann Romney?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hilary Rosen (audio clip): Guess what? His wife has actually never worked a day in her life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Narrator: And Bill Maher, who gave a million dollars supporting Obama, attacks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Maher (video clip): Ann Romney has never gotten her ass out of the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcer: Happy Mother's Day from Barack Obama's team. Restore Our Future is responsible for the content of this message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visuals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photos of Ann Romney, Hilary Rosen, and a Mother's Day birthday card with photos of President Obama, Rosen and Maher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accuracy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts  are straightforward: Ann Romney did raise five sons and suffer breast cancer and multiple sclerosis. Bill Maher and Hilary Rosen did make those comments -- although Maher's full quote was that Romney &quot;has never gotten her ass out of the house to work.&quot; He then said, &quot;No one is denying that being a mother is a tough job,&quot; but he made a distinction between working at raising children and working for an employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosen, who made her comment on CNN, where she is a paid contributor, was villified by Republicans who said her comments reflected Democrats' disdain for women who stay home to raise children. She repeatedly went back on television to apologize to Ann Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim that is harder to prove is whether Rosen and Maher are an integral part of Obama's &quot;team'' and whether their comments are representative of the president's views. Rosen's remarks were renounced at the time by Obama, his wife, Michelle, and the leaders of his campaign. Rosen works for political consulting firm SKDKnickerbocker, which has worked for the Obama campaign in the past, and she has visited the White House -- although the White House would not clarify how many times. But she does not work for the Obama campaign or the Democratic Party. Maher, a comic and talk-show host, gave $1million  in February to Priorities USA Action, a pro-Obama super PAC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is  aimed at women, among whom Obama holds a lead vs. Romney in opinion surveys. The president's support is skewed to unmarried women, who support him 68% to 24%, according to the latest USA TODAY/Gallup Poll. Married women -- perhaps more likely to be stay-at-home moms -- favored Romney 47% to 43%. <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked consideration of a Democratic bill to prevent the doubling of some student loan interest rates, leaving the legislation in limbo less than two months before rates on subsidized federal loans are set to shoot upward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along party lines, the Senate voted 52 to 45 on a key procedural motion, failing to reach the 60 votes needed to begin debating the measure. Senator Olympia J. Snowe, the moderate Republican from Maine who is retiring, voted present. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senators said quiet negotiations had begun to resolve the impasse, but Democrats sought to raise the political pressure, vowing to take to the Senate floor to show the cost of inaction for students in their states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mitt Romney says he supports what we're trying to do. I'd suggest he pick up the phone and call Senator McConnell,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, referring to the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans blamed Democrats for the impasse and suggested that they were manufacturing a political controversy instead of working out differences in private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We all agree we're not going to let the rate go up,'' Mr. McConnell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote was the Senate Republicans' 21st successful filibuster of a Democratic bill this Congress, which started in January 2011. Republicans have blocked consideration of President Obama's full jobs proposal, as well as legislation repealing tax breaks for oil companies, helping local governments pay teachers and first responders, and setting a minimum tax rate for households earning more than $1 million a year. Republicans say the measures were flawed and potentially harmful to the economic recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the student loan filibuster may be the highest-profile stalemate yet, because unlike those earlier bills, this one is not likely to be abandoned. Mr. Obama has elevated the issue by hammering Republicans on it for weeks. American students took out twice the value of student loans in 2011, about $112 billion, as they did a decade before, after adjusting for inflation. Over all, Americans now owe about $1 trillion in student loans. In 2010, such debt surpassed credit card debt for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill in limbo addresses only part of that burden. Graduate students with Stafford loans pay a higher rate, as do students with unsubsidized Stafford loans. Most undergraduates take out both unsubsidized and subsidized loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans say they want to extend Democratic legislation passed in 2007 that temporarily reduced interest rates for low- and middle-income undergraduates who receive subsidized Stafford loans to 3.4 percent from 6.8 percent. But the Republicans would not accept the Senate Democrats' proposal to pay for a one-year extension by changing a law that allows some wealthy taxpayers to avoid paying Social Security and Medicare taxes by classifying their pay as dividends, not cash income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They want to raise taxes on people who are creating jobs when we are still recovering from the greatest recession since the Great Depression,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, who instead wanted to pay for the rate decrease by eliminating a fund for preventive health care in Mr. Obama's health care law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the vote, Senate Democrats arrayed college students to plead for a yes vote, including Clarise McCants, 21, a junior at Howard University in Washington who said she pulled herself out of a troubled neighborhood in North Philadelphia and relies on $13,500 in Stafford loans for her tuition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I know I'm not the only one with dreams,'' she said. ''I'm here to ask Congress, 'Don't double my rate.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have not always been so averse to closing the loophole that the Senate bill addresses. In 2004, when it emerged that John Edwards, then a vice-presidential hopeful, had classified himself as a ''subchapter S corporation'' to pay himself dividends rather than income, conservatives criticized him for avoiding payroll taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Democratic line of attack has been complicated by the House's actions. Shrugging off a veto threat, the House passed an extension of the subsidized rate last month, paid for with the preventive health care fund. Thirteen Democrats voted for the bill, making up for the 30 Republicans who voted no because they opposed federal subsidies for an interest rate that they believed should be set by market forces. Those Democratic defections put the House bill over the top and fortified Republican arguments that the Senate Democrats were now to blame for the stalemate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the House minority whip, said Tuesday that those Democratic votes were driven by politics, not substance. ''They didn't want that 30-second ad'' attacking them for opposing a rate-subsidy extension, he said. ''That was not a demonstration at all for the funding source.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans made clear they would go on offense, blaming Democrats if interest rates doubled July 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Instead of compounding the problem with more bad policies that raise taxes on small businesses and raid Social Security and Medicare, we must work together to prevent a rate increase on students and make it easier for job creators to hire them when they graduate,'' Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said after the vote.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Forget hope and change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of planning, President Obama's media team has prepared an aggressive strategy to portray Mitt Romney as insensitive to the plight of working people and beholden to powerful interests. They have researched possible lines of attack and drafted language that can be dropped into an advertisement at a moment's notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign advisers said they were willing to commit a considerable chunk of their advertising budget -- expected to be the largest any presidential campaign has ever seen -- to broadcasting these attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The work of the Obama message machine, a half-dozen outside advertising firms and in-house campaign strategists, is already on vivid display. In their ads, Web videos and online features, the president wants to thwart the influence of ''big oil''; Mr. Romney cashes their campaign checks. The president saved hundreds of thousands of jobs by rescuing the auto industry; Mr. Romney shipped jobs overseas. ''It's just what you expect from a guy who had a Swiss bank account,'' one ad says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the center of this effort is Jim Margolis, and his job is to make you think of call centers in India every time you hear Mr. Romney's name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a reporter in his studio on a recent afternoon, an unassuming Mr. Margolis seemed harmless enough as he leaned back in a swivel chair and suggested a few revisions to a video he was editing with his staff. Their work that day would become part of the $25 million advertising blitz the Obama campaign kicked off this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strip a few data points out of the script, he said; too many numbers might confuse people. Swap out a clip of a smiling family and replace it with a father and son playing baseball; it will look less staged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Margolis did not become a top chef in what Mr. Romney calls the president's ''hell's kitchen'' of negative ads based solely on his eye for a pretty picture and his flair for boiling down a good resume in 30 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His past work shows why he is such an indispensable part of Mr. Obama's media team. In the 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Margolis produced a commercial that repeated John McCain's ill-advised assertion ''the fundamentals of our economy are strong'' over and over, helping to sear the phrase into voters' minds as the economy imploded that fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years later, he helped Senator Barbara Boxer of California win re-election against Carly Fiorina, the Republican nominee and former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, with ads that showed Ms. Fiorina being ushered into a chauffeured car as an aide held the door. One of them reminded voters, ''While Californians lost their jobs, Fiorina tripled her salary, bought a million-dollar yacht and five corporate jets.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Margolis, 57, maintains a low profile in a presidential inner circle filled with advisers who write books and appear regularly on ''Meet the Press'' -- the antithesis of a flamboyant adman. His lack of visibility belies his influence in Democratic circles, where he first surfaced as a 23-year-old Congressional chief of staff in the 1980s. A contemplative man with silver hair, large blue eyes and a low, gravely voice, he has served as a close adviser to a host of top Democrats, including Senators Harry Reid, Max Baucus and Mark Warner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a debate coach, he once made Mrs. Boxer so angry during a prep session (he stood in very convincingly as Ms. Fiorina) that she had to take a walk outside to calm down. He still travels to Capitol Hill almost every Tuesday to offer strategic advice to Mr. Reid, who says of him, ''He's very good at making you feel you're better than you are.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you live in a state where a presidential contest has been close at some point in the last 20 years, you have probably seen one of Mr. Margolis's ads. During the 2004 Democratic primaries, Mr. Margolis's commercials featuring Senator John Kerry's crewmates from Vietnam recalling his heroism were credited with helping him win the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Margolis and his firm, GMMB, first produced ads for Mr. Obama in 2007, and their work quickly stood out for its subtle edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using video from one of Mr. Obama's speeches in Iowa, he created a gauzy 60-second commercial that made Hillary Rodham Clinton sound irrelevant with a line that never even mentioned her: ''The same old Washington textbook campaigns just won't do it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was a beautiful spot,'' said Mandy Grunwald, who was a senior strategist for Mrs. Clinton at the time. ''Everybody knew who he was talking about.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad's potency speaks to a fact about Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign that often goes overlooked. That year he ran more negative ads than any other candidate in history, according to the Wisconsin Advertising Project, a nonpartisan political research group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain was depicted in some commercials as out of touch and feeble. One recalled him saying that he could not remember how many houses he owned. ''Well, it's seven,'' the announcer said dismissively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign acknowledges that fiercely attacking Mr. Romney has risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Tonally we have to be very careful about the fact that the president does have standards and does have a brand that he feels strongly about,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior strategist. ''I think it's possible to be tough and also fair, tough and also factual. And that's what we're going to do. But rest assured, we will be responding when we are being attacked.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putting the efforts to define Mr. Romney aside, the Obama campaign faces problems with its own message. One big challenge that Mr. Margolis acknowledged is conveying optimism about the country's progress without seeming tone deaf to the struggles that many Americans still face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If your house is under water or you can't make your car payment, I'm not going to convince you that everything is O.K.,'' Mr. Margolis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after he pointed out some of the president's signature accomplishments, like the auto industry bailout, he added, ''While none of us should diminish the hardships, we also shouldn't be shy about telling the story of what this president is accomplishing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that Mr. Margolis has ever held back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2010 Boxer race, he sent a film crew to California to interview workers who were laid off by Ms. Fiorina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Fiorina never cared about our jobs. Not then. Not now,'' said one of the workers, his voice ringing with indignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Margolis also created a series of commercials that year for Mr. Reid using ordinary citizens to criticize Sharron Angle, his Tea Party-backed opponent, as reckless and erratic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one ad, a Republican who is a member of the National Rifle Association said of Ms. Angle's position on guns, ''It's crazy.'' What was most damning went left unsaid: the suggestion that he was speaking about Ms. Angle herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Margolis declined to discuss any ads in the works for the Obama campaign. But his advice to Mrs. Boxer in 2010 may offer a hint of what is to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He would always say, 'Barbara, this is a race between two choices,' '' Mrs. Boxer said in an interview. '' 'And you need to remind people that you're running against someone who shipped tens of thousands of jobs overseas and made her success by stepping over other people. You can never forget that.' ''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. talked about the effect &quot;Will and Grace&quot; had on the national debate on gay rights, he was harkening back to a time when gay, lesbian and transgender characters on network television became weapons in the culture wars. That's no longer true, argues Brian Stelter, pointing out that gay characters and themes on shows like &quot;Modern Family&quot; and &quot;Glee&quot; don't attract the outrage and boycott threats that were once aimed at &quot;Will and Grace&quot; and &quot;Ellen.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the contrary. Mitt Romney is known to be a fan of 'Modern Family,' and a Catholic group gave it a media award this month,&quot; he writes. Next up: a sitcom about a gay couple from NBC called &quot;The New Normal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The culture wars may get reheated during the presidential campaign and if so, the Obama ad guru Jim Margolis and his firm, GMMB will be ready, writes Jeremy W. Peters. A long-time Democratic strategist, Mr. Margolis specializes in hyper-aggressive negative advertising, Mr. Peters writes:  &quot;In their ads, Web videos and online features, the president wants to thwart the influence of 'big oil'; Mr. Romney cashes their campaign checks. The president saved hundreds of thousands of jobs by rescuing the auto industry; Mr. Romney shipped jobs overseas. 'It's just what you expect from a guy who had a Swiss bank account,' one ad says.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first test of &quot;termination rights&quot; - a revision of copyright law in which publishing and recording rights to songs revert to the original artists after 35 years - had its first big test in court and the result was a win for the songwriter. Two music publishers sought to stop Victor Willis, the leader of the disco group The Village People, from reclaiming his rights to hits like &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot; but a California judge shot down the suit, writes Larry Rohter. The judge, &quot;was emphatic that circumstances exist in which musical creators, meaning both songwriters and recording artists, are entitled to 'recapture' their interest in a musical work after 35 years even if their original contract precluded them from doing so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In earnings: AOL beat Wall Street expectations with revenue of $529.4 million and earnings of $21.1 million. But the earnings still contain some worrisome numbers as Peter Kafka at All Thing D points out: display advertising is down 1 percent and traffic to AOL properties is down 4 percent. True, AOL's old dial-up business continues to fall but, as Mr. Kafka points out, the company did spend a lot of money to buy The Huffington Post and other sites like TechCrunch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Walt Disney Company announced a 21 percent increase in quarterly profit, up to $1.14 billion, on the strength of cable fees for ESPN and increased business for the company's resorts and cruises. But it will have to put off those plans to build a new resort on Mars: the film division swung to a loss after a $200 million write-down on the exorbitant sci-fi epic, &quot;John Carter.&quot; The company's online properties also continue to struggle and are undergoing yet another overhaul, writes Brooks Barnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discovery Communications announced disappointing quarterly earnings largely tied to its stake in the Oprah Winfrey Network. A network run by Ms. Winfrey seemed like the surest bet in television when Discovery teamed up with the talk-show star in 2008. But since it began in January 2011, the channel has struggled to attract the viewers and attention that her network show could take for granted. Discovery's earnings were $221 million, down from $305 million in the same quarter one year earlier.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORT LUPTON, Colo. - At an event at an oil-and-gas production company here Wednesday morning, Mitt Romney refused to answer questions on same-sex marriage, a topic about which President Obama is expected to speak this afternoon, in aninterview with Robin Roberts of ABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not on the rope line,&quot; Mr. Romney said, when pressed by reporters after an energy event to comment on the president and gay marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney also ignored questions about Tuesday's vote in North Carolina, in which voters in large numbers supported an amendmentto the state's constitution to ban same-sex marriages, partnerships and civil unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Rick Gorka, the traveling press secretary for the Romney campaign, was asked to clarify the former Massachusetts governor's&nbsp; position, as well as comment on the news out of North Carolina, he said that he was unable to, but that he we would ask about holding a press conference for Mr. Romney to answer questions on the news of the day. However, Mr. Romney and Mr. Gorka then departed, without taking questions from the national media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney did, however, address the topic of same-sex marriage in morning interviews with local affiliates here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by Fox News's KDVR-TV about a bill that would have allowed civil unions for same-sex couples in Colorado, which died late Tuesday night, Mr. Romney reiterated his belief that marriage should be between a man and a woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, when these issues were raised in my state of Massachusetts,&quot; he said, &quot;I indicated my view, which is I do not favor marriage between people of the same gender, and I do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name. My view is the domestic partnership benefits, hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate, but that the others are not.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, who rarely holds news conferences, carved out time after a campaign speech in Oklahoma on Wednesday afternoon to take questions from the news media, putting on the record his take on the big news of the day.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a very tender and sensitive topic,'' Mr. Romney said, &quot;as are many social issues. But I have the same view I've had since, well, since running for office.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Keith Judd, who is serving a sentence of more than 17 years in Texas, won more than 40 percent of vote in the Democratic primary. President Obama won 57.27 percent. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, West Virginia's Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin and its Senator Joe Manchin, both Democrats, would not say whether they would vote for President Obama, laying bare the fact that the president faces an uphill climb even among members of his own party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the president's campaign took a more bizarre blow during Tuesday night's primaries in West Virginia, when a prisoner in Texas won more than 40 percent of vote in the Democratic race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Judd is serving a sentence of more than 17 years at  Beaumont Federal Correctional Institution in Texas for extortion charges related to threats he made at the University of New Mexico in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to unofficial primary results on the state's election Web site, Mr. Judd earned 42.73 percent of the vote - 57,081 votes. Mr. Obama won 57.27 percent of the vote, with a final tally of 76,510 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West Virginia has more registered Democrats than Republicans -  52.25 percent to 28.72 percent, at last count - but this state voted for Senator John McCain of Arizona in 2008 and has never warmed to Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration's clean-energy policies have not played well in the state's huge coal and energy industry, and the state has frequently locked horns with the Environmental Protection Agency over its mine permitting process and, more recently, new reductions in carbon emissions standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I voted against Obama,&quot; said Ronnie Brown, 43, an electrician who says he is a conservative Democrat, to The Associated Press. &quot;I don't like him. He didn't carry the state before, and I'm not going to let him carry it again.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Mr. Judd's impressive performance, he will not get any delegates at the Democratic National Convention this summer because, according to The Charleston Gazette, nobody has volunteered to be one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney, who, with 58,651 votes in West Virginia's primary, barely edged out Mr. Judd, commented on the election earlier on Wednesday, according to ABC News. &quot;I think they got more problems on that side of the aisle than we do on ours.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am left feeling impressed and invigorated upon reading that former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal  hauled in a doctorate from Barry University in Miami (&quot;Shaq: Why I'm getting a doctoral degree,&quot; The Forum, Friday). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I was put off  when some  NFL draft commentators described  the return of Andrew Luck, Indianapolis' new quarterback, to Stanford to complete his degree as a hindrance to his development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education is the key to a stable, happy life. As a sports fan, I am not blind to brevity  of time that today's athletes have to ensure their financial futures. But that only reinforces the value of a  worldview and marketable skills that a degree imparts, a value  that trumps  athletic prowess, for the student  and our society. My congratulations to O'Neal, Luck and all of May's graduates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dems go for truth in ads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I agree with your Thursday editorial &quot;The campaign goes negative&quot; that we can expect a lot of negative ads in the months ahead, especially from the &quot;Super PACs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I have to disagree with you on the examples you cited from the two campaigns. President Obama's&nbsp;ad accused Mitt Romney of encouraging companies to ship jobs overseas, commenting, &quot;It's just what you would expect from a guy who had a Swiss bank account.&quot; Not exactly untrue, since Romney, as head of Bain Capital, did ship jobs overseas and he did have a Swiss bank account. Obama also questioned whether Romney would have gone after Osama bin Laden, a fair comment given Romney's earlier  remarks on spending time and money to go after bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, Romney's&nbsp;ad quoting Obama as saying, &quot;If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose,&quot;  was taken out of context and is a lie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter what the Democrats come up with, there is often a basis for what they say. Not so with many Republicans, who have learned the political truth that if you repeat a lie often enough, the public will believe it. It is up to responsible publications like USA TODAY to recognize the difference.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am one of those people who believe that the movie about Mark Zuckerberg should have been called The Unsocial Network  because &quot;social&quot; means face-to-face. However, plaudits should be offered when they have been earned. It is with that in mind that I applaud Facebook for creating an &quot;organ donor&quot; network (&quot;Facebook feature pushes organ donation,&quot; News, May 2).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more successful this effort is, the more lives  will be saved,  thus allowing organ recipients to talk to a &quot;friend&quot; (the real kind) sitting across from them at a table.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             ALBANY, N.Y. - President Obama called on Congress on Tuesday to support a five-point &quot;to-do list,&quot; featuring job creation and mortgage relief measures, in his latest effort to paint the legislative body as an obstructionist force during an election year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has proposed all of the measures before. But as Washington has grown more polarized during the presidential campaign season, he has been trying to use Congress as a foil to highlight his administration's efforts to pass legislation to stimulate the economy.          &quot;In this make-or-break moment for the middle class, there is no excuse for inaction, no excuse for dragging our feet. None,&quot; Obama told the crowd at a nanotechnology facility at the State University of New York at Albany.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Obama's remarks, two flat-screen television monitors showed a graphic in the form of a green Post-it Note titled &quot;Congress To-Do List&quot; and laying out the five items with un-checked squares next to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president told the crowd that everyone could see the list on the White House Web site. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about the size of a Post-it Note, so every member of Congress should have time to read it,&quot; he quipped, drawing laughs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the start of the year, Obama has pushed Congress to support his economic agenda, casting Republicans as opposing him for political gain. The president hopes to link presumed GOP nominee Mitt Romney to congressional Republicans at a time when Congress's approval rating is 17 percent, according to a recent Gallup poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans pushed back against the White House, noting that they have supported several of Obama's initiatives, including the payroll tax cut, long-term unemployment insurance and several free-trade agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said Tuesday that he welcomes Obama's focus on job creation but that the GOP remains opposed to a White House plan to give income tax cuts of 10 percent to firms that create new jobs or dole out raises this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that we ought to let the investors decide on how best to allocate their capital so that we can see small business grow again,&quot; Cantor said. &quot;But these are differences that we can overcome and differences we can resolve if the president will just join us in saying we've got to solve these problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his remarks, Obama pressed Republicans to support his proposals for a 20 percent tax cut for businesses that bring manufacturing jobs back from overseas and a 10 percent tax credit for companies that hire workers and increase wages. He used the backdrop of the high-tech facility to underline his push for investment in new technologies that will help the nation remain competitive in a quickly changing global market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another initiative on his to-do list would allow homeowners to refinance at lower interest rates, a proposal he will highlight during a stop this week in Reno, Nev., where foreclosure rates are the highest in the country. The president also is calling for a veterans jobs corps to help service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan get jobs as police officers and firefighters.obs as police officers and firefighters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama challenged Republicans who contend that his government is &quot;bloated,&quot; saying that his administration has created private-sector jobs even as public hiring remains sluggish. He contrasted that to his Republican predecessors, who he said increased government hiring as part of their economic recoveries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I made this point so you don't buy into this whole bloated-government argument,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrapping up his speech, Obama&nbsp;ad-libbed two more items, demanding that Congress not allow federally subsidized student loan interest rates to double this summer and to approve a transportation bill that would provide funding for construction projects. The Senate defeated a measure Tuesday that would have kept the low rates for another year. House Minority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said the president should instead press Senate Democrats to pass a budget: &quot;How can you continue to run a business or a country with no budget? Three years in a row, a trillion-dollar deficit year over year and no budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trip marked a rare recent venture for the president into a state that is not an electoral battleground, but New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, one of the nation's most popular Democratic governors, joined him at the event. And Obama is eager to appeal to working-class voters in the Northeast and the Rust Belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his introductory remarks, Cuomo lauded the president and New York's economic turnaround and even employed Obama's campaign slogan, &quot;Forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. President, I can promise you this: Because of your leadership, this state is not going backward, this state is going forward,&quot; Cuomo said to applause. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House initially was going to send Obama to Asheville, N.C., but scuttled that plan two weeks ago and announced that he would instead speak in Albany. The Raleigh News &amp; Observer noted Tuesday that North Carolina was holding a vote on a controversial amendment to the state constitution that would ban same-sex marriage. Obama has not supported such unions, saying his views are &quot;evolving,&quot; a position that has drawn heat from liberal supporters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months on the sidelines, major liberal donors including the financier George Soros are preparing to inject up to $100 million into independent groups to aid Democrats' chances this fall. But instead of going head to head with the conservative ''super PACs'' and outside groups that have flooded the presidential and Congressional campaigns with negative advertising, the donors are focusing on grass-roots organizing, voter registration and Democratic turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The departure from the conservatives' approach, which helped Republicans wrest control of the House in 2010, partly reflects liberal donors' objections to the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which paved the way for super PACs and unbridled campaign spending. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in interviews, donors and strategists involved in the effort said they also did not believe they could match advertising spending by leading conservative groups like American Crossroads and Americans for Prosperity, and instead wanted to exploit what they see as the Democrats' advantage in grass-roots organizing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Super PACs are critically important,'' said Rob Stein, the founder of the Democracy Alliance, a group of liberal donors who will convene near Miami this week to discuss where to steer their money this year. But the liberal groups, he said, believe that local efforts and outreach through social media ''can have an enormous impact in battleground states in 2012.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a move likely to draw in other major donors, Mr. Soros will contribute $1 million each to America Votes, a group that coordinates political activity for left-leaning environmental, abortion rights and civil rights groups, and American Bridge 21st Century, a super PAC that focuses on election-oriented research. The donations will be Mr. Soros's first major contributions of the 2012 election cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''George Soros believes the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United opened the floodgates to special interests' paying for political ads,'' said Michael Vachon, a spokesman for Mr. Soros. ''There is no way those concerned with the public interest can compete with them. Soros has always focused his political giving on grass-roots organizing and holding conservatives accountable for the flawed policies they promote. His support of these groups is consistent with those views.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, in an indication that he does not expect significant advertising spending from Democratic-leaning outside groups at this stage, President Obama unveiled a $25 million ad campaign against Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A super PAC founded by two former Obama aides, Priorities USA Action, has struggled to raise money against better-financed conservative groups like American Crossroads, which expects to spend $300 million on the presidential, House and Senate elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those difficulties stem in part from Mr. Obama's past opposition to spending by outside groups, which has dampened donor enthusiasm despite his about-face this year. But it also reflects how major liberal donors and independent groups have focused since 2004 on creating a permanent infrastructure of liberal research and voter-outreach groups. That year, liberal groups spent more than $200 million on advertising and grass-roots activity in a failed bid to deprive President George W. Bush of a second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative independent groups, including super PACs that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on election ads, dominated the advertising wars in 2010, helping Republicans make major gains in Congress, and their money has had a similar impact so far in this cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The idea that we're going to engage in an arms race on advertising with the Republicans is not appealing to many liberal donors,'' said David Brock, the founder of American Bridge 21st Century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertising-oriented Democratic super PACs, including Priorities USA and two groups founded to back Democrats in Congress, remain on the list of organizations that the Democracy Alliance recommends to its members. Robert McKay, who is the chairman of the Democracy Alliance and sits on the board of Priorities USA, said the $100 million expected to be spent this year by alliance members would include some money for election ads, but would most likely favor grass-roots organizing and research groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is a bias towards funding infrastructure as it relates to the elections,'' Mr. McKay said. ''That means get-out-the-vote efforts'' directed toward young voters, single women, black voters and Latinos, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations likely to be a part of the effort include Catalist, which creates voter lists for allied liberal groups; ProgressNow, a network of state-based Web sites for liberal opinion and activism; and the Latino Engagement Fund, a new group that works to register and turn out Latino voters for Democrats. Conservative independent groups are financing similar outreach to Latino voters: the American Action Network, which spent $26 million against Democratic candidates in 2010, last year unveiled the Hispanic Leadership Network, which will seek to mobilize center-right Latino voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberals outside the Democracy Alliance are also likely to make significant contributions, as are labor unions, which plan to spend up to $400 million on state, local and federal races, and advocacy groups like the Sierra Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some groups will pay for both advertising and organizing. PAC+, a super PAC founded by the San Francisco philanthropist Steve Phillips, a member of the Democracy Alliance, expects to spend about $10 million on Latino voters in six states, with a heavy emphasis on Arizona, which the Obama campaign is seeking to turn into a battleground. Half of PAC+ spending will go to enrollment and half to advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You can dump 10 or 20 million in TV ads in Ohio and try to reach the persuadable swing voters there, or you can up voter turnout among Latinos in Colorado and Arizona and win that way,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''It's much cheaper.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11:44 a.m. Updated The Obama campaign will begin an extensive advertising campaign this week in nine battleground states, part of a broader effort by the president to frame his first term around a narrative of momentum and unfinished progress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's argument to voters, summed up in the new 60-second commercial: let me finish the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's strategist, said Monday that the ad buy would be $25 million this month alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial begins with a retelling of the events that led to the Great Recession, events that an announcer reminds viewers actually began before Mr. Obama took office: worst financial collapse since the Great Depression; 4.4 million jobs lost; stock market plummets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Some said our best days were behind us. He believed in us. He fought for us,'' the announcer says before reciting a list of the president's accomplishments, like the auto industry rescue and the killing of Osama bin Laden. ''But we're coming back.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's political strategists believe that it is important to counter the criticism coming from Mitt Romney and Republicans that Mr. Obama had his chance to turn the country around but failed to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When you tell the story from the other side, it's that one day the president showed up to a blank slate and now things aren't good,'' said Larry Grisolano, director of paid media for the Obama campaign. ''Having that narrative, knowing the complete story is essential to making the right judgment.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In an e-mail to his supporters on Monday night, Mr. Santorum said he would throw his support behind Mr. Romney for the Republican nomination. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Santorum toldhis supporters in an e-mail Monday night that he was endorsing  Mitt Romney as the Republican presidential candidate and that &quot;all hands on deck&quot; would be needed to defeat President Obama in the fall. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania who dropped his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month after making a strong showing in multiple states, said he met privately with Mr. Romney in Pittsburgh last Friday.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During that hour-long meeting, Mr. Santorum said that he felt a responsibility to assess Mr. Romney's commitment to issues that are important to social conservatives and tea party supporters, among others. He said he also wanted a commitment from Mr. Romney, assuring him that there would be &quot;appropriate representation&quot; of conservatives in a Romney administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they also discussed the role of the family in the country's economic success. &quot;I was impressed with the Governor's deep understanding of this connection and his commitment to economic policies that preserve and strengthen families,&quot; Mr. Santorum said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Santorum noted that he had repeatedly raised concerns during the Republican primary fight over whether  Mr. Romney would take on Mr. Obama's health care policy. However, in the e-mail, he told his supporters that he had no doubt that Mr. Romney would work with a Republican Congress to repeal it and replace it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Above all else, we both agree that President Obama must be defeated,&quot; Mr. Santorum said. &quot;The task will not be easy. It will require all hands on deck if our nominee is to be victorious. Governor Romney will be that nominee and he has my endorsement and support to win this the most critical election of our lifetime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He closed by saying that while his conversation with Mr. Romney was productive, he intended to keep the lines of &quot;communication open with him and his campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Mr. Santorum's praise for Mr. Romney in his endorsement, the Democratic National Committee was trying to make sure that people did not forget all the unkind things he said about his fellow Republican during the campaign that were captured onvideo.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Top political advisers in each campaign on Monday expressed frustration with the rhetoric coming from the other side. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contest between Mitt Romney and President Obama has barely begun, and yet both campaigns are already prodding and testing to see how far they can push the line of acceptable attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Euclid, Ohio, on Monday, Mr. Romney was initially silentwhen a female supporter said that Mr. Obama should be tried for treason - a silence that Democrats said spoke volumes about where the Republican thinks the line is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours earlier, in a conference call with reporters, Mr. Obama's top political adviser, David Axelrod, called the people who run &quot;super PACs&quot; backing Mr. Romney - including Karl Rove, the political strategist for President George W. Bush - &quot;contract killers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken together, the incidents suggest the intensity of feelings on both sides has been ratcheted up long before the campaign's usual crunch time in the final few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it raises the question of whether the campaigns can wage a fierce political battle without resorting to the kind of destructive personal attacks that have become more and more common at the highest level of American politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In interviews on Monday with Mr. Axelrod and with Stuart Stevens, the top political strategist for Mr. Romney, both men expressed frustration about the rhetoric of the opposing campaign. And both said they intended to stay away from character attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This other stuff, when you get gratuitous in attacking someone's character, someone's fundamental humanity, that's over the line,&quot; Mr. Axelrod said, adding that Mr. Romney should have chastised the woman in Ohio right away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no handbook on this,&quot; Mr. Axelrod said. &quot;There isn't a memo from the campaign on it. The thing you have to consult is your own conscience and your own judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Stevens said that Mr. Romney said later that he did not think the president should be tried for treason. Mr. Stevens said Mr. Romney probably did not hear or understand what the woman had said when he first heard it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he criticized Mr. Axelrod for the &quot;contract killers&quot; remark and accused Mr. Obama's campaign of using personal attacks about Mr. Romney's character to try to win the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've decided to run, at least for the moment, a campaign that is very personal,&quot; Mr. Stevens said, pointing to a recent ad that mentions that Mr. Romney has a Swiss bank account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's part of their strategy,&quot; Mr. Stevens said. &quot;I don't think they respect Mitt Romney's private-sector achievements or others who have succeeded outside of government. I think that is a tone they have.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama have gone out of their way at certain moments to describe their opponent in positive terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his kickoff rally on Saturday, Mr. Obama delivered a speech that was hard-hitting and critical. But he also called Mr. Romney &quot;a patriotic American who has raised a wonderful family, and he has much to be proud of.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, when Mr. Romney announced his candidacy in a speech in New Hampshire last year, he said Americans had been hopeful that Mr. Obama would succeed when he took the oath of office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the time, we didn't know what sort of a president he would make,&quot; Mr. Romney said. &quot;It was a moment of crisis for our economy, and when Barack Obama came to office, we wished him well and hoped for the best.&quot; Later in the speech, he declared the Obama presidency a failure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, Mr. Romney has taken to calling Mr. Obama &quot;a nice guy,&quot; while quickly adding that &quot;he's in over his head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But such moments have been fleeting during the months of shadowboxing that Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have been engaged in while Republicans concluded their nominating process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the two men and their campaigns have fully engaged, the rhetoric has quickly become even more personal. And as they seek to energize their supporters, both sides run the risk of alienating independent voters often say they are turned off by vitriol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr. Axelrod and Mr. Stevens said they are aware of that danger. Mr. Stevens noted that during a debate in Orlando, Fla., Mr. Romney was the only Republican candidate on the stage who refused to call Mr. Obama a &quot;socialist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a Republican primary, when it would have been to his advantage to do it, he didn't,&quot; Mr. Stevens recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet, both Mr. Axelrod and Mr. Stevens vowed not to relent when it comes to challenging the veracity and character of the other candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Axelrod said he sees a pattern in Mr. Romney's behavior, pointing to his decision not to initially criticize Rush Limbaugh's comments this year describing a law student who spoke in favor of the administration's insurance rules on contraception coverage a &quot;slut.&quot; And he said Mr. Obama's campaign would not mince words when they think Mr. Romney is lying about something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard to be delicate when someone doesn't tell the truth,&quot; Mr. Axelrod said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Mr. Stevens accused Mr. Obama and his team of a pattern of being ruthless when it comes to dealing with an opponent. He pointed to the tough rhetoric that Mr. Obama and Mr. Axelrod used during his 2008 primary campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ask Hillary Clinton's campaign about that pattern,&quot; Mr. Stevens said, adding that &quot;I would hope that there won't be a double standard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, Senator John McCain of Arizona was praised after he chided a woman for calling Mr. Obama &quot;an Arab.&quot; Not only did he take her microphone away, but he defended Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, ma'am,&quot; Mr. McCain famously said. &quot;He's a decent family man, citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues and that's what this campaign's all about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that sentiment from Mr. McCain was repeatedly tested in the waning days of the 2008 campaign, as his supporters often booed him for saying nice things about his opponent. A handful of supporters sometimes yelled &quot;terrorist&quot; in reference to Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, four years later, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney are about to begin a new contest in an arguably more polarized and divisive atmosphere. So far, both campaigns seem to be struggling to find the right tone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential primaries can be counted on to bring flash floods of political advertising to one state after another: brief, intense and noisy. As the amount of money spent on political persuasion has risen, there are now some places where political ads are more like a steady rain. Here in Columbus, it is pouring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six months before the election, the evening news, morning news, and even Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune are peppered with political ads from candidates, super PACs, and issue advocacy groups from the left and right. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Petroleum Institute would like Ohioans to &quot;vote 4 more domestic energy.&quot; President  Obama would like to remind voters that Republican candidate Mitt Romney has a Swiss bank account. The League of Conservation Voters would like voters to thank Sen. Sherrod Brown for fighting for Ohio jobs. The super PAC Restore Our Future would like everyone to know about the time Romney helped an employee find his missing daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Columbus draws a lot of political advertising because it's the largest city in a big swing state that this year also has a heated Senate contest and congressional races reconfigured by redistricting.  What's different here is that when the campaigns end, the advertising keeps on going. Political ads are on the air in Columbus all the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's great news for the local TV stations battered by a recession that torpedoed their commercial advertisers. &quot;We're on the other end saying, 'Thank you.' We're running around with a bushel basket trying to catch it when it falls,&quot; said Tom Griesdorn, general manager of WBNS-TV, the Columbus CBS affiliate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010,  viewers in the 22 counties that make up the Columbus television market were treated to 43,134 political ads, including candidates, ballot issues and policy issue ads, according to Kantar Media data provided by TVB, the broadcast stations' trade association. In 2011, without congressional or gubernatorial races, viewers still saw 16,111 ads -- an average of 44 spots a day.  Obama ran the first ads of his 2012 re-election campaign in Columbus four months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political ads will be the top category of ad revenue for the station in 2012, Griesdorn said, even though car companies have begun to revive their ad spending. Since March 2011, the station has run 2,588 political spots at a cost of $2.16 million, according to the publicly available files of political advertising that TV stations are required to maintain. And it's just one of five commercial broadcast station in Columbus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see issue advertising here outside of the election cycle&quot; as well as in it, said Dan Bradley, general manager of WCMH-TV, Columbus' NBC affiliate. &quot;There's always something that's being marketed here that's political in nature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Borrell Associates, an advertising research firm, political campaigns and outside groups are likely to spend $9.8 billion on the 2012 elections, and more than half of that  will go to TV ads. In Ohio, which has at least eight media markets, political advertising will reach $391 million, the firm projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From 2010 til now, we've really seen the beginning of the endless campaign. Certainly the issue ads never stop, and the ... presidential runs are getting earlier and earlier and earlier,&quot; said Kip Cassino, a political media researcher at Borrell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Petroleum Institute has been on the air in Columbus for more than a year. Some of the spots  urge voters to &quot;Vote 4 Energy.&quot; Others are aimed at generating popular support for &quot;fracking,&quot; the extraction of natural gas from shale. The group runs ads &quot;pretty much all of the time to encourage Americans to become more informed on energy issues,&quot; spokeswoman Linda Rozett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad campaigns are also intense elsewhere. Right now, Las Vegas; Grand Junction, Colo.; Charlottesville, Va.; and Tampa are on the list of top markets for both the Obama campaign and Crossroads GPS, the  Republican super PAC that runs ads critical of the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between the two groups, viewers in those cities saw 1,583 ads over  11 days in April, according to figures released Wednesday by the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's nice to be a swing state,&quot; said Mark LeGrand, general manager of WTMJ in Milwaukee. His worry: running out of air time. National political advertisers will wait to run ads until after the state's June 5 gubernatorial recall election and then will not want to air ads during the two weeks of the Olympics, which begin July 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means  &quot;all the money is going to drop in a much smaller window,&quot; LeGrand said. &quot;At some point, you can run out of inventory. There are only 24 hours in a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ad sales reps have  to accommodate both political advertisers and the car dealers and supermarkets that also want to advertise, said Barber, the Columbus NBC station manager. &quot;It's a double-edged sword. It's great to get all this revenue, but we have to maintain our relationships with advertisers who are going to be here the day after the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a recent League of Women Voters gathering here, members decried the quantity and tone of political ads. &quot;Everyone at this table is looking for an educated electorate,&quot; said Ron Miller, 63, a retired vocational rehabilitation teacher. &quot;Political advertising is not the way to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've become so used to it, I hardly even pay attention,&quot; said Danielle Smith, 25, a social worker and board member of the league's Columbus chapter. &quot;It's almost become the norm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cassino said that this year's huge spending will test whether there can be too many ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you just stop paying attention to it? That's really going to be the question that gets answered when people are picking over the bones of this one,&quot; Cassino said. &quot;Did it work? Did spending all that money really do the job?&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crude oil prices slid Monday to the lowest level since February as weak economic data and high prices dampened expectations for consumption just three weeks ahead of the summer driving season. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil analysts also said that the outcome of European elections - with candidates critical of government austerity measures winning in France and Greece - had also revived concerns about the stability of the euro zone. A stronger dollar also pushed oil prices down slightly.          The price of the benchmark West Texas Intermediate grade of crude oil fell 55 cents to $97.94 a barrel for June delivery, a drop of 11 percent since the 2012 peak of $109.77 reached Feb. 24.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">             U.S. gasoline prices have also eased slightly, edging down to $3.78 a gallon, down about 4 cents from a week ago and down 15.5 cents in the past month, according to AAA, though nine states still have prices of $4 a gallon or more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While still steep, lower gasoline prices could defuse a potentially thorny campaign issue for President Obama. GOP presidential front-runner Mitt Romney has said that there is &quot;no question&quot; that Obama is to blame for high gasoline prices. Obama has blamed global supply and demand.           Fadel Gheit, oil analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said the reasons for lower oil prices recently were &quot;weak demand caused by slow economy; less fear of potential supply disruption; Obama's threat to go after financial speculators; Saudi Arabia's increased production to reduce prices and help economic recovery; [and] increased U.S. [oil] production.&quot;          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil analysts warned that crude prices could still firm up if the economic recovery picks up or if there are renewed fears of a supply disruption in the Persian Gulf. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've seen some disappointing economic numbers, and there are concerns over the European elections and the overall euro sovereign-debt issue,&quot; said David Greely, head of energy research at Goldman Sachs. &quot;But U.S. oil demand is holding up well given the high oil prices and the moderate pace of U.S. economic growth. We expect that U.S. economic growth of around 2 percent will continue to support U.S. oil demand.&quot;          Recent financial deals to keep open some aging East Coast refineries have also eased concerns about gasoline prices in that region, and U.S. inventories are plentiful.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Edward Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup, said gasoline prices could increase as the peak driving season approaches. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This summer looks like it may be slightly weaker than we thought it was going to be,&quot; Morse said. &quot;But it's still a tight market, and summer gasoline is hard for refiners to make.  We don't think the worst is over for consumers, and I'd be surprised if there is not another price pickup before the July Fourth weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reversal of the Seaway oil pipeline, which runs from Oklahoma to refineries along the Gulf Coast, would ease the bottleneck at Cushing, Okla., and raise prices there. The Cushing oil terminal is where the New York Mercantile Exchange prices its benchmark crude. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The global oil supply picture has been less dire than many oil traders expected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Higher Saudi oil production has offset declines in Iran's oil exports. These have been impeded by Europe's decision to impose an embargo on imports from Iran and by the tightening of U.S. financial sanctions worldwide against companies buying oil from Iran.          In addition, Morse noted, Iraqi oil production and exports hit recent highs in April.           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supplies have been disrupted by local fighting in the Sudans, Syria, Yemen and Nigeria. And Iran remains a major wild card.  For now, however, geopolitical anxieties have eased. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greely said there is little premium in the oil price due to fears of a conflict over Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems like the concerns over Iran have receded into the background a little bit,&quot; he said. &quot;The market has been much more focused on the economy. In both Washington and Iran, the rhetoric has died down a little bit.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global demand remains uncertain, given the debate over austerity in Europe and signs that China's breakneck growth may be slowing somewhat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, now that Japan has closed all of its 54 nuclear power plants in the wake of last year's tsunami, the Asian economic giant is importing 300,000 to 400,000 barrels of fuel oil a day. Several other countries have been building up inventories, which were drawn down in Europe during the conflict in Libya last year. mufsons@washpost.com</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Santorum, who bowed out of the Republican presidential nominating contest after capturing 11 states and some 3 million votes, endorsed his erstwhile rival Mitt Romney on Monday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to his supporters, the former Pennsylvania senator said that he was impressed with Romney's &quot;commitment to economic policies that preserve and strengthen families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He clearly understands that having pro-family initiatives are not only the morally and economically right thing to do, but that the family is the basic building block of our society and must be preserved,&quot; Santorum wrote in the letter e-mailed to supporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The endorsement comes as Romney looks to shore up his support among conservatives, who powered Santorum to victory in several states, particularly in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Romney and Santorum met for an hour in Pittsburgh, where the former Pennsylvania senator urged Romney to hire conservatives to work on his campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the primary, Santorum was one of Romney's harshest critics, suggesting that he was unelectable because of his more centrist views and the health-care reform he enacted while governor of Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Santorum, who resurrected his career with his surprisingly strong  challenge of Romney, said that he was satisfied that the presumptive Republican candidate would overturn the Obama administration's health-care reform law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My conversation with Governor Romney was very productive, but I intend to keep lines of communication open with him and his campaign,&quot; Santorum wrote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope to ensure that the values that made America that shining city on the hill are illuminated brightly by our party and our candidates, thus ensuring not just a victory, but a mandate for conservative governance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santorum dropped out of the race in the weeks before the Pennsylvania primary with millions of dollars in campaign debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Santorum's endorsement, Romney has landed the backing of all but two of his challengers - Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul. Paul remains in the race.          </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Nia-Malika Henderson       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                    Obama makes big ad buy           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign began the week by announcing a whopping $25 million ad buy in nine battleground states - and its top strategists told reporters that the buy is only the beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not letting our foot off the pedal,&quot; campaign manager Jim Messina said during a conference call with reporters Monday. &quot;We have a very simple choice between going forward and going back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messina, along with senior strategist David Axelrod, told reporters that the ad, called &quot;Go,&quot; is part of a larger campaign effort to convey all that President Obama has done since taking office in the midst of an economic crisis and two wars in January 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Axelrod said the president's decision to talk positively about his record on the auto industry bailout, winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, going after al-Qaeda and other achievements contrasts starkly with the strategy of his presumed Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, to blame the nation's continuing economic difficulties on the current administration without offering credible solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're in a different place,&quot; Axelrod said. &quot;We're fighting our way through. There are still significant headwinds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Axelrod didn't rule out the need to respond to Romney's attacks - and those of independent Republican super PACs, to which he said the Obama campaign will respond &quot;vigorously&quot; and treat &quot;as an ad from Governor Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Axelrod went so far as to describe David and Charles Koch, the conservative brothers who have bankrolled several anti-Obama efforts, including the free-market group Americans for Prosperity, as &quot;contract killers over there in super PAC land who are going to continue to pound away on behalf of Governor Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This summer looks like it may be slightly weaker than we thought it was going to be,&quot; Morse said. &quot;But it's still a tight market, and summer gasoline is hard for refiners to make.  We don't think the worst is over for consumers, and I'd be surprised if there is not another price pickup before the July Fourth weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reversal of the Seaway oil pipeline, which runs from Oklahoma to refineries along the Gulf Coast, would ease the bottleneck at Cushing, Okla., and raise prices there. The Cushing oil terminal is where the New York Mercantile Exchange prices its benchmark crude. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The global oil supply picture has been less dire than many oil traders expected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Higher Saudi oil production has offset declines in Iran's oil exports. These have been impeded by Europe's decision to impose an embargo on imports from Iran and by the tightening of U.S. financial sanctions worldwide against companies buying oil from Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Morse noted, Iraqi oil production and exports hit recent highs in April. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supplies have been disrupted by local fighting in the Sudans, Syria, Yemen and Nigeria. And Iran remains a major wild card.  For now, however, geopolitical anxieties have eased. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greely said there is little premium in the oil price due to fears of a conflict over Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems like the concerns over Iran have receded into the background a little bit,&quot; he said. &quot;The market has been much more focused on the economy. In both Washington and Iran, the rhetoric has died down a little bit.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global demand remains uncertain, given the debate over austerity in Europe and signs that China's breakneck growth may be slowing somewhat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, now that Japan has closed all of its 54 nuclear power plants in the wake of last year's tsunami, the Asian economic giant is importing 300,000 to 400,000 barrels of fuel oil a day. Several other countries have been building up inventories, which were drawn down in Europe during the conflict in Libya last year. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Santorum, who bowed out of the Republican presidential nominating contest after capturing 11 states and some 3 million votes, endorsed his erstwhile rival Mitt Romney on Monday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to his supporters, the former Pennsylvania senator said that he was impressed with Romney's &quot;commitment to economic policies that preserve and strengthen families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He clearly understands that having pro-family initiatives are not only the morally and economically right thing to do, but that the family is the basic building block of our society and must be preserved,&quot; Santorum wrote in the letter e-mailed to supporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The endorsement comes as Romney looks to shore up his support among conservatives, who powered Santorum to victory in several states, particularly in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Romney and Santorum met for an hour in Pittsburgh, where the former Pennsylvania senator urged Romney to hire conservatives to work on his campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the primary, Santorum was one of Romney's harshest critics, suggesting that he was unelectable because of his more centrist views and the health-care reform he enacted while governor of Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Santorum, who resurrected his career with his surprisingly strong  challenge of Romney, said that he was satisfied that the presumptive Republican candidate would overturn the Obama administration's health-care reform law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My conversation with Governor Romney was very productive, but I intend to keep lines of communication open with him and his campaign,&quot; Santorum wrote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope to ensure that the values that made America that shining city on the hill are illuminated brightly by our party and our candidates, thus ensuring not just a victory, but a mandate for conservative governance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santorum dropped out of the race in the weeks before the Pennsylvania primary with millions of dollars in campaign debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Santorum's endorsement, Romney has landed the backing of all but two of his challengers - Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul. Paul remains in the race.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign began the week by announcing a whopping $25 million ad buy in nine battleground states - and its top strategists told reporters that the buy is only the beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not letting our foot off the pedal,&quot; campaign manager Jim Messina said during a conference call with reporters Monday. &quot;We have a very simple choice between going forward and going back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messina, along with senior strategist David Axelrod, told reporters that the ad, called &quot;Go,&quot; is part of a larger campaign effort to convey all that President Obama has done since taking office in the midst of an economic crisis and two wars in January 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Axelrod said the president's decision to talk positively about his record on the auto industry bailout, winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, going after al-Qaeda and other achievements contrasts starkly with the strategy of his presumed Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, to blame the nation's continuing economic difficulties on the current administration without offering credible solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're in a different place,&quot; Axelrod said. &quot;We're fighting our way through. There are still significant headwinds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Axelrod didn't rule out the need to respond to Romney's attacks - and those of independent Republican super PACs, to which he said the Obama campaign will respond &quot;vigorously&quot; and treat &quot;as an ad from Governor Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Axelrod went so far as to describe David and Charles Koch, the conservative brothers who have bankrolled several anti-Obama efforts, including the free-market group Americans for Prosperity, as &quot;contract killers over there in super PAC land who are going to continue to pound away on behalf of Governor Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign will begin an extensive advertising campaign this week in nine battleground states, part of a broader effort by the president to frame his first term around a narrative of momentum and unfinished progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's argument to voters, summed up in the new 60-second commercial: let me finish the job. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign did not immediately release the cost of this latest ad buy but said it would be significant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial begins with a retelling of the events that led to the Great Recession, events that an announcer reminds viewers actually began before Mr. Obama took office: worst financial collapse since the Great Depression; 4.4 million jobs lost; stock market plummets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some said our best days were behind us. He believed in us. He fought for us,&quot; the announcer says before reciting a list of the president's accomplishments, like the auto industry rescue and the killing of Osama bin Laden. &quot;But we're coming back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's political strategists believe that it is important to  counter the criticism coming from Mitt Romney and Republicans that Mr. Obama had his chance to turn the country around but failed to do so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you tell the story from the other side, it's that one day the president showed up to a blank slate and now things aren't good,&quot; said Larry Grisolano, director of paid media for the Obama campaign. &quot;Having  that narrative, knowing the complete story is essential to making the right judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
