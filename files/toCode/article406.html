  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This advertisement for Senator John McCain is the third this week in which he addresses the nation's financial crisis. Called ''Foundation,'' it is 30 seconds long and will be broadcast nationally. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PRODUCER Foxhole Productions</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE SCRIPT Voice of Mr. McCain: ''You, the American workers, are the best in the world. But your economic security has been put at risk by the greed of Wall Street. That's unacceptable. My opponent's only solutions are talk and taxes. I'll reform Wall Street and fix Washington. I've taken on tougher guys than this before.'' Announcer's voice: ''Change is coming. John McCain.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE SCREEN Against a dark background, Mr. McCain addresses the camera. As he speaks, scenes from the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange flash across the screen, followed by a street sign that says Wall Street. Then it is back to Mr. McCain, whose image gives way to that of Senator Barack Obama, with his running mate, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., in the background. Mr. McCain speaks to viewers one last time before the screen dissolves to a still photograph of him, accompanied by the phrase ''The Original Maverick.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ACCURACY According to a 2007 study by the International Labor Organization, workers in Norway are the world's most productive (when measured on an hourly basis), followed by the United States and France. Mr. Obama has offered detailed proposals on the economy, for stemming the mortgage default crisis and channeling investment into activities that will generate new jobs. He would raise capital gains taxes as well as income and Social Security taxes on those earning more than $250,000 a year, but the notion that he would also increase taxes on middle-class voters has been repeatedly debunked. Studies have found that Mr. Obama would offer most Americans a tax cut three times the size of what Mr. McCain proposes. Finally, Mr. McCain's record has favored deregulation of the financial industry, a factor that analysts say has contributed to the credit crisis, and opposed creation of a government agency to oversee Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SCORECARD Mr. McCain got himself into trouble on Monday by arguing that ''the fundamentals of our economy are strong'' despite the Wall Street crisis. This advertisement is an effort to rebound from that much-criticized statement with a populist appeal that echoes Mr. Obama's mantra of ''change.'' In addition, Mr. McCain seems to be evoking his history as a prisoner of war to underline his argument that he has more experience than Mr. Obama and is therefore more qualified to be president. But he has on occasion also acknowledged that economics is not his strongest suit, so with the financial markets drifting into uncharted waters, it is hard to tell if the experience argument will convince voters.
