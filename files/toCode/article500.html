  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The presidential campaigns of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain accused each other of lying Monday after McCain's team released its latest commercial.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Called Original Mavericks, the 30-second ad makes the case that it is Arizona Sen. McCain and running mate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin who will bring &quot;real change&quot; to Washington. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The script</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Narrator: &quot;The original mavericks. He fights pork-barrel spending. She stopped the 'Bridge to Nowhere.' He took on the drug industry. She took on big oil. He battled Republicans and reformed Washington. She battled Republicans and reformed Alaska.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;They'll make history. They'll change Washington.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;McCain. Palin. Real change.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The images</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad begins with the faces of McCain and Palin, together -- to reinforce the message that they are a team. An American flag is in the background.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Then, as the narrator runs through the statements about each person, the images flip from McCain to Palin and back again.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As the ad comes to its end, the two are together again.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Reality check</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's the claim that Palin &quot;stopped the 'Bridge to Nowhere'&quot; that sparked the dispute. The reference is to a proposed bridge to a remote Alaskan community that would have cost the U.S. government more than $200.million Palin has said repeatedly that she told the federal government: &quot;Thanks, but no thanks.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a candidate for governor, however, Palin supported the bridge.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We need to come to the defense of southeast Alaska when proposals are on the table, like the bridge, and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something that's so negative,&quot; Palin said in August 2006, according to the Ketchikan Daily News.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The non-partisan FactCheck.org has called Palin's claim that she blocked the project &quot;a bridge too far.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When the ad was released, Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton issued a statement accusing McCain's campaign of repeating a &quot;lie.&quot; McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers issued a statement calling Burton's claim a &quot;hysterical&quot; attack and saying it was the Obama team that was lying because Palin &quot;ultimately canceled the wasteful project.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Where it's playing</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain campaign says Original Mavericks will run on some national cable networks and in some of the so-called battleground states, where the race is expected to be close. <br /></span></p>
