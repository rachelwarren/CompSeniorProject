  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Titled ''Article,'' this 30-second advertisement for Senator Barack Obama will be broadcast on national cable television, according to his campaign. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PRODUCER Obama media team. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE SCRIPT A narrator says: ''We've seen what Bush-McCain policies have done to our economy. Now John McCain wants to do the same to our health care. McCain just published an article praising Wall Street deregulation. Said he'd reduce oversight of the health insurance industry, too. Just 'as we have done over the last decade in banking.' Increasing costs and threatening coverage. A prescription for disaster. John McCain. A risk we just can't afford to take.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ON THE SCREEN The advertisement opens with a split-screen image: on top is a photograph of Senator John McCain with President Bush. On the bottom are the logos of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Fannie Mae, all symbols of the crisis on Wall Street. The spot attributes the sour economy to ''Bush-McCain policies,'' and then the words ''McCain wants to do the same to health care'' appear on the screen. Next is an image of an article by Mr. McCain in Contingencies magazine in which he promotes letting Americans buy health insurance across state lines, drawing a parallel to the relaxation of rules governing the banking industry. The spot ends with a photograph of Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain with the president's arm around him. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ACCURACY The advertisement makes a leap in drawing implicit parallels between Mr. McCain's health care proposals and the deregulation of the banking sector and then tying the deregulation to the financial crisis. Writing in Contingencies, Mr. McCain said, ''Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.'' While the Obama campaign is linking the ability to buy insurance across state lines to banking deregulation, the changes that allowed banks to operate across state lines were viewed by many as having benefited consumers by encouraging competition, and those changes have not been linked to the current crisis. A spokesman for Mr. McCain, Tucker Bounds, called such parallels false. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SCORECARD The advertisement successfully seizes on Mr. McCain's advocacy for less regulation at a time when financial institutions are collapsing and the government is moving to step in with a bailout estimated at $700 billion. But by making questionable assertions about the roots of the crisis and then making a link to Mr. McCain's health care plans, Mr. Obama opens himself to the same criticism that Mr. McCain has faced about the truthfulness of his attacks.
