  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The presidential nominees have poured more than $15 million into television advertising since the end of the parties' national political conventions, mostly in a handful of battleground states in the Midwest, according to a study released Wednesday by the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the week after the Republican convention, Senator Barack Obama spent $7.7 million on advertisements in 17 states, while Senator John McCain spent $7.8 million on spots in 15 states. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Fifty-six percent of the commercials from Mr. McCain were negative, and 77 percent of those from Mr. Obama were negative, the study found. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain spent roughly the same amount in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, but Mr. Obama outspent Mr. McCain in nearly every other state. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Bush made his only appearances in commercials for Mr. Obama, where he was mentioned alongside Mr. McCain every time Mr. McCain appeared. Mr. Bush was not mentioned in any McCain spots. JULIE BOSMAN </span></p>
