  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Presidential campaigns have never been genteel debates over policy disagreements, but what's really disappointing about this one is that candidates who promised that this would somehow be a better and more substantive discussion have given in to the same imperatives that turned other campaigns ugly, abandoning honest attacks for distortion and outright falsehoods.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Don't take our word for it. Truth-squadding candidates' assertions has become a full-time business for journalists and has raised the profile of at least two straight-shooting websites -- FactCheck.org and PolitiFact.com -- that measure candidates' statements against the facts. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A fair reading of all the fact-checking shows that both Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama have stepped over the line dozens of times and keep doing it. That same fair reading suggests that while both nominees are guilty of sometimes outrageous falsehoods, McCain -- who has prided himself on &quot;straight talk&quot; and took the high road when scurrilous attacks helped cost him the GOP presidential nomination in 2000 -- has crossed the line more often and more egregiously.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This isn't about ending negative advertising, which is sometimes helpful. It's perfectly fair for a candidate to point out his opponent's deficiencies. McCain hit Obama for taking more campaign money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than almost any other member of Congress when those two institutions were trying to avoid stricter regulation. The money came not from the firms but their employees, but it's still a fair shot.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What's not fair, and what demeans the candidates when they do it, are statements that flatly misrepresent their opponent's positions or their own. Fact-checking websites pride themselves on neutrality and avoid comparing the candidates' mendacity, but we toted up Politifact.com's ratings and found McCain beats Obama about 5 to 3.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Five of the worst from both candidates:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*McCain on Obama and taxes. McCain has repeatedly implied that Obama wants to raise taxes on every taxpayer. A total distortion, fact-checkers say, noting that Obama would actually cut taxes on low- and middle-income people more than McCain would. Obama would raise taxes -- but on the sort of upper-income people (such as families making more than $250,000 a year) who would get the biggest tax breaks from McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*Obama on McCain and Social Security. Obama distorted the effects of President Bush's proposal to partially privatize Social Security (which McCain supported), charging that it would cut retirees' benefits in half and implying that it would leave current retirees' benefits to the mercy of the stock market. FactCheck.org points out that no current retirees would have been affected by the Bush plan, and even future retirees wouldn't have had their benefits cut in half.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*McCain on Obama and sex education. A widely derided McCain TV spot charges that Obama supported sex education for children as young as kindergarteners. Fact-checkers dismantling the ad's script found little if anything that was true. Obama supported warning kids about predators and backed an opt-out provision for parents.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*Obama on McCain and immigration. Politifact.com awards Obama his only &quot;pants on fire&quot; lie (McCain gets six) for a Spanish-language TV spot that grossly distorts McCain's immigration position by falsely tying McCain to out-of-context comments from talk radio host Rush Limbaugh. McCain favored a bipartisan approach that Congress defeated.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*McCain on Palin. McCain says his vice presidential running mate, Sarah Palin, never sought earmarks as governor of Alaska. In fact, her administration sought 83 earmarks worth $453 million for 2008 and 2009. McCain and Palin both say she rejected the infamous &quot;bridge to nowhere&quot; earmark. In fact, she supported the bridge until it lost support in Washington. The state kept the money anyway.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What's worse than being ignorant of the truth is being indifferent to it -- repeating falsehoods after they've been pointed out. After McCain's claims are revealed to be false (earmarks and taxes, for example), he often repeats them anyway. Obama has changed some of his false assertions, though not all.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Before this campaign began, both candidates had records of avoiding the low road, and with so many differences between them, they shouldn't need to travel that path. When they do, they're essentially saying that they can't win on merit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain campaign declined to provide an opposing view to this editorial. <br /><br />Political Pinocchios</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">PolitiFact.com rates candidates' statements on a six-category scale from &quot;true&quot; to &quot;pants on fire&quot; falsehoods. Their analysis suggests that while both presidential candidates have stretched or ignored the truth, Republican John McCain has done that more often than Democrat Barack Obama:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*Barely true</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain -- 22</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama -- 14</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*False</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain -- 23</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama -- 18</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*Pants on fire</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain -- 6</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama -- 1</span></p>
