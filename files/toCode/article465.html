  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After days of sharp attacks against each other, Senators John McCain and Barack Obama suspended all political combat on Thursday, including television commercials, and instead made joint visits to ground zero and a forum on public service in New York to mark the seventh anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At one point, Mr. McCain, who spoke first at the nighttime forum at Columbia University, defended his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, for recently making fun of Mr. Obama's work years ago as a community organizer. He said that Ms. Palin made her comment in reaction to Democratic attacks on her relative inexperience as a first-term governor and a former mayor of a small Alaskan town, Wasilla. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Of course I respect community organizers, of course I respect people who serve their community, and Senator Obama's record there is outstanding,'' said Mr. McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, before adding, ''I think a small-town mayor has very great responsibilities.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, said in his appearance that while he deeply respected mayors, ''I was surprised by several remarks around community organizing, and belittling it.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''It taught me,'' he said, ''that ordinary people can do extraordinary things, when they're given a chance and brought together. I want every young person to recognize that they will not fulfill their potential until they hitch their wagon to something bigger.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Both candidates did agree on a politically divisive issue: They urged universities like Columbia to reverse Vietnam-era bans on Reserved Officers Training Corps activities. Some schools continue the bans in reaction to the military's policy on gays and lesbians -- a policy that Mr. Obama has pledged to lift and that Mr. McCain has said he would continue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Shouldn't the students here be exposed to the attractiveness of serving in the military, particularly as officers?'' said Mr. McCain, of Arizona, who attended the United States Naval Academy. ''I would hope that these universities would re-examine that policy.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Asked if Columbia, his alma mater, should reinstate ROTC, Mr. Obama said: ''I think we've made a mistake on that. I recognize that there are students here who have differences in terms of military policy, but the notion that young people here at Columbia aren't offered a choice or an option in participating in military service is a mistake.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Outside of the forum, on the steps of Low Memorial Library, students cheered loudly when Mr. McCain talked about Columbia's unwillingness to let ROTC on campus and then booed when he mentioned the option of serving as a military officer. When Mr. Obama proposed allowing ROTC back on campus, meanwhile, the students remained largely silent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> While Mr. Obama made no campaign appearances on Thursday, he did not entirely halt campaign-related activities: He shared a 90-minute lunch in Harlem with former President Bill Clinton, intended, in part, to soothe any ill will left from the bitter Democratic primary campaign between Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Advisers to the two men said afterward that the meeting was cordial and that Mr. Clinton urged Mr. Obama, of Illinois, to keep his political message focused on economic issues.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The meeting took place in Mr. Clinton's 14th-floor office on 125th Street, and they took a few questions from reporters. Mr. Clinton said he had agreed to do ''a substantial number of things'' on behalf of Mr. Obama this fall, and would hit the campaign trail as soon as his Global Initiative conference concluded on Sept. 26.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''We're putting him to work,'' Mr. Obama joked. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Asked for his opinion about the state of the presidential race, Mr. Clinton replied, ''I predict that Senator Obama will win and win handily.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''There you go,'' Mr. Obama said. ''You can take it from the president of the United States. He knows a little something about politics.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Yet the main event of the day was a moment when no words were exchanged: It was the image, rather, of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain walking shoulder-to-shoulder down a long ramp at ground zero. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The two appeared somber throughout their 15 minutes together, chatting briefly on the ramp. At the bottom, they greeted a small receiving line of uniformed officers and relatives of victims. Each man also took a rose and placed the flower on a reflecting pool. They stood silent for a few moments, each clasping his own fingers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At the end of their 15-minute public detente, Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama shook hands, and Mr. McCain could be heard saying, ''All right, sir, see you soon.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The idea for the rivals to appear together at ground zero originated last week during a telephone conversation between the men. When Mr. Obama called Mr. McCain to congratulate him on accepting the presidential nomination, aides to both men said, Mr. Obama proposed the idea and Mr. McCain accepted. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The breather from minute-by-minute politicking comes after several days of intensifying tension and attacks between the McCain and Obama camps, in large part over Ms. Palin's leadership style and record. She is under scrutiny for her inconsistent positions on Congressional earmarks and her motives in dismissing the Alaska public safety commissioner, among other things.</span></p>
