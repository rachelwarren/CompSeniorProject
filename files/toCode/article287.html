  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">THE AD</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Three-quarters of a million jobs lost this year. Our financial system in turmoil. And John McCain? Erratic in a crisis. Out of touch on the economy. No wonder his campaign's announced a plan to &quot;turn a page on the financial crisis&quot; by launching dishonest, dishonorable &quot;assaults&quot; against Barack Obama. Struggling families can't turn the page on this economy. And we can't afford another president who's this out of touch. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ANALYSIS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This Barack Obama&nbsp;ad uses some disingenuous sleight of hand to convey the impression that The Washington Post is calling John McCain's campaign untruthful.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The commercial is largely accurate, using newspaper excerpts to buttress the impression that the senator from Arizona was less than steady in responding to the Wall Street crisis (while showing McCain in a golf cart). As McCain first said the economy's fundamentals were sound, then ratcheted up his rhetoric and plunged into congressional bailout talks, a USA Today editorial called his conduct &quot;erratic&quot; and &quot;out of touch.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad doesn't mention that the same editorial said, &quot;Granted, Democrat Barack Obama also has scant experience dealing with financial crises.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A Post news article Saturday -- a facsimile of which is pictured in the ad -- did say that McCain and his GOP allies are readying a newly aggressive assault on Obama's judgment, honesty and personal associations, and it quoted a McCain aide talking about turning a page on the financial crisis. But when the narrator talks about &quot;dishonest, dishonorable assaults&quot; against the senator from Illinois, the first two words are the Obama campaign's, not The Post's. While the on-screen graphic says &quot; 'assault' on Obama,&quot; the narrator's words run together in a way that could easily mislead the casual viewer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With its images of a Wall Street trading floor and an &quot;average&quot; family, the spot attempts to play on economic anxieties, a strong issue for Obama, and depict McCain (who, as usual, is pictured with President Bush) as disconnected from those problems. At the same time, the ad, which was leaked yesterday, tries to inoculate Obama against future McCain&nbsp;commercials that may play up his links to convicted businessman Antoin &quot;Tony&quot; Rezko and onetime terrorist William Ayers.</span></p>
