  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This advertisement for the Republican ticket of Senator John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin is scheduled to be broadcast in what the McCain campaign describes as key states, though as of late Friday it had run only once, in Denver on Sept. 10. Called ''Disrespectful,'' it is 30 seconds long. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PRODUCER Foxhole Productions</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SCRIPT ''He was the world's biggest celebrity, but his star is fading. So they lashed out at Sarah Palin. Dismissed her as 'good looking.' That backfired, so they said she was doing 'what she was told.' Then desperately called Sarah Palin a liar. How disrespectful. And how Gov. Sarah Palin proves them wrong, every day.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE SCREEN Senator Barack Obama is shown at a lectern, gesticulating, with crowd noises in the background and cameras flashing as a female voice speaks. Next, head shots of Mr. Obama and his running mate, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., fill the screen. As the accusations against Mr. Obama roll across the screen, his face alone appears, intermittently smiling, fretful or frowning. The final image is that of a smiling Mr. McCain standing at Ms. Palin's side as she speaks at a public event.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ACCURACY Mr. Obama is pictured when the phrase ''good looking'' appears on the screen, but it was actually Mr. Biden who made the remark, and clearly in a self-deprecating context. The Obama adviser accused of saying Ms. Palin was doing what she was told merely said that she might have been fed misinformation about Mr. Obama and repeated it. An Obama advertisement does accuse both Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin of ''lying'' about their records, in her case as regards her claimed opposition to the so-called bridge to nowhere, which she opposed only once it became a symbol of wasteful spending. And this is the second McCain advertisement to call Mr. Obama ''the world's biggest celebrity,'' a contention that will no doubt come as a surprise to several actors and athletes, and seems odd at a moment when Ms. Palin is omnipresent on television and in newspapers and magazines.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SCORECARD The advertisement is the latest in a number that resort to a dubious disregard for the facts. The nonpartisan political analysis group Factcheck.org has already criticized ''Disrespectful'' as ''particularly egregious,'' saying that it ''goes down new paths of deception,'' and is ''peddling false quotes.'' Even the title is troublesome. ''Disrespectful'' is one of those words that is loaded with racial and class connotations that many people consider offensive.</span></p>
