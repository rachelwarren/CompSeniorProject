  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Thank you to Brent Staples for shedding light on the language of race (''Barack Obama, John McCain and the Language of Race,'' Editorial Observer, Sept. 22).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> No one has yet called Senator Barack Obama ''uppity,'' but it now appears that the aloofness that is attributed to him may have a similar objective of putting him ''in his place.'' Oh, the power of language!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The polls that refer lately to the preference for John McCain among white working-class men demonstrate that racism is alive and well in this country. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> We may be better off to address the issue of race head on rather than pretend that it is not a factor in this election. Mr. Staples points out correctly that Mr. Obama ''seems to understand that he is always an utterance away from a statement -- or a phrase -- that could transform him ... into the archetypical angry black man who scares off the white vote.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Pity us all, and the rest of the world, for it looks as if we may once again lose the opportunity to be led by a thinking individual.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> To the Editor:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Brent Staples's article eloquently and succinctly puts a fine point on the issue: the language of the Republicans in this election reminds us that race is still the ''elephant'' in our nation's living room.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The ghosts of Nixon's ''Southern strategy''; Ronald Reagan's Cadillac-driving ''welfare queen'' and his ''states' rights'' speech in Philadelphia, Miss.; and Bush 41's ''Willie Horton'' ad turn out not to be ghosts after all; they are zombies that just won't die.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In my 60 years as an ''uppity'' black man in America, I have seen our nation do things both good and bad. What saddens me most is the willingness of some to exploit racist fears rather than confront, condemn and disavow all vestiges -- and proponents -- of this constant stain on our history, our nation and our promise for the future. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> To the Editor:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Brent Staples's Editorial Observer about the language of race sent a chill down my 70-year-old spine.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> My two brothers and I were raised in the Deep South (Tallahassee) in the 1940s by a ''Lincoln Republican'' mother from Iowa. She insisted that we address all adults as ''sir'' or ''ma'am'' regardless of race, and she always inquired as to the surname. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On Lincoln's Birthday and Emancipation Proclamation Day (Sept. 22), she drove us in our 1937 Chevrolet out the Thomasville Road to a segregated school or church (''coloreds'' only) to mark our observance. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It is hard to believe that today the party of Lincoln would be guilty of the same misconduct our mother told us was un-American.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> To the Editor:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Brent Staples was brave to bring to our attention the racism inherent in opponents' attempts to characterize Barack Obama as elite and arrogant, and to lampoon his glamour and celebrity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Uppity'' is an old, subtle and deeply buried characterization, as he writes, but not one limited to the South. Political campaigns since before the beginning of the Republic have chosen their rhetoric and images shrewdly, with an eye to code. Today's are no different. </span></p>
