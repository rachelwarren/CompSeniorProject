  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The first presidential debate garnered an average of 52.4 million television viewers on Friday, Nielsen Media Research said on Monday. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The relatively low audience estimate puzzled some television executives who expected a wider audience for the commercial-free forum between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama. The debate drew eight million fewer viewers than the first debate between President Bush and Senator John Kerry in 2004, but attracted six million more viewers than the second debate that year, which was also held on a Friday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Of the 11 broadcast and cable networks that showed the McCain-Obama debate, ABC reached the most viewers, with an average of 11 million. Among other broadcasters, CBS had an average audience of 7.6 million and NBC had an average of 7.1 million. On cable, an average of 8.2 million people watched the Fox News Channel, 7.1 million watched CNN and 3.9 million watched MSNBC. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Nielsen's estimates do not include viewing parties outside the home, reruns or Internet streams of the debate. C-Span's video of the debate drew more than half a million views on YouTube.</span></p>
