  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yes, immigration is a complicated and combustible issue for political candidates -- and the economic meltdown is everyone's top priority. No, that is no excuse for ignoring immigration or lying about it to voters, as John McCain and Barack Obama have been doing. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain lied first, in a Spanish-language ad that accused Mr. Obama of helping to kill immigration reform last year, by voting for amendments that supposedly doomed a bipartisan bill. The ad lamented the result: ''No guest worker program. No path to citizenship. No secure borders. No reform. Is that being on our side?''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> That is a jaw-dropping distortion. The bill wasn't killed by any amendments. It was killed by a firestorm of talk-radio rage and a Republican-led filibuster. The very bill that Mr. McCain now mourns is the one he sidled away from as his own party weakened and killed it. It's the one he says he would now vote against.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For Mr. McCain to suggest that Mr. Obama opposes the ''path to citizenship'' and ''guest worker program'' compounds his dishonesty. Mr. Obama supports the three pillars of comprehensive reform -- tougher enforcement, expanded legal immigration and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already here.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain was an architect of just such a comprehensive bill. But he is also leading a party whose members rabidly oppose the path to citizenship. So, in deference to them, Mr. McCain now emphasizes border security as the utmost priority. Except when he's pandering in Spanish. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama's retaliatory ad, also in Spanish, was just as fraudulent. It slimed Mr. McCain as a friend and full-bore ally of restrictionists like Rush Limbaugh, even though Mr. Limbaugh has long attacked Mr. McCain's immigration moderation. It quotes Mr. Limbaugh as calling all Mexicans stupid and ordering them to ''shut your mouth or get out,'' which he never did. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Immigration was broken before the candidates started this repugnant ad war, and looks as if it will stay that way for at least the duration of this campaign. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Meanwhile, the Bush administration keeps raiding factories and farms, terrorizing immigrant families while exposing horrific accounts of workplace abuses. Children toil in slaughterhouses; detainees languish in federal lockups, dying without decent medical care. Day laborers are harassed and robbed of wages. An ineffective border fence is behind schedule and millions over budget. Local enforcers drag citizens and legal residents into their nets, to the cheers of the Minutemen. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Both candidates once espoused smart, thoughtful positions for fixing the problem. But Mr. McCain is shuffling in step with his restrictionist party. Mr. Obama gave immigration one brief mention at the Democratic convention, in a litany of big-trouble issues, like abortion, guns and same-sex marriage, on which he seemed to say that the best Americans could hope for are small compromises and to agree to disagree.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> They're both wrong. The country needs to hear better answers, stated clearly and forthrightly over the shouting. The answer to immigration is what it was last year: comprehensive reform that extends order and the rule of law to a system that is broken in a million complex ways. Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama both know this. They should get back to telling the truth about it, in English and in Spanish.</span></p>
