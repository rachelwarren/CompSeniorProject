  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The financial bailout plan could draw both presidential candidates to Washington. But by midweek, the political front will be shifting to Missouri, where the vice-presidential nominees, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, will participate in their only debate. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> They will be off the campaign trail most of the week, preparing for the showdown, which is scheduled for 9 p.m. Thursday, Eastern time, at Washington University in St. Louis. Gwen Ifill of PBS will moderate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Will Ms. Palin, the Republican nominee, display enough command of the issues to convince voters that she is qualified to move into the Naval Observatory, the vice president's residence, in January? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Will Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee, avoid gaffes and exhibit enough self-control to keep him out of Republican campaign commercials?&nbsp;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If the presidential debate last week is any indication, millions of American households will be tuned in to see.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Meantime, unless they shift course for a bailout package vote, the presidential candidates this week will continue their travels.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> John McCain: Columbus, Ohio (with Ms. Palin); Des Moines; Washington; and Los Angeles.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Barack Obama: Denver; Reno, Nev.; and the La Crosse area of Wisconsin.</span></p>
