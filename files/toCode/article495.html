  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Bush administration formally withdrew an agreement for civilian nuclear cooperation with Russia from congressional consideration on Monday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''The president has notified Congress that he has today rescinded his prior determination regarding the U.S.-Russia agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation,'' the State Department said in a prepared statement. ''We make this decision with regret.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The step is the most meaningful show of displeasure the United States has yet made over Russia's military action in Georgia. But it stops short of the more aggressive measures that some have proposed. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The White House has stepped up economic aid to Georgia, but it has so far ruled out providing military assistance. Similarly, the White House has not sought to impose economic sanctions against Russia or to revoke its membership in the Group of Eight, despite the strong warnings tha American officials issued as the crisis was unfolding that Russia would face consequences for its actions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Withdrawing the pact from congressional consideration is a less definitive step than canceling it; withdrawal leaves open the possibility that this administration or a successor could resubmit the agreement to Congress if tensions subside. And the pact's chances of winning approval any time soon had already grown cloudy. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''After Russia's invasion of Georgia, it's not appropriate at this time'' to go ahead with the pact, a senior administration official said earlier on Monday, discussing the agreement on grounds of anonymity because the official announcement of the withdrawal had not yet been made.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The announcement came the same day that a European delegation in Moscow said it had received Russian reassurances concerning Georgia and its intentions there.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The withdrawal of the pact, which was submitted to Congress in May, could cost Russia billions of dollars in potential earnings, but will also unravel a program that is central to President George W. Bush's hopes of safely spreading the use of civilian nuclear energy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The agreement would have cleared the way for extensive commercial nuclear trade, technology transfers and joint nuclear research between the two countries. And it would have allowed Russia to move forward with the lucrative business of importing, storing and possibly reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from U.S.-supplied reactors around the world.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''The Russians have some very ambitious goals in developing their civilian nuclear reactor export industry,'' said Andrew Kuchins, director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, ''and to get to some of the newer markets, they have to have the United States stamp of approval.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Michael O'Hanlon, a national security specialist with the Brookings Institution, said the deal should be viewed primarily as a commercial one. ''It's not trivial,'' he said, in evaluating the impact of its withdrawal. ''But it's also not the breadbasket of Russia.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> American officials have made clear the depth of their displeasure over Russia's brief war with Georgia. Vice President Dick Cheney, speaking Saturday at a conference in Italy after visiting Georgia, asked, called Russia's action an ''affront to civilized standards.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But officials also acknowledge the importance of Russian cooperation with the United States on a range of sensitive topics. Ultimately, the senior administration official said, ''the focus is trying to get back to a good relationship.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The nuclear cooperation agreement had already faced skepticism from American lawmakers who are angry at Russia for, among other things, resisting the imposition of tougher international sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Russia-Georgia clash in early August appears to have ended any remaining chance it had of passage, at least for now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Its chances to pass before Aug. 8 were going to be a challenge, and after Aug. 8, they're zero,'' said Mr. Kuchins. The withdrawal of the accord, he said, is ''a recognition of the political reality.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In a statement, Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, underlined the depth of congressional skepticism. ''Even without Russia's incursion into Georgia,'' he said, ''Russian support for Iranian nuclear and missile programs alone is enough to call into question the wisdom of committing to a 30-year agreement to transfer sensitive nuclear technologies and materials to Russia.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Dingell said his committee would continue to monitor Russian support for Iranian nuclear programs. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, has angrily denounced the Russian action in Georgia and has called for ousting Russia from the Group of Eight. Mr. McCain also favors blocking Russian aspirations to join the World Trade Organization.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> His Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama, has said that Russia's application to the trade group should be reviewed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Unfortunately, the tendency right now on both sides is a strong momentum to kind of throw out the baby with the bathwater,'' Mr. Kuchins said. ''The Russians immediately announced that they're going to not abide by some W.T.O. accession agreements; they've bailed on NATO-Russia cooperation; and we respond by withdrawing the civilian nuclear cooperation agreement. It's a bad action-reaction cycle.''</span></p>
