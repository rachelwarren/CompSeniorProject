  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Memo to Senator Barack Obama: It could be dangerous to mess with the national pastime.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Yet that is what Mr. Obama has possibly done in buying a 30-minute block of time on Oct. 29 on three networks, including Fox, which happens to be running the World Series. Because of the ad, Major League Baseball has agreed to push back the first pitch if there is a Game 6 that night. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> That immediately drew the rebuke of the Republican National Committee, which portrayed the ad buy as another example of Mr. Obama's putting himself first. (The theme of Senator John McCain is ''Country First.'')</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''It's unfortunate that the World Series' first pitch is being delayed for Obama's political pitch,'' Alex Conant, a spokesman for the R.N.C., said in a statement. He added later, via instant message, of Mr. Obama: ''He puts himself first -- literally.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But Scott Grogin, a spokesman for the Fox Broadcasting Company, said Wednesday that it was the network that made the request to Major League Baseball to delay the start of Game 6 by 20 minutes. The network did so after Fox received the request from the Obama campaign to buy the block of time, at a cost of nearly $1 million. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Grogin added that the network would be willing to make time available to Mr. McCain's campaign, if requested. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Of course, if the series is decided in four or five games, the schedule change would not be necessary. ''If there's no Game 6,'' Mr. Grogin said, ''It'll air at 8 p.m. in lieu of other programming.'' JULIE BOSMAN </span></p>
