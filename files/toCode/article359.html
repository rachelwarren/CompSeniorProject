  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This 30-second advertisement for Senator Barack Obama, titled ''Promise,'' began running last week in battleground states across the country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PRODUCER Obama media team. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE SCRIPT Mr. Obama says, ''I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this message.'' Over the sound of morose piano chords, a female narrator begins: ''A broken economy. Failing banks. Unstable markets. Families struggling. To protect us in retirement, Social Security has never been more important. But John McCain has voted three times in favor of privatizing Social Security. McCain says, 'I campaigned in support of President Bush's proposal.' Cutting benefits in half. Risking Social Security on the stock market. The Bush-McCain privatization plan. Can you really afford more of the same?'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE SCREEN The spot opens with an image of Mr. Obama and his running mate, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., followed by a headline from The Wall Street Journal, ''Crisis on Wall Street.'' Another headline, this time from The Washington Post, follows, proclaiming that the ''Dow Dives 500 Points on Banking Turmoil,'' while images of frenzied Wall Street traders are shown in the background. Then the spot shows a video of a gray-haired couple walking together, smiling, with trees in the background, only to cut abruptly to an elderly woman alone, looking somberly into the camera. At the first mention of Mr. McCain's name, he appears side by side with President Bush. Then the two are seen emerging from the White House and, finally, standing together in the Rose Garden.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ACCURACY Since this spot began running, the Obama campaign has been accused of ''scare tactics'' from the McCain campaign and criticized as falsely stating Mr. McCain's position on Social Security benefits. The Web site FactCheck.org focused on the advertisement's claim that a 2005 proposal from Mr. Bush would cut Social Security benefits in half, calling it a ''rank misrepresentation.'' In fact, Mr. Bush's proposal did call for cuts to Social Security benefits, but the cuts would be imposed gradually on future retirees, not those currently receiving benefits, and would affect the highest earners the most. According to a report by Jason Furman, who is now an economic adviser to Mr. Obama, the average worker retiring in 2075 would receive benefits 28 percent lower, not half what they would receive under the current plan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SCORECARD The Obama campaign has taken Mr. McCain to task for peddling false information in his advertising, but the fact-checks on this spot have revealed that the Obama campaign is, in this case, guilty of the same offense. Yet this spot is consistent with Mr. Obama's attempt to link Mr. McCain to Mr. Bush whenever possible, and the tactic could be effective among voters who remain disillusioned with the last seven years. </span></p>
