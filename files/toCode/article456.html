  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This 30-second advertisement for Senator Barack Obama was introduced Friday and is to run on national cable networks and on television stations in some swing states. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PRODUCER The Obama Media Team </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE SCRIPT An announcer says: ''1982. John McCain goes to Washington. Things have changed in the last 26 years, but McCain hasn't. He admits he still doesn't know how to use a computer, can't send an e-mail. Still doesn't understand the economy. And favors 200 billion in new tax cuts for corporations, but almost nothing for the middle class. After one president who was out of touch, we just can't afford more of the same.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ON SCREEN The commercial opens with an image of a disco ball and 1982 flashes on the screen. A younger Mr. McCain, a new congressman, is shown at a hearing. His hair, longer than it is today, is rumpled and his large glasses offer a retro look. An old cellphone, a record player, an early-model computer and a Rubik's Cube flash on the screen. Fast-forward to present day, a Macintosh computer is shown. A video clip shows Mr. McCain stepping from a golf cart with former President George Bush, with the words ''Doesn't understand the economy.'' Champagne flutes clink and a family shopping at a supermarket appears as the message turns to tax cuts. The advertisement closes with Mr. McCain grinning as he stands by the current President Bush.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ACCURACY Mr. McCain has told reporters that he does not regularly use a computer and was trying to learn how to send e-mail messages. A quotation from last year about Mr. McCain not understanding the economy can be misleading because it omits statements he has since made. The tax argument accurately states that Mr. McCain favors reducing the corporate income tax rate. The bulk of his tax-cutting proposals would benefit those with higher incomes, while Mr. Obama says he wants much larger tax breaks for low- and middle-income Americans. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SCORECARD The overriding message of this advertisement is that Mr. McCain -- who is 72, though the commercial never mentions that -- is out of touch and out of date. The Obama campaign says the intention is to show how long Mr. McCain has served in Washington, but it also suggests that he may not be equipped to handle today's fast-moving problems. By linking him to two Bush presidents, the advertisement tries to deflate the message that McCain would be a candidate of change. But will Mr. Obama attract older voters with this message?
