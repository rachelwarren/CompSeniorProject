  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Titled ''Advice,'' this is a 30-second advertisement for Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee. It is running online, but the McCain campaign said it would begin running on television nationally on Monday. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PRODUCER McCain media team </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE SCRIPT A narrator says: ''Obama has no background in economics. Who advises him? The Post says it's Franklin Raines, for 'advice on mortgage and housing policy.' Shocking. Under Raines, Fannie Mae committed 'extensive financial fraud.' Raines made millions. Fannie Mae collapsed. Taxpayers? Stuck with the bill. Barack Obama. Bad advice, bad instincts. Not ready to lead.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ON THE SCREEN The advertisement begins with a picture of Mr. Obama, with his head cocked and a perplexed expression, as the words ''No economic background'' appear next to him. Next is a similar shot of Mr. Obama, this time next to a quote from The Washington Post reading, ''Advice on Mortgage and Housing Policy.'' The advertisement goes on to show a darkened background with several pictures of Mr. Raines, side-by-side with pictures of Mr. Obama, over the words ''As Much as $25 Million,'' again attributed to The Post. Then an elderly woman appears on screen, next to the words, ''Taxpayers stuck with bill.'' The spot concludes with an image of a smiling Mr. Obama. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ACCURACY This advertisement forced a series of heated attacks between the McCain and Obama campaigns beginning on Thursday, a debate that was left unresolved by the end of Friday. What is clear is that the McCain campaign has left the strong impression that Mr. Raines, a former chief executive of Fannie Mae who was ousted in 2004 amid an investigation over its accounting practices, is a close adviser to Mr. Obama, a suggestion that is totally unsupported by the facts. But the advertisement's basic assertion is not a whole-cloth fabrication. The Post reported on July 16, in a Style-section article on Mr. Raines, that he had ''taken calls from Barack Obama's presidential campaign seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters.'' Others immediately repeated the information, including Politico.com. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Until the advertisement came out on Thursday evening, the Obama campaign did not question the claim. Since then, it has vigorously denied a relationship between Mr. Obama and Mr. Raines, with Bill Burton, a spokesman for Mr. Obama, calling the advertisement ''another flat-out lie from a dishonorable campaign that is increasingly incapable of telling the truth,'' and demanding a correction of the original article from The Post. The campaign also sent by e-mail a statement from Mr. Raines, saying: ''I am not an advisor to Barack Obama, nor have I provided his campaign with advice on housing or economic matters.'' On Friday, Mr. Burton said that Mr. Raines and Mr. Obama met once on the campaign trail, sometime in 2007 or 2008, and had not talked since then. He said Mr. Raines conducted an ''introductory meeting'' with a Senate aide to Mr. Obama, also sometime in the last two years. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SCORECARD The McCain campaign's goal was to link Mr. Obama to Fannie Mae; its disintegration contributed to the worst economic upheaval in decades. It is meant to play into voters' fears, as well as anger, as both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama jockey to prove their superior ability to lead the nation through the crisis. Most viewers will not know that Mr. Raines has not been a major adviser to Mr. Obama, making it possible that the taint of Fannie Mae will stick. Yet there are so many ominous-sounding political commercials circulating that this one could be lost in the hubbub. JULIE BOSMAN </span></p>
