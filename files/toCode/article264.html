  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WASHINGTON -- Republican John McCain on Wednesday touted his plan to have government buy up bad mortgages, while Democrat Barack Obama said his rival's approach would hurt taxpayers and help bad lenders. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A day after the second presidential debate was dominated by exchanges on the sagging economy, McCain told supporters in Pennsylvania his $300 billion plan would help struggling homeowners obtain &quot;manageable mortgages.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His plan would direct the Treasury secretary to buy the mortgages directly and use funds from the $700 billion financial bailout approved by Congress last week. The bailout package currently calls for the government to buy mortgage-backed securities and allow -- but not require -- direct purchases of mortgages.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We must go to the heart of the problem, and right now that problem is a housing crisis,&quot; McCain said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama has said he wants the government to consider such a move, but he has not called for a mandate. His campaign said a key difference between McCain's proposal and the new government bailout program is that lenders would absorb losses that would otherwise go to taxpayers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The biggest beneficiaries of this (McCain) plan will be the same financial institutions that got us into this mess,&quot; Obama economic policy director Jason Furman said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain policy adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin said the Republican wants direct action so homeowners get relief quicker. He said the McCain plan could affect as many as 10 million mortgage holders.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Indiana, Obama again sought to link McCain to President Bush. &quot;It is time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put Wall Street before Main Street.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The campaigns also followed up the debate with new television advertisements. Obama's spot criticizes McCain's plan for health care tax credits, saying it would lead to taxes on employer-based benefits.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's&nbsp;ad, meanwhile, questions Obama's qualifications, calling him the &quot;most liberal&quot; member of the U.S. Senate and saying he is &quot;not presidential.&quot; <br /></span></p>
