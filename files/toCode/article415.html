  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WASHINGTON -- Barack Obama outlined rules for a &quot;21st-century regulatory system&quot; Tuesday, and John McCain proposed a commission to examine the causes of failed banks and over-speculation in the financial markets. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a week in which investment bank Lehman Bros. declared bankruptcy, brokerage firm Merrill Lynch was merged into Bank of America and insurance giant American International Group was bailed out by a federal loan, the presidential candidates refocused their campaigns on the economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They also released new ads: Obama hammered McCain for saying Monday that the fundamentals of the economy remain strong, and McCain promised &quot;new rules for fairness and honesty&quot; for failing institutions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain and Obama tried to reassure voters worried about record home foreclosures and government assistance for Wall Street.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Presidents &quot;don't set interest rates and can't stop people from making bad investment decisions,&quot; said non-partisan financial analyst Stan Collender of Qorvis Communications. But there are ways they can influence markets, from &quot;jawboning to appointing the Treasury secretary to proposing legislation.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Collender said presidents must rely on &quot;the power to persuade&quot; and ease voters' fears about their savings and investments. &quot;Ultimately, any economy is built on confidence,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain vowed at an Ohio rally to crack down on &quot;the kind of wild speculation that can put our markets at risk.&quot; Appearing earlier on NBC, he proposed a special panel &quot;to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This foundation of our economy, the American worker, is strong, but it has been put at risk by the greed and mismanagement of Wall Street and Washington,&quot; McCain said later in Florida.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama told a Colorado audience that McCain punted by proposing a commission to study the problem. &quot;This isn't 9/11,&quot; he said, referring to the bipartisan panel that reviewed the 2001 terrorist attacks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain &quot;has spent decades in Washington supporting financial institutions instead of their customers,&quot; Obama said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He proposed tougher oversight on lenders that receive federal funds and the identification of &quot;systemic risks.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said McCain's comment about strong economic fundamentals was a &quot;huge mistake.&quot; Some voters &quot;are going to wonder, 'What planet are you on?'&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">GOP pollster Ed Goeas, who works for McCain, said McCain has long campaigned against corporate malfeasance. &quot;You're going to see him make the case that those people should be held accountable,&quot; he said.</span></p>
