  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He was the world's biggest celebrity, but his star's fading. So they lashed out at Sarah Palin. Dismissed her as &quot;good-looking.&quot; That backfired, so they said she was doing &quot;what she was told.&quot; Then desperately called Sarah Palin a liar. How disrespectful. And how Governor Sarah Palin proves them wrong, every day. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ANALYSIS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This John McCain&nbsp;commercial, which contains two significant distortions, is part of a larger effort to rule criticism of his running mate out of bounds and to paint her as the victim of unfair attacks from both Democrats and the media.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The &quot;they&quot; is never specified here, but the notion that Barack Obama's campaign &quot;dismissed&quot; Sarah Palin based on her looks twists what was clearly a self-deprecating joke by his running mate, Joseph R. Biden Jr. The senator from Delaware laughed as he compared himself to the Alaska governor: &quot;Well, there's obvious differences. She's good-looking.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The &quot;doing what she was told&quot; line is an exaggerated version of a comment by Obama strategist David Axelrod. &quot;She tried to attack Obama by saying he had no significant legislative accomplishments -- maybe that's what she was told,&quot; he said. Axelrod did not say that Palin was entirely programmed by the McCain campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The spot is accurate in saying the Obama campaign called Palin a liar. An Obama&nbsp;ad challenged her for taking credit for stopping Alaska's so-called Bridge to Nowhere, which she had originally supported, saying: &quot;Politicians lying about their records?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The indignation in the female narrator's voice suggests that the Obama camp is unfairly pillorying Palin, in no small measure because she is a woman. One irony is that, while earlier McCain ads depicted the senator from Illinois as &quot;the world's biggest celebrity&quot; -- trying to make a liability of the large and enthusiastic crowds Obama was drawing -- McCain now has a celebrity of his own on the ticket and is determined to protect her image.</span></p>
