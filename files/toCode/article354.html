  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If you watch the presidential debates over the next few weeks, you won't see Libertarian Party nominee Bob Barr and independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader share the stage with John McCain and Barack Obama. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's not because Barr and Nader don't want to be there; their comments below show they'd like nothing better. But the Commission on Presidential Debates has standards for deciding whom to include, chiefly that a candidate has to average at least 15% in five national polls before the election. Nader and Barr didn't come close, so they're out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That's as it should be.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With barely five weeks left before Election Day, voters should get as much time as they can to scrutinize the two candidates who have a chance to win. The debates offer the best opportunity Americans will get to see the nominees under pressure on their own, with no advisers, no surrogates, no script and no lifeline call. There should be no distractions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For all their skill and passion, neither Barr nor Nader has attracted much of a following, and neither appears to have even a remote chance of doing much more than shaving fractions off the major party candidates' totals. In national polls, McCain and Obama routinely score in the high 40s. In CNN/Opinion Research Corp. polls taken from July to last weekend, Nader, in his fifth campaign for the presidency, has never broken 6% and most recently scored 4%. Barr's high was 3% in July; last weekend, he polled just 1%.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both Barr and Nader argue that the commission's 15% threshold is a Catch-22 because third-party candidates can't get above that number unless they're in debates or have millions to spend. Barr cites the case of Ross Perot, who polled 7%-14% just before the 1992 debates but drew 19% of the vote after viewers saw him go head-to-head with Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In fact, though, Perot got into the debates in part because he had been a much more formidable candidate earlier that year, at one point hitting 38% in national polls and topping both Bush and Clinton. Perot lost much of his support by dropping out of the race and then dropping back in shortly before the debates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's true that third-party candidates can bring energy and new ideas to a race, as Perot did when he forced Clinton and Bush to make the federal budget deficit a top-tier issue in the 1992 campaign. But they also have to demonstrate that they've earned their way into the final rounds by building a following with the power of their ideas and the example of their leadership.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barr, a former congressman who earned a high profile when he helped lead impeachment proceedings against Clinton, has not moved many voters with his libertarian views. Nader has tried and failed to build a serious following since 1992.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With the stakes as high as they are in this election, the presidential debates are no place for the gadflies. <br /></span></p>
