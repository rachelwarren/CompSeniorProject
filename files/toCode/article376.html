  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It was not that long ago that black people in the Deep South could be beaten or killed for seeking the right to vote, talking back to the wrong white man or failing to give way on the sidewalk. People of color who violated these and other proscriptions could be designated ''uppity niggers'' and subjected to acts of violence and intimidation that were meant to dissuade others from following their examples.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The term ''uppity'' was applied to affluent black people, who sometimes paid a horrific price for owning nicer homes, cars or more successful businesses than whites. Race-based wealth envy was a common trigger for burnings, lynchings and cataclysmic episodes of violence like the Tulsa race riot of 1921, in which a white mob nearly eradicated the prosperous black community of Greenwood. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Forms of eloquence and assertiveness that were viewed as laudable among whites were seen as positively mutinous when practiced by people of color. As such, black men and women who looked white people squarely in the eye -- and argued with them about things that mattered -- were declared a threat to the racial order and persecuted whenever possible.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This obsession with black subservience was based in nostalgia for slavery. No sane person would openly express such a sentiment today. But the discomfort with certain forms of black assertiveness is too deeply rooted in the national psyche -- and the national language -- to just disappear. It has been a persistent theme in the public discourse since Barack Obama became a plausible candidate for the presidency.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A blatant example surfaced earlier this month, when a Georgia Republican, Representative Lynn Westmoreland, described the Obamas as ''uppity'' in response to a reporter's question. Mr. Westmoreland, who actually stood by the term when given a chance to retreat, later tried to excuse himself by saying that the dictionary definition carried no racial meaning. That seems implausible. Mr. Westmoreland is from the South, where the vernacular meaning of the word has always been clear.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Jim Crow South institutionalized racial paternalism in its newspapers, which typically denied black adults the courtesy titles of Mr. and Mrs. -- and reduced them to children by calling them by first names only. Representative Geoff Davis, Republican of Kentucky, succumbed to the old language earlier this year when describing what he viewed as Mr. Obama's lack of preparedness to handle nuclear policy. ''That boy's finger does not need to be on the button,'' he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the Old South, black men and women who were competent, confident speakers on matters of importance were termed ''disrespectful,'' the implication being that all good Negroes bowed, scraped, grinned and deferred to their white betters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In what is probably a harbinger of things to come, the McCain campaign has already run a commercial that carries a similar intimation, accusing Mr. Obama of being ''disrespectful'' to Sarah Palin. The argument is muted, but its racial antecedents are very clear.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The throwback references that have surfaced in the campaign suggest that Republicans are fighting on racial grounds, even when express references to race are not evident. In a replay of elections past, the G.O.P. will try to leverage racial ghosts and fears without getting its hands visibly dirty. The Democrats try to parry in customary ways.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama seems to understand that he is always an utterance away from a statement -- or a phrase -- that could transform him in a campaign ad from the affable, rational and racially ambiguous candidate into the archetypical angry black man who scares off the white vote. His caution is evident from the way he sifts and searches the language as he speaks, stepping around words that might push him into the danger zone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">These maneuvers are often painful to watch. The troubling part is that they are necessary.</span></p>
