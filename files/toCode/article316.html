  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With every day seeming to bring a new bank failure, a jittery political donor might very well ask: Where does my campaign keep its millions of dollars in contributions and are they safe? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Queries to the Obama and McCain campaigns, as well as the Democratic and Republican National Committees, yielded differing answers and levels of specificity. All emphasized there was no cause for concern.</span></p>
