  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain: I will not take the low road to the highest office in this land.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Narrator: What's happened to John McCain? He's running the sleaziest ads ever. Truly vile. Dishonest smears that he repeats even after it's been exposed as a lie. The truth be damned. A disgraceful, dishonorable campaign. After voting with Bush 90 percent of the time, proposing the same disastrous economic policies. It seems deception is all he has left. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ANALYSIS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This Barack Obama&nbsp;commercial relies almost entirely on harsh media criticism of John McCain's ads, and most of the citations are from liberal sources, such as Time columnist Joe Klein, Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne, Washington Monthly blogger Steve Benen and the New Republic. This is a classic technique of using third-party citations to validate a candidate's argument. And while a casual viewer might get the impression that Time and The Post are running news stories calling McCain's ads sleazy and disgraceful, the columnists' last names are shown in small type.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Recent media accounts have said that McCain is using more frequent and serious falsehoods than the Illinois senator, but fact-check efforts have found occasional distortions in Obama ads, as well.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This is the second spot in less than a week in which Obama has gone aggressively negative against McCain. A previous ad said McCain is out of touch and can't even use a computer, despite the fact that his old war injuries make it difficult for him to type for any length of time.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This commercial attempts to use the criticism of McCain's advertising to raise questions about his policy proposals. It is true that the Arizona senator has voted with President Bush 90 percent of the time and supports some of the same economic policies, such as extending the president's tax cuts. But McCain has differed on some Bush policies, such as supporting greater financial regulation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Whether this kind of attack will move votes is open to question, since voters have grown accustomed to candidates accusing each other of making false claims.</span></p>
