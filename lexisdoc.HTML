<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RACINE, Wis. -- To Mi tt Romney, the 10 electoral votes in Wisconsin may be more essential than extra, a critical backup plan if a first-tier battleground state falls out of reach.&lt;P A&gt;Seven weeks until the election, with Mr. Romney facing new questions about his ability to gain trust among voters experiencing economic hardships, his campaig n is increasingly pointing to Wisconsin as a place where a statewide Republican resurgence could rub off on Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But President Obama has overtaken Mr. Romney on who would do a better job handling the economy, accordi ng to a new Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll of likely Wiscons in voters. The poll also found that Mr. Obama has a 17-point edge over Mr. Romne y when voters are asked if a candidate cares about their needs and problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the president makes his first campaign visit of the year to Wisconsin on Sa turday, the poll found that Mr. Obama was the choice of 51 percent to 45 percent for Mr. Romney among likely voters. The six-point lead, which includes those wh o said they were leaning in one direction or another, marks a slight shift in Mr . Obama's direction since Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin joined the Re publican ticket last month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings of the poll, along with the fallo ut from newly exposed remarks Mr. Romney made at a fund-raiser in which he blunt ly suggested that 47 percent of Americans saw themselves as victims who are depe ndent on the government, offer a window into the challenges confronting his camp aign here and other important swing states during the final 48 days of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob Jankowski, an independent voter who supported Mr. Obama four years ago but has been disappointed by his economic leadership and disapproves of his hea lth care plan, is among the 3 percent of voters in the survey who say they are s till undecided. He said he did not feel loyalty to Mr. Obama simply because he s upported him last time, but he said Mr. Romney had not made his case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Oba ma is putting out his plans and his details and being more public on that, but w ith Romney it's kind of gray,'' said Mr. Jankowski, 39, speaking in a follow-up interview Tuesday afternoon here in Jefferson Park, as a cool breeze rustled the tree leaves. ''I'd like to know more -- educate me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times, in collaboration with Quinnipiac and CBS News, is tracking the presidential race with recurring polls in six states. The latest collection of surveys also inclu ded Colorado, where Mr. Romney is running nearly even with Mr. Obama, and Virgin ia, where Mr. Obama has a narrow advantage of four percentage points, both of wh ich are inside the survey's margin of sampling error of plus or minus three perc entage points for each candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Mr. Romney, Wisconsin offers one of the best chances to fight on Mr. Obama's terrain in the Midwest and expand th e battleground map. The Romney campaign has redirected some of its money and man power once intended for Michigan and Pennsylvania to Wisconsin, hoping to create as many paths as possible to reaching the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The importance of Wisconsin was amplified this week when the l eading ''super PAC'' supporting Mr. Romney, Restore Our Future, bought $820,000 in television advertising for the final stretch of the race. The Romney campaign and the Republican National Committee also have stepped up their investments in the state, underscoring the urgency for Mr. Romney to try and change the landsc ape of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the poll found that Republicans have formidable challe nges in Wisconsin, with Mr. Obama expanding his lead among women and remaining f ar more competitive among men than in many battleground states. The poll found t hat 55 percent of women support Mr. Obama and 41 percent prefer Mr. Romney, but among men there is only a two percentage point difference between the candidates .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think Obama has done a much better job than anyone realizes,'' said Laurie Bookstein, 62, an independent voter in Milwaukee, speaking in a follow-up interview. ''I think Obama's honesty and integrity in creating a better economy is important to the country as a whole.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The degree to which Wisconsin wi ll develop as a top-tier battleground state depends on how the opening waves of advertising by candidates and outside groups settle in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airwaves here w ere relatively quiet until last week. Wisconsin has become more appealing to Mr. Romney out of necessity, aides said, with his campaign worried about its trajec tory in Ohio and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A victory in Iowa and Wisconsin, for example, wo uld mean 16 electoral votes, more than the 13 of Virginia. If Mr. Romney prevail ed in New Hampshire, that would give him 20 electoral votes, surpassing Ohio's 1 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Romney campaign is strengthened here by one of the most tested party operations in the country, which earlier this summer helped Gov. Scott Walker f ight off a recall challenge. The governor's job approval rating is now 52 percen t, the poll found. Republicans say their gains in 2010, along with Mr. Walker's victory in June, have wiped away Mr. Obama's 14-point advantage from 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's overall approval rating in Wisconsin stands at 51 percent, and h e holds an advantage over Mr. Romney across all significant sets of issues, from handling health care, taxes, Medicare and the ability to handle an internationa l crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll found that Mr. Romney is backed by more independents tha n Mr. Obama, and a majority of those who are more enthusiastic about voting this year. But Mr. Romney, who has struggled to build a personal connection and an e mpathetic appeal, is viewed by 55 percent of likely voters here as a candidate w hose policies favor the rich compared with 10 percent for the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state polls were conducted by telephone, both landlines and cellphones, fro m Sept. 11 to 17 among 1,485 likely voters in Wisconsin, 1,497 likely voters in Colorado and 1,474 likely voters in Virginia. The findings are largely similar a cross the states, particularly Mr. Romney's fading advantage on being the candid ate best equipped to turn around the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I am voting against Obama b ecause four years ago he made these promises as to what he would do to improve t he economy,'' said Arnold Gesch, 83, a retired real estate broker and independen t voter from Sheboygan, speaking in a follow-up interview. ''I just have no fait h in him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains an open question how voters will react to the challe nges facing Mr. Romney, including his forceful defense of a secretly recorded vi deo of him at a fund-raiser in May. But a sense of agitation was detected in som e follow-up interviews Tuesday at his suggestion about people being dependent on government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm not a bottom-feeder like they try to make us out to be,' ' said Eddie Gochenour, 66, a retired engineer from Danville, Va., who said he h ad been a Republican for 44 years but intended to support Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I ea rned what I'm getting, and worked all my life for my benefits. I have a good nes t egg, but I also earned what I'm getting from the government.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Followi ng is the transcript of a video recorded during a private fund-raiser for Mitt R omney last May, published by Mother Jones magazine and transcribed by The New Yo rk Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MITT ROMNEY: The president's foreign policy, in my opinion, is form ed in part by a perception he has that his magnetism and his charm and his persu asiveness is so compelling, that he can sit down with people like Putin and Chav ez and Ahmadinejad and they'll find that we're such wonderful people that they'l l go on with us. And they'll stop doing bad things. It's an extraordinarily na&iuml;v e perception and it led to huge errors in North Korea, in Iraq, obviously in Ira n, in Egypt, around the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My own view is that the centerpi ece of American foreign policy has to be strength. Everything I do will be calcu lated to increasing America's strength. When you stand by your allies, you incre ase your strength. When you attack your allies, you become weaker. When you stan d by your principles, you get stronger. When you have a big military that's bigg er than anyone else's, you're stronger. When you have a strong economy, you buil d American strength. For me, everything is about strength and communicating to p eople what is and is not acceptable. It's speaking softly but carrying a very, v ery, very big stick. And this president, instead, speaks loudly and carries a ti ny stick. And that's not the right course for foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I saw Dr. Kis singer in New York ...[Aside] You're not eating!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: I'm mesmeriz ed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: Yeah ... don't spoil [unintelligible].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I saw Dr. Kissi nger. I said to him, ''How are we perceived around the world?'' And he said, one word: ''Weak.'' We are weak. And that's how this president is perceived, by our friends and unfortunately by our foes. And it's no wonder that people like Kim Jong-un, the new leader of North Korea, announces a long-range missile test only a week after he said he wouldn't. Because it's like, what's this president goin g to do about it? You know, if you can't act, don't threaten. Please?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: Just to follow up on Iraq ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: I just want to show you how it's done, you take this in your fork [unintelligible].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: [ unintelligible] ... the hostages, on his inauguration. ... My question is really , how can you sort of duplicate that scenario?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: I should ask you , how do I duplicate that scenario?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: I think it had to do with the fact that the Iranians perceive that Reagan would do something to really ge t them out. In other words, he would have the strength, and that's why I'm follo wing on your thing about strength. That's why I'm suggesting that something that you say over the next few months gets the Iranians to understand that their pur suit of a bomb is something that you would [unintelligible]. And I think that's something that could possibly resonate very well with the American public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: I appreciate the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the things that's frustrating to me is that, on a typical day like this, where I do three or four events like thi s, the number of foreign policy questions I get are between zero and one. And th e American people are not concentrated at all upon China, on Russia, Iran, Iraq. This president's failure to put in place a status of forces agreement allowing ten to twenty thousand troops to stay in Iraq: unthinkable! And yet, in that ele ction, in the Jimmy Carter election, the fact that we had hostages in Iran, I me an, that was all we talked about. And we had the two helicopters crash in the de sert, I mean, that was the focus and so him solving that made all the difference in the world. I'm afraid today if you simply got Iran to agree to stand down, t hey'd go, ''Hold on.'' If something of that nature presents itself, I will work to find a way to take advantage of the opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: Tonight's your lucky night; more foreign policy. With the first time you were in Jerusale m, we appreciate you being there. How do you think that the Palestinian problem can be solved, and what are you going to do about it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: I'm torn by two perspectives in this regard. One is the one which I've had for some time, which is that the Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peac e, and that the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish. Now why do I say that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some might say, well, just let the Palestinians have the West Bank and have security, and set up a separate nation for the Palestinians. And t hen come a couple of thorny questions. I don't have a map here to look up geogra phy, but the border between Israel and the West Bank is obviously right there, r ight next to Tel Aviv, which is the financial capital, the industrial capital of Israel, the center of Israel. It's, what, the border would be seven miles from Tel Aviv to what would be the West Bank. Nine miles. The challenge is, the other side of the West Bank, the other side of what would be this new Palestinian sta te would either be Syria at one point or Jordan. And of course, the Iranians wou ld want to do through the West Bank exactly what they did through Lebanon, and w hat they did into Gaza. Which is the Iranians would want to bring missiles, that armament, into the West Bank and potentially threaten Israel. So Israel, of cou rse, would have to say, ''That can't happen. We've got to keep Iranians from bri nging weaponry into the West Bank.'' Well, that means that, who, the Israelis ar e going to patrol the border between Jordan, Syria and this new Palestinian nati on? Well, the Palestinians would say, ''No way. We're an independent country. Yo u can't guard our border with other Arab nations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then how about the airport. How about flying into this Palestinian nation? Are we going to allow m ilitary aircraft to come in? And weaponry to come in? And if not, who's going to keep it from coming in? Well, the Israelis. Well, the Palestinians are going to say, ''We're not an independent nation if Israel is able to come in and tell us what to land at our airport.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These problems -- they're very hard to solv e. And I look at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political purposes. Committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel. And these tho rny issues. And I say, there's just no way. So what you do is you move things al ong the best way you can, you hope for some degree of stability. But you recogni ze this is going to remain an unsolved problem. We live with that in China and T aiwan. We have a potentially volatile situation, but we sort of live with it. An d we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately somehow, something wi ll happen and resolve it. We don't go to war to try and resolve it imminently.&lt;P A&gt; On the other hand, I got a call from a former secretary of state -- and I wo n't mention which one it was -- but this individual said to me, ''You know, I th ink there's a prospect for a settlement between the Palestinians and the Israeli s after the Palestinian elections.'' I said, ''Really?'' And, you know, his answ er was yes. I think there's some prospect. And I didn't delve into it, but you k now, I always keep open the idea. But I have to tell you, the idea of pushing on the Israelis to give something up to get the Palestinians to act is the worst i dea in the world. We have done that time and time and time again. It does not wo rk. So the only answer is show strength, again. American strength, American reso lve, and if the Palestinians someday reach a point where they want peace more th an we're trying to force peace on them, then it's worth having the discussion. B ut until then it's just wishful thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: Individuals in this room obviously are your supporters. I am very concerned about the average Ameri can who doesn't know you. There is a terrible misconception and I spend numerous hours trying [unintelligible] to be your defender when you are such a deserving individual. You were saying years ago that ''I called George Bush Sr., and he h ad helped me in my campaign in Massachusetts when I ran for Senate. I told him t hat there was a guy named Clinton who was [unintelligible] for the following rea sons, and he laughed.'' Right now, I'm very concerned. Women do not want to vote for you. Hispanics, the majority of them do not want to vote for you. College s tudents don't. After talking to them and explaining and rationalizing on a one-o n-one basis, we are able to change their opinions, but at a mass level, what do you want us to do, this group here, as your emissaries, going out to convert the se individuals to someone who's obviously going to be such an incredible asset t o this country. We want you. What do we do? Just tell us how we can help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M R. ROMNEY: I have some good news for you. It's not impossible. And the reason I say that is because, for instance, The New York Times had a poll last week, The New York Times and NBC, and I was leading by two points among women. Now the pre sident came out and said: ''This is an outrageous poll. They don't know what the y're doing.'' But, by the way, the polls at this stage make no difference at all . The point is, women are open to supporting me; they like the president persona lly, but they're disappointed. They're disappointed with the jobs that they're s eeing for their kids. They're disappointed with their own economic standing righ t now. So we can capture women's votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're having a much harder time wit h Hispanic voters. And if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the D emocrats as the African-American voting bloc has in the past, well, we're in tro uble as a party and, I think, as a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: Rubio!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Crowd rumblings, unintelligible, and laughter]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: We have some great Hi spanic leaders in our party that will help communicate what our party stands for , and frankly, what I need you to do is raise millions of dollars because the pr esident is going to have eight hundred, nine hundred million dollars. That's by far the most important thing you can do, because you don't have the capacity to speak to hundreds of thousands of people. I will be in those debates. There will be, I don't know, a hundred and fifty million Americans watching. If I do well, it'll help. If I don't, it won't help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: You will do so well. Your debates are incredible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Applause]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: Thank you. But a dvertising makes a difference. The president will engage in a personal, characte r assassination campaign, and so we'll have to fire back, one in defense and, nu mber two, in offense. And that'll take money. By the way, you'll see the ads her e. Florida will be one of those states that is the key state, and so all of the money will get spent in 10 states and this is one of them. So the best thing I c an ask you to do is, yeah, sure, talk to people and tell them that you know me a nd word of mouth makes a big difference, but you know, I'm not terribly well kno wn by the American public because ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: You're known as a rich boy. They say he's a rich man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: Don't worry. Given all those neg ative things, the fact that I'm either tied or close to the president, and the f act that he's out there talking about the one-year anniversary of Osama bin Lade n being captured, unemployment coming down, unleashing his campaign, we're still sort of tied? That's very interesting. Please.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: I would disag ree with that. I think a lot of young children coming out of college feel they w ere let down by the president. They feel that there's not a job out there for th em, and they thought they were going to make sixty thousand and now they're maki ng thirty thousand. Very similar to the U6. My question to you is, why don't you stick up for yourself? To me, you should be so proud that you're wealthy. That' s what we all aspire to, we kill ourselves. We don't work 9-to-5. We're way ... [unintelligible] five days a week. I raise four girls five days a week. Why not stick up for yourself and say why is it bad to aspire to be wealthy and successf ul? Why is it bad to kill yourself and why is it bad to cut thirty jobs at the d eath of three hundred? When there's people cutting jobs ... you saved companies that were failing. So my question is, when does that [unintelligible] ... worked his way up to nothing to his present success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: You heard in my speech tonight ... oh, you weren't here. In every stump speech I give, I speak a bout the fact that people who bring and achieve enormous success do not make us poorer, they make us better off. And the Republican audience that I typically sp eak to applauds. I said that tonight, and the media is there and they write abou t it, they say that Mr. Romney defends success and America and dreamers and so f orth. So they write about it. But in terms of what gets through to the American consciousness, I have heard a [unintelligible] lid full of that, as to what they write about. We will have three debates, we'll have a chance to talk about that at the debates, there will be ads which attack me, I will fire back, in a way t hat describes the best way we can ... I mean the theme of my speech is ... I win d up talking about how the thing which I find most disappointing in this preside nt is his attack of one America against another America, the division of America based on going after those who have been successful. And then I quote Marco Rub io in my speeches, I say Marco Rubio ... I don't think I said that at the fund-r aising event earlier today, but I did when I was ... I just said, Senator Rubio says that when he grew up here, poor, that they looked at people who had a lot o f wealth and his parents never once said, we need some of what they have, they s hould give us something. Instead they said, if we work hard and go to school, so meday we might be able to have the same thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Applause]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will cont inue to do that. How much of that gets picked up ... there's so many things that don't get picked up in a campaign because people aren't watching and, by the wa y, most people don't watch during the summer. I say we're going to go into a sea son here, starting in mid-June, where almost no one pays attention. Then, after Labor Day, in September and October, that's when it'll get [unintelligible]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: Over the past three years, all everybody's been told is, don't w orry, we'll take care of it. How are you going to do it, with two months before the election, to convince everybody you've got to take care of yourself?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR . ROMNEY: Well, there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the preside nt no matter what. There are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement and govern ment should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter wha t. I mean, the president starts off with 48, 49 ... I mean, he starts off with a huge number. These are people who pay no income tax; 47 percent of Americans pa y no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn't connect. He'll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich. I mean, that's what they sell every four y ears. And so my job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives. What I have to do is convince the 5 to 10 percent in the center, that are independents, that are thoughtful, that look at voting one way or the other depending upon, in som e cases, emotion, whether they like the guy or not, what he looks like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wh en you ask those people ... I find it amazing. We do all these polls and poll al l these people to see where we stand in the polls. But 45 percent of the people will vote for the Republican, and 48 or 49 ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[There is missing video foot age between the two clips.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... about twice as much as China. Not 10 times as much, like this reporter said. And we have responsibility for the whole worl d. They're only focused on one little area of the world -- the South China Sea, the East China Sea. That's it. And they're building the military at a rapid rate . This idea that we've always spent so much money on the military. ... It's like , ''Guys, don't overthink how strong we are.'' We have said, you probably know, this was a couple of years ago, but we had one of our aircraft carriers standing by Japan, and the Chinese pulled up behind us in a diesel sub, a super quiet di esel sub, pulled up behind us. We could have been torpedoed. We're not that kind of ... our Navy is smaller in number of ships in any time since 1917. And this president wants to shrink it. The list goes on. Our Air Force is older and small er than any time since '47, when the Air Force was formed. And he wants to shrin k it. If we go the way of Europe, which is spending 1 to 2 percent of its econom y on the military, we will not be able to have freedom in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: When the electorate tunes in in September, the markets are going to be l ooking at marginal tax rates going up and another debt ceiling fight ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR . ROMNEY: Yeah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: ... but sequestration under the debt ceiling deal ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: What do they call it, tax again? Isn't that what they call it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Laughter] CROWD MEMBER: Now, the Obamacare praxis on dividends an d capital gains, I mean ... in the markets, you are going to be speaking very li vely in October on all of those issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: They'll probably be loo king at what the polls are saying. If it looks like I am going to win, the marke ts will be happy. If it looks like the president is going to win, the markets wi ll not be terribly happy. It depends on, of course, which markets you are talkin g about and which types of commodities and so forth. But my own view is that if we win on Nov. 6, there will be a great deal of optimism about the future of thi s country. We'll see capital come back, and we'll see, without actually doing an ything, we'll actually get a boost to the economy. Um, if the president gets re- elected, I don't know what'll happen. I can never predict what the markets will do. Sometimes it does the exact opposite of what I would have expected. But my o wn view is that if we get the ''tax again,'' as they call it, Jan. 1st with this president and with a Congress that can't work together ... it really is frighte ning. It's really frightening in my view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: Fifty-four percent of American voters think China's economy is bigger than the U.S. When I first me t you four or five years ago, you did a data call where you went very granular a nd you said, ''Look guys,'' this is a small group, he says, ''This is it. This i s what it is.'' Tell us like it is. How are you going to win if 54 percent of th e voters think China's economy is bigger than ours? Or if it costs 4 cents to ma ke a penny and we keep making pennies? Canada got it right a month ago. Why isn' t someone saying, ''Stop making pennies, round it to the nearest nickel?'' That' s an easy thing, you know, compared to Iran. I want to see you take the gloves o ff and talk to the people that read the paper and read the book and care about k nowing the facts and knowledge is power, as opposed to people that are swayed by what sounds good at the moment. You know, if you turned it into, like, ''Eat wh at you kill,'' it'd be a landslide, in my humble opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: [Laug hs] Well, I wrote a book that lays out my view for what has to happen in the cou ntry. And people who are fascinated by policy will read the book. We have a Web site that lays out white papers and a whole series of issues that I care about. I have to tell you, I don't think this will have a significant impact on my elec tability. I wish it did. I think our ads will have a much bigger impact. I think the debates will have a big impact. Um ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: [Most of comment unintelligible] ... Peterson ... in trouble 20 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: But t hat's my point. Which is, being right, my dad used to say, ''Being right early i s not good in politics.'' And, in a setting like this, a highly intellectual sub ject or a discussion of a whole series of important topics typically doesn't win elections. And there are, there are ... I mean, for instance, this president wo n because of hope and change. All right? He won because of hope and change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: Keep the change!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: Yeah, well ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Laughter]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: So, I can tell you that I have a very good team of extraordina rily experienced, highly successful consultants, a couple of people in particula r who've done races around the world. I didn't realize these guys in the U.S., t he Karl Rove equivalents, they do races all over the world -- in Armenia and Afr ica and Israel. I mean, they work for Bibi Netanyahu in his race. So they do the se races and they see which ads work and which processes work best. And we have ideas about what we do over the course of the campaign. I'd tell 'em to you, but I'd have to, you know, shoot you. Hopefully, we'll be successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Laughte r]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: I think one of the aspects about the changes that worked well for Obama four years ago was he promised to bring us more honest, transpare nt government to Washington. I've been around politics for this campaign. I work ed even with Barry Goldwater in 1964, so I've got the oldest Republican [unintel ligible] ... but from what I see, particularly in the last seven months in my ow n personal involvement in the issue, is the government in Washington right now i s permeated by cronyism, outright corruption. ... Our regulatory agencies that a re supposed to protect the public are protecting the people that they're suppose d to be regulating. And I think people are fed up with that. It doesn't matter w hether you are in the Tea Party or Occupy Wall Street. People see that the gover nment is working for the powerful interests and the people who are well connecte d politically and not for the common person, which threatens that whole idea tha t we have this great opportunity, which we should have and have had historically in the West for anybody from whatever background to become successful. One way in which that becomes compromised is when the government is no longer seen as an honest agent and when our tax dollars are not really being put to work for us b ut for the people who are plugged in politically. You know, you have cases like [unclear], which I talk about and am involved in. You have Eric Holder, who is p robably the most corrupt attorney general we've had ever in American history. An d I think it's something, that if spun the right way and in simple terms, can ac tually resonate with the American people. Obama did not keep his promises. Nancy Pelosi, who was supposed to give us an honest Congress, has given us just the o pposite as speaker. And I think that's a campaign issue that can work well. I'm optimistic that you'll be elected president, and my recommendation would be to c lean house immediately ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: Yeah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Laughter]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEM BER: The S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. are disaster areas..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: I wish we weren't unionized so we could go a lot deeper than you are actually allowed to go. [To waiter] Am I in the way here? I can say this, and I'm sure you'll agree with this as well. We speak with voters across the country about their perceptio ns. Those people I told you, the 5 to 6 or 7 percent that we have to bring to o ur side, they all voted for Barack Obama four years ago. And by the way, when yo u say to them, do you think Barack Obama is a failure, if they were women, they say no. They like him. But when you say, are you disappointed that his policies haven't worked, they say yes. And because they voted for him, they don't want to be told that they were wrong, that he's a bad guy, that he does bad things, tha t he's corrupt. Those people that we have to get, they want to believe that they did the right thing but he just wasn't up to the task. They love the phrase tha t he's over his head. But you see, you and I, we spend our day with Republicans . We spend our days with people who agree with us. And these people are people who voted for him and don't agree with us. And so the things that animate us a re not the things that animate them. And the best success I have in speaking wi th those people is saying the president's been a disappointment. He told you he 'd keep unemployment below 8 percent. It hasn't been below 8 percent since. Fift y percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job. Fifty percent. Fifty pe rcent of the kids in high school in our 15 largest cities won't graduate from hi gh school. What are they going to do? These are the kinds of things that I can say to that audience that they nod their head and say, ''Yeah, I think you're ri ght.'' What he's going to do, by the way, is try to vilify me as someone who's b een successful, or who's closed businesses or laid people off, and isn't he an e vil, bad guy? And that may work. I actually think that right now people are sayi ng, ''I want someone who can make things better, that's going to motivate me. Wh o can get jobs for my kids and get rising incomes?'' And I hope to be able to be the one to poise that battle. Yeah, please.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD MEMBER: I've seen Obama a lot of times he's done talk shows, interviews. I've never seen you on any of them, and I think a lot of women [unintelligible] ... I think they would see you in a different light. I think a lot of women especially do not watch debates, d o not come to these functions. I think you have to show your face more on TV an d talk like a regular ... like a Smith. I think you could maybe reach a lot of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: Well, thank you. I have been on ''The View'' twice now .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Laughter]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It went very well. I've done the evening shows. I've been on Letterman a couple of times, I've been on Leno more than a couple of times, and now Letterman hates me because I've been on Leno more than him. They're very jealous of each other, as you know. And I was asked to go on ''Saturday Night L ive.'' I did not do that, in part because you want to show that you're fun and y ou're a good person, but you also want to be presidential. And ''Saturday Night Live'' has the potential of looking slapstick and not presidential. But ''The Vi ew'' is fine, although ''The View'' is high risk because of the five women on it , only one is conservative and four are sharp-tongued and not conservative, Whoo pi Goldberg in particular. Although the last time I was on the show, she said t o me, ''You know what? I think I could vote for you.'' And I said, ''I must hav e done something really wrong.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Laughter]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've got to sit down and . .. Darlene, you get the last word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DARLENE: I was just going to say, I thin k our media strategy would be sending Anne on ''The View.'' She is your best adv ocate, she connects so well, I mean, people talk so much about disconnect and so meone said over there that people use the term ''rich guy,'' and we know that yo u ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: You know I'm poor as a church mouse!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DARLENE: We kno w that you value [unintelligible] and hard work, but Anne really connects with w omen and she can tell a story and she's the perfect person who can go on Matt L auer and go on Victoria ... and go on ''The View'' and go on all of these people and really get the women connecting to you ... and I think she's a great ...&lt;PA &gt; MR. ROMNEY: I think you're right, I think you're absolutely right. We use A nne sparingly right now so that people don't get tired of her or start attacking .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DARLENE: Who gets tired of Anne?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Laughter]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. ROMNEY: But you will see more of her in the September-October time frame and you know, we had, what is her name, Hilary Rosen, who attacked her and that made Anne much more vi sible to the American people which I think is very helpful. Gave her a platform she wouldn't have had otherwise. And I agree with you, I think she will be extr aordinarily helpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DARLENE: Just the people who friended her on Facebook or whatever happened after the Hilary Rosen came out ... that showed you the val ue of social networking and how important new media can be in this election cycl e. And I just think she can be ... and I know she wants you to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. RO MNEY: She's out there. She's in Texas tonight, she was in Louisiana last night, she's raising money in those places. She was at Ben Crenshaw's house for dinner tonight, isn't that something? So there are some benefits. One of the benefits I get is eating the world's greatest dessert, which I will. Thank you.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man wearing a hard hat and jean overalls draped over a neon green T-shirt has his arms folded and stares sternly into the camera. St anding on a graveled railroad track, he speaks bluntly of the decline of the coa l industry as images of Ravenna, Ky., flash across the screen. The blame, he say s, is with President Obama, Representative Ben Chandler, a Democrat from Kentuck y, and the Environmental Protection Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This latest television ad from An dy Barr, the Lexington lawyer running as a Republican to unseat Mr. Chandler, ha s drawn sharp criticism from the incumbent - in large part because the man dress ed as a coal miner is a coal company executive who has contributed thousands of dollars to politicians, mostly Republicans, and has rubbed shoulders with the li kes of Mitt Romney and Karl Rove at fund-raising events. The executive, Heath Lo vell, vice president of River View Coal, does not live in Ravenna or anywhere in the district Mr. Barr is running for. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His ad is not only shame fully deceptive, but it's an insult to hard-working Kentucky coal miners who put their lives on the line every day to power our communities and our economy,&quot; Er ic Nagy, Mr. Chandler's campaign manager, said in a statement. &quot;Ben Chandler has a long history of fighting to protect coal jobs and ensure the safety of coal m iners, and Barr should be ashamed to use a corporate shill to suggest otherwise. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lovell and Mr. Barr's campaign pushed back forcefully, saying that Mr . Lovell started working in coal mines as a teenager and worked his way up to be come an executive. Mr. Lovell said his father and grandfather worked in coal min es. He still goes into the mine he manages every week, Mr. Lovell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;T hat was my hard hat in the video,&quot; he said. &quot;That was not some costume that I've put on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Host, a spokesman for Mr. Barr, said the idea for the ad wa s conceived during a jobs tour in the spring in which residents of Ravenna told the candidate that their town was once a thriving railroad hub that transported coal, but much of that industry has since vanished. Mr. Barr has blamed that on what his campaign describes as burdensome regulations put in place by the Enviro nmental Protection Agency, backed by Mr. Obama and Mr. Chandler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even thoug h Mr. Lovell was not from the area, he was speaking of problems the coal industr y faces statewide that he sees firsthand, Mr. Host said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What he has to sa y accurately reflects the sentiments of miners in his mine and across Kentucky, about the war on coal,&quot; Mr. Host said. &quot;They're concerned about their future, ab out their jobs. That certainly is something that the ad brings across.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chandler's campaign argues that he has been an important ally of the mining ind ustry, advocating for the safety and rights of miners and speaking out against o verreaching regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ad, Mr. Lovell stands in front of another m an dressed in miner's clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Devastating,&quot; he says. &quot;Four, five, six a day. Northbound. Southbound. Full rails, full of coal. Now near nothing.&quot; He goe s on to say that Mr. Obama, Mr. Chandler and the E.P.A. &quot;are destroying us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're putting the coal industry out of business, and it's just devastating, &quot; he adds. &quot;This is our way of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lovell and his wife, Lori, have d onated $21,400 to candidates for federal office over the past two years includin g to Mr. Romney and Rand Paul. Mr. Lovell was at a fund-raiser at the home of th e founder of Papa John's Pizza, according to pictures on his wife's Facebook pag e, one of which showed him making a pizza with Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Heath and Mitt Romney,&quot; Mr. Lovell's wife wrote about the picture. &quot;I am pretty sure this was t he greatest day of Heath's life!&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney on Tuesday fully embraced the substance of his secretly recorded comments that 47 percent of Americans are too dependent on government, saying that his views helped define the philosophical choice for voters in his campaign against President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The president's view is one of a larger government; I disagree,'' Mr. Romney said in an interview on Fox News. ''I think a society based on a government-centered nation where government plays a larger and larger role, redistributes money, that's the wrong course for America.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments were Mr. Romney's attempt to find some benefit in the political furor after the disclosure of statements he made at a closed fund-raiser in Florida in May, where he spoke of nearly half of Americans who pay no federal income taxes and, in his analysis, would never vote for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are people, he said at the fund-raiser, who are ''dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney, who on Monday called the remarks inelegant, suggested on Tuesday that it was time for a full debate about dependency, entitlements and what his campaign characterized as a long history of Mr. Obama's support for ''redistributionist'' policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite the effort by Mr. Romney to take the offensive, his campaign spent the day working to keep the episode from becoming a turning point in a campaign that until now has remained neck and neck, and trying to minimize the damage from the disclosure of another set of remarks from the fund-raiser, in which he suggested that a two-state solution for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians -- longstanding United States policy -- was not feasible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Republicans applauded Mr. Romney's determination not to back away from his statements about taxes and entitlements, which echo themes promoted in recent years by many conservatives, including Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan. Speaking to a Nevada TV station on Tuesday, Mr. Ryan echoed Mr. Romney's line of attack on Mr. Obama and government dependency, though he said Mr. Romney's comments were ''inarticulate.'' But the developments gave Democrats new ammunition to make their case that Mr. Romney is out of touch with the needs and values of the middle class and does not understand the economic forces at work in many families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also left some Republicans distancing themselves from Mr. Romney's remarks. And it forced the Romney campaign to adopt a new message just a day after starting an ad campaign built around different themes, as officials closely monitored whether donors were growing more nervous about the management of Mr. Romney's candidacy and his prospects in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an appearance on ''Late Show'' with David Letterman, Mr. Obama accused Mr. Romney of ''writing off a big chunk of the country'' and said it would be wrong for a politician to ''suggest that because someone doesn't agree with me that they're victims or they're unpatriotic.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the editing bays of the pro-Obama ''super PAC'' Priorities USA Action, producers were finding ways to splice bits of Mr. Romney's commentary at the fund-raiser into videos and television advertisements, a sign that the recordings will provide the Democrats fodder until Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Republican Senate candidates in hard-fought races in the Democratic territory of the Northeast, Senator Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts and Linda McMahon of Connecticut, disavowed the remarks. ''Not the way I view the world,'' Mr. Brown said; ''I disagree,'' Ms. McMahon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even some conservative intellectuals argued with Mr. Romney's description of the 47 percent of people who do not pay income taxes as Obama voters. They noted that among that 47 percent were potentially Romney-supporting ''seniors, who might well 'believe they are entitled to health care,' '' as the Weekly Standard editor William Kristol wrote, and ''lower-income Americans (including men and women serving in the military) who think conservative policies are better for the country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney effectively ceded that point in his interview with Neil Cavuto on Fox News, saying he was referring instead to ''those that are dependent on government and those that think government's job is redistribute -- I'm not going to get them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tension of the moment spilled out in unguarded moments with Mr. Romney's aides, one of whom likened the situation to a circus. Two advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity in separate interviews, expressed frustration that the comments at the fund-raiser -- held at the Boca Raton, Fla., home of the financier Marc Leder -- played into the image that Democrats have promoted all year of Mr. Romney as uncaring about average voters and concerned only about himself and his wealthy friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's campaign organized back-to-back conference calls to reassure donors, featuring a coterie of top advisers -- Matt Rhoades, the campaign manager; Spencer Zwick, the finance director; and Beth Myers and Ed Gillespie, both senior advisers. One of the calls, with Mr. Romney's national finance committee, was moved up from its usually scheduled time near the end of the week, and on the second, larger donor call, the campaign urged the donors to ''have at it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later on Tuesday, National Review reported that Mr. Romney had faced such a cash shortage while awaiting the ability to spend his general election money that he had to borrow $20 million in August to get him through the end of his convention. The money was easily covered by his general election account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney's aides said that they were keeping perspective in a way that the news media ''feeding frenzy'' was not. A Gallup daily tracking poll that had shown Mr. Obama with a growing edge after the Democratic convention effectively had the race as a tie on Tuesday, though an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday night showed the president with more of an edge and with his approval rating reaching the 50 percent mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Romney's aides played down the significance of the recordings, they said they were most unwelcome because they yet again kept Mr. Romney from getting back to his message on the economy, delivering a clearer sense to voters of where he would lead the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Every day that he is not talking about jobs he is losing an opportunity to draw a contrast with the president's abysmal record on the economy,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. Referring to Medicare and Social Security, she said she feared that his comments at the fund-raiser would paint him as being against ''earned programs that people pay into'' and have ''widespread support.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He has just not brought sufficient clarity to what his vision for America is,'' Ms. Collins said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the country Republicans reacted with a mix of trepidation and defiance. Joe Gruters, chairman of the Republican Party of Sarasota, Fla., said he believed it would ''play into his strength,'' while Steve Armstrong, chairman of the Linn County, Iowa, Republicans, called it ''an unfortunate mistake.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said he believed that Mr. Romney would ultimately win the argument on substance, but cautioned that Republicans need to show that ''they are concerned about every American.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;President Obama's decline in the Gallup and Rasmussen Reports national tracking polls has caused his chance of winning the Electoral College to slip. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has been on the decline in the FiveThirtyEight forecast. On Tuesday, his chance of winning the Electoral College dropped to 72.9 percent, from 74.8 percent on Monday. Mr. Obama is now well off his peak in the forecast, 80.8 percent, which he reached on Sept. 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's causing the change? There are two major factors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, Mr. Obama has experienced an unmistakable decline in the two longest-running tracking polls, Gallup and Rasmussen Reports. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Gallup survey, Mr. Obama's lead fell to one point over Mitt Romney on Tuesday - the same number that he started with before the Democratic convention, and down from a high of a seven-point lead last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has similarly lost his bounce in the Rasmussen Reports tracking poll; in the version published on Tuesday, he was tied with Mr. Romney when voters who leaned toward a candidate were included in the tabulation, and trailed him by two points otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are other tracking polls that show more ambiguous results. Mr. Obama's bounce has held steady (or perhaps even improved slightly) in the online tracking poll published by the RAND Corporation, showing that he maintained a lead of about three points over the past week. The Ipsos online tracking poll had Mr. Obama with a four-point lead on Tuesday, down from a peak of seven points, although that poll has been volatile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Gallup and Rasmussen Reports polls can have a lot of influence on the forecast at times when there is a potential turning point in the race. The trendline adjustment that the model calculates compares changes in the results produced by the same polling firms over time. Since the Gallup and Rasmussen Reports national tracking polls have been published almost every day since the spring, they represent highly important data series in this process. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second major reason for the shift is that the model is designed to take a skeptical view of the polls conducted for a candidate who just held his convention. Typically, the polling bounce that a candidate receives from his convention does not evaporate immediately, but can persist for a couple of weeks. We are still close enough to the Democratic convention that this adjustment applies to Mr. Obama's numbers in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The downward adjustment to Mr. Obama's numbers will gradually fade out over the next week or so. Thus, if he holds his current position in the polls, he will begin to regain ground in the FiveThirtyEight forecast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is probably not a bad idea to take a slightly skeptical view toward Mr. Obama's polls in the meantime. This is a tricky year for estimating convention bounces, with the two parties having held their conventions just one week apart, but if the model is reading the data wrongly, it will correct itself soon enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's state polls have also been fairly mixed over the last week. He has certainly gotten a few very strong ones, like a Washington Post poll on Tuesday that put him eight points ahead among likely voters in Virginia. But there have been other surveys to show rather poor results for him, like a Rasmussen Reports poll that put him two points behind in Colorado. In general, the impression conveyed by the state polls is a fairly modest bounce in the swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, it might be acknowledged that this is among the more confusing periods that we've seen in the polls. How do you reconcile a poll showing Mr. Obama with an eight-point lead in Virginia with another putting him at a two-point deficit in Colorado? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why, if his standing eroded in the Gallup and Rasmussen Reports tracking polls, did he also receive a rather strong poll from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, which put him five points ahead nationally among likely voters?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These polls almost seem to inhabit different universes. As I'll describe in a separate article, the methodological choices made by pollsters may have something to do with it; Mr. Obama's bounce has been much more noticeable in polls that use live interviewers and that call cellphones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it does not do any good to pretend there is a consensus in the polls when there isn't. Sometimes there is simply no alternative to remaining patient until one emerges. The downward trend for Mr. Obama in the Gallup and Rasmussen trackers is closest thing we have to a theme in the polls for the time being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Impact of '47 Percent' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has also been the introduction of a new event in the news cycle:the release of a video, taped secretly, showing impolitic comments that Mr. Romney made at a fund-raiser. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I begin from the premise that there is reason to be skeptical that Mr. Romney's &quot;47 percent&quot; comments will have all that much effect on the polls. The news media often jumps the gun in declaring events to be &quot;game changers&quot; when they later prove to little effect on the numbers. Mr. Romney's comments about Libya last week, for instance, were supposed to be very damaging to him, but if anything the numbers have moved toward him since then. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do not mean to suggest that campaign controversies like this one never matter to voters. But I do think that reporters in Washington or New York, myself included, are not always the best judges of which are the exceptional cases. Furthermore, these judgments are likely to beinfluenced by the recent polls, meaning that analyses anticipating future reaction among voters may really be lagging indicators. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have my own instincts about Mr. Romney's remarks, which are roughly as follows: even if his outlook is a bit less negative than it seemed a week ago, he is nevertheless the underdog in the race, and not in a position where he can afford to alienate any voters who might allow him to climb to 50 percent of the vote. His coalition may already be drawn too narrowly, and this won't help him with that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I'd place rather little value on my instincts, and rather more on the polls. We should know more about the state of the campaign a week from now than we do today.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The now-infamous 47 percent video - secretly taped at a Mitt Romney donor event in May - is still reverberating in media circles as well as political ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mother Jones, which posted the full version of the video Tuesday, enjoyed one of its best days online, according to Clara Jeffery, one of the magazine's co-editors. James Carter IV, the unemployed researcher who helped bring the video to light, received a congratulatory note from his grandfather, the former president Jimmy Carter. (Earlier, Ben Smith at BuzzFeed chronicled the video's long strange trip to Mother Jones.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama had a public opportunity to respond to the video during his appearance on &quot;Late Show&quot; with David Letterman, saying that Mr. Romney &quot;was writing off a big chunk of the country.&quot; As Bill Carter reports, the host also managed a reference to Clint Eastwood's performance at the Republican National Convention and &quot;got an immediate laugh by noting the empty spot next to the president and asking: 'Is there anything you want to say to the empty chair?'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barry Diller, the chief of IAC/InterActiveCorp, and Scott Rudin, the Broadway and Hollywood impresario, are getting into the e-book business. The pair have teamed up with Frances Coady, a publishing industry veteran, to invest in The Atavist, the Brooklyn-based electronic book publisher. The new venture, called Brightline, will look to eventually publish physical books as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple, which has aggressively gone after its rivals in commercials like &quot;1984&quot; and its series of &quot;Mac vs. PC&quot; ads, is now on the receiving end. Samsung, which recently lost a billion dollar patent case to Apple, has been taking direct aim at the new iPhone in a series of print ads, including one with the headline &quot;It doesn't take a genius.&quot; On the blog Gizmodo, Apple fans immediately began retaliating with their own parodies based on the Samsung ads, one with the headline &quot;Don't settle for cheap plastic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magazine Closer, which recently published topless photos of Kate Middleton, has been ordered by a French court to stop all distribution of the pictures and to hand over the originals to the royal family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in France, the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo has published cartoons mocking the prophet Muhammad, setting off another wave of protests in the Middle East. In New York ads calling Islamic jihad &quot;savage,&quot; will soon appear in subways after a federal court ruled that the transit authority could not refuse the ads, which were purchased by the American Freedom Defense Initiative, a pro-Israeli group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC's hit show &quot;The Voice&quot; will add Usher and Shakira as stand-in judgeswhile two of the show's biggest stars, Christina Aguilera and Cee Lo Green, take one season off to record and tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Steve Sabol, for years the creative force behind NFL Films, the revered and much satirized chronicler of the football league, has died at the age of 69.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mitt Romney's campaign released two ads criticizing the administration's policies on coal mining. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney trailsPresident Obama significantly in several key demographics&nbsp;- women and Hispanics chief among them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one area where he remains far more competitive with the president is among men. And he holds a sizable lead over the president with men who do not have college diplomas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working-class men&nbsp;- a lot of them&nbsp;- appear in two new ads from the Romney campaign, which feature coal workers lamenting effects of the Obama administration's policies on their industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's ruining the coal industry,&quot; says one doleful-looking coal worker in an ad called &quot;War on Coal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're wanting to close these mines down. I've got little ones at home, a wife who needs me,&quot; says another worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second ad, called &quot;Way of Life,&quot; features one worker who says, &quot;The policies that the current administration has got is attacking my livelihood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both ads play to the theme that government regulations, which Mr. Romney frequently points out have grown under the Obama administration, are creating a climate that is hostile to businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also touch on a notion that Republican pollsters have found is especially powerful with swing voters: That many Americans are anxious about what kind of world their children will live in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got two young grandsons. I'm scared for their future, let alone mine,&quot; the coal worker says.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Brooks: Gail, greetings from Dulles International Airport. I'm in a little clutch of travelers huddling around the electrical chargers like Napoleon's soldiers around the fire on the retreat from Moscow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gail Collins: David, airports are meant to make people crazy. I can understand why they might not be able to make the flights leave on time, but if they weren't plotting to torture us, they would at least put more outlets in the walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David: Meanwhile there's some jerk barking business orders into his cellphone at about 85 decibels, drowning out the 747s outside. Can I make the point that just because it is legal to use your phone in crowded places does not mean that it is moral?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gail: Oh Lord, I do sympathize. We need a phone app that would allow everybody in the vicinity of one of those yellers to vote on whether or not they think their conversation sounds interesting. The results would be displayed on the loud person's cell in bright red letters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David: Speaking of things that got under my skin, there were Mitt Romney's fund-raiser comments, as you may have heard. My official reaction was in my column this week, but underneath I couldn't help thinking about the visits I've made to community colleges around the country. These schools are attended by people whose families are often on food stamps and public assistance. When they get out, many of them won't be making enough money to pay income tax. Yet if you look at how they live - long bus rides, endless studying, full or part-time jobs on the side, complicated family issues - do we really want to call them society's freeloaders? It's just offensive and detached from reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gail: Is this going to go down as the week the Romney campaign officially lost you?&nbsp; On Monday, it sounded as if they were listening to your brave - albeit hopeless -- calls for them to be specific about their policy positions. They were going to give details! They didn't, but there was at least one brief shining moment when they seemed to feel guilty. And then of course the loser-moocher 47 percent video surfaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David: Putting the substance aside, what do you make of the politics of it? Frankly, I'm not sure how much it hurts. Did Obama's &quot;clinging&quot; comments have a big effect four years ago or his &quot;you didn't build that&quot; remark? Voters are so cynical about politicians, nothing surprises them.&nbsp; What do you think?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gail: You never can tell what's really going to resonate. A wise man told me recently that Paul Ryan's policy fibs at the convention didn't matter but the one about running a sub-three-hour marathon was devastating. It probably depends on whether seniors on Social Security realize he was talking about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David: I guess what's been most depressing for me is the long string of mistakes the Romney campaign has made. They didn't define their candidate over the summer, while Obama pounded away. They pick Ryan and then don't make the case for the Ryan proposals. They waste the convention by offering nothing. Then when they say they are going to get more specific, they mostly end up just going small. As a growth agenda, they suggest they are going to crack down on Chinese trade. That's triviality on stilts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gail: David, it does make me sad to hear you so disheartened. Although not in a way that would make me wish Romney was doing any better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David:&nbsp; I didn't expect romance from the Romney campaign, but I did expect some sort of smooth professionalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gail: I did like it when they said they were going to respond to voters' desire for more details with an exciting new ad campaign, and then unveiled a 30-second TV spot that said: Mitt Romney is in favor of education and small business!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David: Having done all this kvetching, I still think Romney has a decent shot at winning. The country is heading in the wrong direction. The Democrats are much more liberal than the median voter, especially on role-of-government issues. Obama is intellectually exhausted and the country wants a change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gail: I am way too paranoid to argue that Obama's pulling ahead, although deep down I do sort of feel that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when you're talking about people who are intellectually exhausted, I give you the Republican presidential herd. McCain? Romney? I know you think Paul Ryan is a great idea guy, but the campaign has come to realize that once the public gets a good look at his great ideas, they run the other way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David: No matter how much Romney screws up, I get the sense that the country is asking permission to switch leaders. Romney is making it hard, but they just keep asking. I see, for example, that the Gallup daily tracking poll has Obama up by 1 percentage point. The convention bounce is gone. The fundamental gravitational forces of the election still apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gail: I don't agree, David. Any Republican campaign that leaves you this depressed is in big trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David:&nbsp; Of course as I sit here, surrounded by loud-talkers who are in danger of having a laptop shoved down their throats, I don't know what the public reaction to freeloadergate will be. Memo to conservatives: Don't hate America. Don't hate even 47 percent of America. It's unattractive and it's always wrong.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mitt Romney's campaign released an ad highlighting the drop in average household income in the context of the Obama presidency. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its matter-of-fact &quot;this or that&quot; cadence, this 30-second ad recalls the famous 1980s &quot;This is your brain on drugs&quot; commercials. &quot;This was household income when President Obama took office; this was the national debt,&quot; an announcer says as a bar chart adjusts accordingly, with the national debt bar growing as the income bar falls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The image then shifts to Mr. Romney explaining to an audience that he would cut government spending. &quot;We can't keep buying and spending and passing on debts to our kids. And I'll stop it,&quot; he says as a shot of a woman in a cap and gown hugging a child is shown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By highlighting the drop in average household income - which the ad puts in the context of the Obama presidency, ignoring that incomes began falling when George W. Bush was still in office - Mr. Romney is reinforcing a point he makes repeatedly: that Americans are not better off today than they were four years ago.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Romney has a lot of catching up to do among women. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll has Mr. Obama up by 12 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this ad, the Romney campaign highlights economic statistics that, standing on their own, suggest that the economic picture for women is far worse than it is for men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what Obama's policies have done for women,&quot; an announcer says, in a rebuttal to Mr. Obama's claims that Republicans have waged a &quot;war on women.&quot; As a chubby-cheeked baby girl plays in her mother's arms, the announcer says, &quot;Welcome, daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true, as the ad points out, that the poverty level among women, at 16.3 percent, is the highest in 17 years, according to the Census Bureau. But the unemployment rate for men is 8.3 percent; for women it is 7.8 percent. The ad also notes that more than 5.5 million women are unemployed, about a half-million more than when Mr. Obama took office. But the ad does not say that the number of unemployed women started to rise sharply in 2008, before he took office, and has come down from a peak of 6.4 million in 2010.</SPAN></P>
